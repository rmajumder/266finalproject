limited but powerful. the quickbooks app for the ipad works well with the online system. some limitations are inherent with the app that you have to go to the web based system from the desktop to accomplish. you can't create a statement with dunning notices, but you can send the invoice! from the job site, a quick invoice to the client helps improve cash flow and enhance customer relations.
ios 13 not supported. the app will not even start!
love this app!. easy to use on the go!
very misleading. you think it‚Äôs going to be free and then they want to charge you why don‚Äôt they just put the freaking amount they want upfront on the original ad.
good and bad. i converted from xero and i am finding quickbooks has its advantages & disadvantages. i don‚Äôt like how the custom invoices are so restricted with gst. the mobile app banking function is excellent.
awesome app, love quickbooks. use it often to add expenses and check bank data. nice feature of receipt photo, works great
google calendar. it would be nice to be able to sync google calendar with the mobile app for invoices like you can do on the mac app.
great app!. very userfriendly and convenient. great for people who are needing to create invoices and estimates and track expenses. the iphone app is fantastic!
awesome!. it has helped me to collect unpaid invoices more efficiently and i've collected more money because unpaid invoices are not forgotten about until they have been paid.
bugs. there are alot of bugs in the app. i am about to go back to square. the app keep giving alot of errors.
almost perfect. just missing two things, edit or view notes online, and no touch id needed any time i try to open the app
a changing life app. i‚Äôm new to the u.s and this app helps a lot to get organized. just love it.
doesn‚Äôt always work. says it can‚Äôt show details on invoices. annoying.
great accounting. the app is great and syncs perfectly with my quickbooks online account. makes billing from multiple sites quick and easy on the go.
6s, ios 9.x. it takes a while to learn the nuances of this app (and the online interface), but once you do, a decent enough experience awaits. note to devs: the app freezes anytime you review added attachments (eg, receipts) when inputting expenses.
missing. really enjoy the service helping me to stay organized, but the app is missing a lot of the features on webpage or desktop version
great for attaching receipts, not for entering expenses. i love being able to take photos of invoices and receipts and directly attach them to the expense. however, i am unable to add expenses because the app does not have access to my accounts or categories. if there was even a save as a draft option, i would give this a 55. however, i am not able to save any input if i can‚Äôt add the account or categories.
amazing. i haven't seen smart accounting software like this üëçüèº
invaluable tool!. qbo app is invaluable for me as a small business owner. having access to all my funicular data, customer records and invoicing is fantastic! the app works flawlessly.
excellent program. i have tried office and unless you no the formulas it doesn‚Äôt work. absolutely love how easy this is!
crashes. app is unusable after ios 13.0 update.. crashes. app is unusable after ios 13.0 update.
freezes. freezes when saving a new client. app is useless.
not a replacement. not fast. doesn't sync well.. this app needs a lot of work to be reliable and usable. no matter how many times i sync it doesn't actually sync to the web apps data. it keeps logging me off the fingerprint option. this might be designed in there because human fingerprints change very often? correct?
great for my small business. getting used to generating invoices and managing the books. perfect for me.
big learning curve to start, but very powerful. it was hard work to start with (owing to my limited knowledge), but good online tutorials and support helped a lot  very happy with the package now after a few months of getting my head around it!
offres aux nouveaux clients. je suis client depuis le d√©but nous avons eu beaucoup de probl√®mes au lancement, le support √©tait moyen... aujourd'hui il y a beaucoup d'offres pour les nouveaux clients mais rien pour les clients fid√®les. et une fois en place... impossible ou presque de partir et d'exporter ses donn√©es pour un logiciel sans abonnement. le produit est d√©sormais fonctionnel et agr√©able mais cher pour une petite compagnie.
crashes 48 times per day. app crashes over and over, saying you need to log in again for critical updates. there are no updates availability, and deleting and reinstalling the app doesn‚Äôt help. it‚Äôs frustrating because it takes 20 minutes to enter customer information, because you need to finish and hit that save button before the next crash. best to just use quickbooks in the browser, even though that isn‚Äôt perfect. four stars with no crashes.
efficient. good to have access on any device. does a great job but a little more customisation for service industry would be good. overall very efficient bookkeeping solution.
pathetic. so i have quickbooks, a banking transaction fails, they straight away stop you from using quickbooks, what a unprofessional outfit this is.
excellent. excellent for the ipad love i can do invoicing on the go
major problems with the newest update!!!. the app was working great until a few days ago. now i cannot receive payments on my iphone due to a bug in the app and i also cannot send an invoice via email on my iphone or ipad now. ‚òπÔ∏è
horrible. can't stand the program or customer support
app doesn‚Äôt get updated with the website!. this is most ridiculous app! it doesn‚Äôt get updated with the website! they charge you $40.00 per month with no resolution in the near future.
update broke. i cannot accept transactions. the only things accessible on the baking screens are back and trash. please fix otherwise it‚Äôs useless.
limited, buggy, slow... this a majorly limited version of quickbooks online. you really can't do much with it. it also crashes often and is extremely, painstakingly slow. but so is qb online for that matter.
latest update won't open!. latest update crashes immediately.
nice apps. nice apps
scott. i find the app to be a great addition to the desktop version. having access to all invoices and customers through my phone is excellent.
absolutely terrible!!!!!. this app is garbage. funny that intuit is in their name because there is nothing intuitive about anything in this app at all. complete waste of time!!! complete garbage. just trying to set up the basic information about accounts that i use and tailor the app to my needs was excruciating. i can‚Äôt say enough about how bad this is!!!!!!
nice app. good to run the business with this app
not easy to do it all on app. find trying to complete and send vat return a headache. also we use coop bank doesn‚Äôt tie up with qb nor does it with starling business bank
where the banking. i want to accept transactions while i sit in bed, this app is far from useful without that capability, come on intuit, make the app complete. as is, a total let down!
fast and efficient time saver. works a treat across all my devices, keeps my accounts up to date and all invoices issued in a timely manner
great software. i have come to really like quick books online. quoting, invoicing, reports and my personal favourite... it links with your bank account to automate expense inputs. you set the rules once and the next time a similar transaction appears in your linked bank account it automatically categorises the transaction for you, just hit 'add'. saves me so much time and effort and to me it's fast becoming a business tool i simply wouldn't be without.
garbage. quick books won‚Äôt upload garbage use and other accounting software.
doesn‚Äôt work with ios13. pls fix
perfect app for any small business owner. as a qbo pro advisor my opinion may be somewhat biased but i can not brag enough about the software, customer support and resources offered by quickbooksintuit. qbo has allowed me to become a completely virtual bookkeeping firm, increasing my service area, customer satisfaction and turn around time. love love love them!!
solid. i like that it keeps sync of everything smoothly. there's no wait time, and if so i never notice it. it's fast and convenient. best accounting software hands down!
utter crap. if i could give no stars i would app crashes all the time won't send invoices to customers i have had for years have been struggling on with quickbooks for several years but now can't take the frustration anymore caused by this utter waste of money.
great app. i use apple products and it works great for us. get paid quick with credit cards or bank transfers.
don't bother. been using qb desktop for years. disapointed in the sasmobile version. mobile app is slow and frequently fails to load at all. not much functionality at all besides creating invoices. checking account balances or customer ar is not worth the bother on mobile app. this is an ok solution. i bet there are better options available than qb mobile app.
productivity. love all the intuit products. helps run my business professionally. been able to do my own scorp taxes and payroll for a couple years now. saving me thousands over a cpa and payroll company like in previous years. business owner now for 26 years
new user; i love it. i am amazed at what all i can accomplish with my iphone while traveling. best app on my phone.
glad i got it. i got this app when my computer crashed and it was the best thing that happened to my small business
not useful. hard to use. logs out when you switch screens. fields not consistent.
getting worse. new update takes over 5 mins to load every time i sign in on my iphone. constantly says that i'm not connected to a data network when i clearly am. they've made point of sale a hurdle now. still can't look up customers by address or phone number. makes me look like a two bit operation when i quickly need information while in the field. i'm currently exploring other options to leave antiquated qbo behind.
excellent invoice and stock update tool. this is so much more convenient than other accounting tool or software. i was able to send bills sitting in a remote destination and also input product purchase and services as and when the job was getting done. there is no time waisted by yourself as well as customers waiting for billing. excellent product.
new update. i love the app and it has been great for us for years. however, the new update does not allow a custom date range for reports and when you edit an invoice it gives you a small screen that not everything fits on. please bring back the custom date range and make is so we can see everything on edits.
problems. when it works it's good. have to sign out and back in or it crashes when customers need to be entered, along with other options.
awesome app. i really like this app, i can track all my incomes and expenses, it shows my net profit and everything else i could possibly need. i really enjoy using this app.
mr. recent updates have slowed both the phone and computer app to a crawl. very frustrating. otherwise a very good app on my phone.
absolutely amazing highly recommend. way better then xero and myob.
good, but needs to get better. quickbooks online is a welcome change from the shackles of the desktop version, but there are still key features and functionality missing (in the app as well as in the browser) to really make this useful. like.... being able to manually adjust the amount of sales tax on a general journal entry.
very convenient and usable. great app that connects me too my work platform everywhere i go!!
great. great app i use it everyday, makes invoices a breeze and makes it easier at the end of the year for tax purposes.
great!. continues to impress and improve on this very useful app. i use it daily for bids, invoices and expenses. the addition of the ability to record expenses and photograph receipts has made my life so much more easy. and to be able to quickly add clients, easy estimates and quick invoices and finally receive payments is unbelievable and wonderful.
i like it. i have enjoyed using this app for the last year. i am blind and it is 99% accessible with my screen reader, voiceover. i only want to report one error. the last update causes the app to crash when trying to edit an expense entry my accountant manages my quickbooks online account, however, when i find an incorrect category has been applied, i cannot fix it. the app crashes when i attempt
glitchy and they keep raising prices. constantly crashing, both the ios app and the mac version. and they just raised the price to $60month. not worth it.
signature box not wroking. when client tries to sign in box on a credit card transaction with a apple pencil or with finger the box moves around. no signature is captured.
it's exactly the apps i need. simple to use. have all the features i need for my food truck business
love it. i am an accountant and this is the software i use and recommend to all of my customers.
no complaints. does the job.
streamlines my life. love the app. user friendly. will give it 5 stars when it has photo recognition of my receipts and auto populates data from the photo.
impressed. i put off upgrading to online version after using quickbooks pro for five years, struggling to enter online direct debit expenses and payments. online version makes entering data easy and efficient. such a time saver for me. well done intuit! definitely worth the monthly subscription fee.
great app so far. great app. one thing needed i‚Äôd making it easier to change customers info when doing a new invoice for a previous customer but at a new address.
overall ok. if you have an issue good luck getting a hold of customer support. freezes up at least once a week and sometimes i can‚Äôt get into my invoices. for what i am paying for i expect more
ceo of gd2k. this is a really good app it has help our business in so many ways. it help boost our profit margin we have been able to close deals, and make invoices right on the spot. i recommend this for a lot of different business with quickbooks online.
must buy two services. i‚Äôm selfemployed and need to track miles as well as be able to send estimates. with ‚Äúquickbooks selfemployed‚Äù you can track miles but you cannot send estimates. with ‚Äúquickbooks online‚Äù you can send estimates but you cannot track mileage. to me, these things should be doable with the same serviceapp but here they are not. plus, customer service is not educated on their product or helpful.
qb ol user. i almost can't believe they actually released this to the public. it is only half an accounting system. all you can do is see outstanding invoices. it is at best a limited reporting system. it is not a way to control a business.. a long way to go before even thinking about paying $0.99 for it ..
disaster. was forced to use qb online due to always changing fees for desktop version. always crashes. hard to use. terrible. wish i could use another program.
simple and easy. great for keeping tabs on your business on the go but would love to have the actual versus budget comparison on the dashboard instead of having to bring up a report.
mgrm. great app. useful and easy to use. sample and easy to use
great app. one of the best app on my ipad. great for auto repair invoicing. +++++
very nice app. very easy to use and make my all estimates and invoices very smooth and keep the updates very soon
superb. the app on the iphone is great. works perfectly and great for quick invoicing. the ipad app is even better as provides much more in depth information. even better both apps work seamlessly with each other. don't know what i would do without this app.
pros and cons. it definitely takes some getting used to compared to the previous versions of quickbooks i've used. but with some changes to what i'm used to and working with the software and its workflow it works out. the payments thing makes sending and receiving invoices works really well. adding expenses by taking pictures of the receipts keeps my clutter box of receipts free. still needs some improvement but my overall experience hasn't been bad.
new receipt identification is much worse. the new version of the identification of receipts when taking a picture to upload to an expense is much much worse than the previous implementation. this version hasn‚Äôt worked accurately once in 30+ pictures, whereas the old version worked accurately 90%+ of the time. how does this stuff get through testing...? :
unable to access quickbooks through ipad. everytime time i try to access the quickbooks it says i need to verify first my login which can be verified by sending an email. when i choose this option it says the time has ran out and goes back to the login menu. i am able to get in through the web but never in the app
good app but. it‚Äôs a good app but you should be able to mark invoices as paid and deposited via the app. my paid invoices are regularly, incorrectly shown as unpaid. i have to wait until i have time to go on my laptop and mark them as paid via the website
good enough for readonly. this app is good for knowing which clients owe money and how much. great for seeing payments and invoices. but don't try to get my realwork done on this. so i use it in a pinch when i need to look up a client or vendor.
top notch app for businesses. makes it so easy to run my business on the go!!!!
super & excellent apps. very user friendly application . i would recommend this software to other people
good deal. i appreciate this app. it helps me keep an eye on my business so i'm not always sitting in front of my laptop.
wonderful app!!!. couldn't sing the praises high enough. i run a small, single member managed llc and the quickbooks online app is everything i need. i can create and send invoices and sales receipts on the go, even have the customer sign right on my iphone or ipad.
really bad app. this app is really bad, lacks everything you would want from a app that is suppose to work with you online quick books. no registry access!
love this version of quickbooks!. we have multiple companies and run quickbooks in everyone of them. however, the last company we started i decided to use the online version to run this company mobile and absolutely love it! the app does need some accessibility features that are only available on the full version but it is still very user friendly.
app will not open after update. app will not open on my iphone, making it impossible to input expenses and worse still accept payment on jobs!
lacking. there is zero way to customize reports on the go. it does not import saved reports from pc version. it really adds nothing  i'm better off keeping track of what i need to do and then do it on my pc.
"""quickbooks + square"". great app!!"
dissapointed. this is the frontline of my business as i am a mobil service technician. app no longer will save or complete an invoice. this is crippling my business! fixxxxxx please immediately!
phenomenal. quickbooks app on my phone combined with the online system is the best thing to happen to my new small business. i no longer feel like an accountant full time & business owner part time!
comprehensive app for a small business. i have excellent experience and is easy to use with all functionality that i required. have tried xero, myob as well but quickbooks stand out for me as far as feature & function and good value for money.
great app. just started to use. easy to navigate. have had no issues.
no support. very disappointed i am no longer able to access p&l or balance sheets on ipad. it‚Äôs been over 1 month and still the brain trust cannot make it work...
game changer!!!. highly recommend qbo for any business trying to keep up with the cloud. the cloud is the future. for our needs converting to qbo from desktop was the winning choice. qb is constantly improving and it shows. we had a lot of people advising us to dive into the desktop version more but i followed my gut feeling. glad i did. it's my opinion that the desktop will be a dinosaur very soon.
cannot download all data since last update. since enabling touched, after the last update, i keep getting notified all my data cannot be downloaded
bank account sync issues. when it properly syncs with your bank account it works great. takes a file for qbo to help with syncing issues.
best move ever. glad we use the online version because it is easier when not in office to get to our information
user friendly but not without fault. works nicely. has a few issues. the receipt camera assist is terrible. the phone version is user friendly but very slow. overall gets the job done, as long as you have time and patience...
going okay. i‚Äôm happy so far. love the bank link up, did four months of data entry in two hours i sent my first quote. i‚Äôm using an iphone 8 plus and will use as customer interface which i look for to when i get printer.. however i note that i will have to log on via a pc the set some things up as i don‚Äôt get that option on the app. love the finger i‚Äôd sign in
awesome. works great never had an issue with yet to date
how bad????. i would love to write a review, but as i've been trying to get this app to log in to my online account for 5 months now it's going to be a little difficult. but not as difficult as trying to get any customer support for this app. i could write a whole book on how impossible that is. so so disappointed. no help with this problem what so ever. frustrated!!!!!
excellent. quickbooks online works great for me and makes my work much easier especially with the phone app
great app. love having qb on my phone to receive payments, send invoices and other routine activities.
great for mobile small business !. we couldn't live without our quickbooks online mobile app! look up information and match bank transactions right away. would like to see more functionality for customer and vendor invoicing and billing options as well as filtering but overall a great, easy to use tool.
great app!. an awesome compliment to the web version. addition of balance sheet would be beneficial. cheers!
response to the quickbooks online account app. i love quickbooks accountant online program; but i noticed that there are limits to the quickbooks accountant online app capabilities compared to what the downloadable online quickbooks accountant software program could do. otherwise, really happy with online quickbooks accountant program!!
like the format. good app
excellent. great software
where are the invoices??. what is the point of an accounting app that does not show supplier invoices? dreadful. support was as helpful as a chocolate teapot too ...
need to be able to access full site. maybe i haven't had enough coffee but most mobile apps allow one to bypass the app and go straight to the web based version. this is frustrating  trying to quickly locate a reconcile issue in the register and can't see the data i need to effectively do so...
are you kidding me?. do i really have to download my company data every time i write an invoice or add an expense?! i have a feeling you are going to lose a lot of customers if you don't change it back to how it used to work. very dissatisfied with how long it takes to download company data.
qbo app. luv the new dashboard!! excellent app. no complaints.
j'aime. tr√®s bonne logicielle pour les petits entreprises
very easy to use. the app is fantastic as it is very user friendly and has everything i need. i've used myob in the past and that was terrible compared to the quickbooks app; which is in line with the times.
great app. loving it  i love keeping track of expenses on the go.
horrible horrible app. this new version is terrible! it will not save invoices for payments when i apply them, but then when i log in to the desktop version there's duplicate and triplicate payments.
not like the online version. the app is alright. missing a lot of feature (if you compare it to the online version) but if they come up with a solution and have them on the app version i would rate it 5 stars.
love it so easy to use.. what a great app simple to use and the support is there if you need. would differently recommend it to anyone who runs a small business.
app crashes constantly. i used to love this app. the last couple of months the app crashes daily and multiple times. i‚Äôm in the middle of working and the app says critical updates are needed and logs me out. i‚Äôm extremely frustrated with this considering i pay over $20month to use this software across all my devices.
best app i've used!. i started my small business with quickbooks and i was able todo everything in one application! from sale receipts, expenses, lodging gst and more. i would highly recommend quickbooks to all business owners
almost usless. the app does not show all the info like logging in from a pc. also scrolling up or down on a page is very glitchy. quickbooks has a lot of work to do on making this app useful.
best accounting app except for some glitch. it is the best accounting app that i had so far. i like the inventory part. what i don't like is that the activities for the suppliers are empty but with the web and desktop app the activities appear.
still unresolved issues 3 month later. i‚Äôve had quickbooks for over 3 month now and since i‚Äôve had it i have been unable to allocate my bank transactions on my app. i‚Äôve flagged this to quickbooks and had responses but no fix. keep being told to use desktop version for now! 3 months and still not fixed isn‚Äôt good enough for a payed for app.
quickbooks accountant online. user friendly, accessible from anywhere on any device.
requires an account with email and ‚Äòphone number instantly. no. deleted instantly.
so messy and confusing.. iphone app is so messy and confusing. desktop version struggles so much to gather my company info, and there really isn't much. errors out all the time.
owner. online is getting better with each update still has a few more options i would to able to perform from mobile and laptop being using qbooks for 11 yr
overall but problems. overall works well for small business. a lot of problems with checking account and credit card connections. one i am still going to have to sort through to make sure transactions weren't missed, as it only loads back 90 days. and you get no notification if an account suddenly disconnects. its a mess but customer service is good and they work with you well.
so easy to use. quickbooks is simple to understand and has everything a business needs with easy access from any device. i love how simple it is to use and also can rest knowing there is help on the phone 'talking to someone in australia' if and when it's needed. it covers everything a business needs to run successfully. i wouldn't use anything else for my small business
i love it my business run a lot smoother!!!. our customers are loving our new system
very powerful tool. the app is really nice and efficient. will get even better when the ability to create a credit note is made available on both ios and android devices. i really don't understand why this must have feature has not been added yet. thanks!
ios13. keeps crashing won‚Äôt open since update. not helpful!!
amazing app!. very good app! helps you learn a lot about coding!
stopping subscription. originally a useful app, but keeps crashing following the most recent update on 27.09. will have to stop subscription and find something that works, so whats the point in updating the app if you lose customers?
best app ever. i am a tech on the go , and we made the switch from paper invoicing to quick books online. i cannot tell you how much this app saves me on time and frustration , everything is there at the tip of your finger. thanks intuit for making my work that much easier!
easy to use. love this app, easy to use.
app problems. app keeps crashing haven‚Äôt been able to create invoices for days
ouch. does not have my bank listed. does me no good. been paying for 1 year now. and i see no where how to stop subscribing. cost me over $10.00 a month.
issues, stick w square. poorly designed and lots of crashes, wish i had stayed with square. we have the entire business suite and try to have all the qb parts save us time but i honestly think it would have been easier, cheaper and had less problems if we had stuck w the competition.
missing key features. most notably, there is no way to create bills on qb for ios. this is a major feature that is just not available without a desktop. i can‚Äôt even use a mobile browser to login because the web gui gets cut off when entering a bill, even in landscape mode on an ipad.
bookkeeping on the go. i own a small tax and accounting firm and this app has done wonders for customer service! being able to give my clients real time information from anywhere at anytime is a huge plus!
great small business tool. excellent on a laptop, doesn't handle banks with authentication dongles very well, mobile app doesn't handle them at all. can't do payroll from mobile. receipt tracking is easy and works well. reports and snap shots handy.
limited functionality, issues signing on, given up.... i have tried to use the app for sometime but find the functionality limited and not sufficient to be practical. in recent weeks i have had an issue switching clients which support has been unable to resolve. i am deleting the app & will use the web version.
app doesn‚Äôt recognize credentials. this app worked well for me until the most recent update. now i cant login, says can‚Äôt find the account with this emailpassword. this is very annoying since i travel frequently without a laptop. now i‚Äôve lost the ability to access my accounts via the app.
very poor support and feature. features are basic and they won‚Äôt let you unlock the others with poor support. don‚Äôt use
one thing missing.... this app is super convenient for managing our business on the go. but i can't see a way to create an iphone contact from within the customer details screen. if that feature was added this app would be perfect!!
lost a key feature!!!üò°. update is great except they took away the option when creating a new customer to use a contacts info that's on the device.
disappointed. although it loaded up ok, it didn't refresh my data that i had added online. i emailed support who are supposed to reply in 24 hrs but never heard anything. so unless they get this sorted it's going to be deleted.
solved my invoicing problems. now i can invoice quickly from anywhere. then track and record payments. very simple yet powerful. love the mobility.
terrible app. half the time i can not download my banking info, i can not do invoices. it‚Äôs junk for what you have to pay for it. i‚Äôm finding something new.
great app but.... i love the app; works great for invoices and customer information on the go... however it would be nice if i could get more detailed reports and accounting information on it too... that's my only real complaint but you can still use a computer for that  miss those reports when i'm away from it though.
great for on the go. for a quick check on the p&l or to see an invoice it's great. i would like it more if i could generate purchase orders from it on the road. all in all it's a great little tool.
great app. it is what it is. it an app. it won't have all the features of a computer and you should not expect it to. does exactly what i need it to in the field.
intuit keeps working it but stumbles on occasion. i've been a qbo user for over 4 years now and run my whole oneman business on it. each app version is a bit better than the last and they do fix bugs when notified. i continue to be happy to see intuit continue to improve the app and the web interface. the blanking of bank account data in the dashboard appears to be fixed in v5.3.
love quickbooks. this is the best accounting software there is. quickbooks makes my life so much easier and running my business is so much smoother with the available accounting options!
brilliant app with loads of features!. so easy to use. so easy to learn. instant bank feeds. invite your accountant & bookkeeper & other users. so much support from intuit & the australian team. what's not to like? intuit have put together a great product for the small to medium business owner. thoroughly recommend this product.
user friendly. love how easy it is to invoice clients
can‚Äôt use properly  soooo slow. i can‚Äôt use qbo app properly, the application is so slow, unable to load my data on my mobile (wifi lte network)
works great. works great for my small business. not sure why there are bad reviews, qbo keeps up with my customers information, invoices, and estimates. very easy to use. now on this last update, i did have to uninstall and reinstall on my andriod phone, but within 5 minutes i was back up and running.
not sure yet. too early to rate this app. only second time me using it. ill check back in a couple of months with a more thought out opinion.
excelente. muy buena aplicaci√≥n. llevo varios a√±os utiliz√°ndola.
qbo user. can't say i'm impressed. sure, it has your company info in it. but the most important functionality for a mobile user is time tracking. but there is no way to enter time on the run, in this app, that i can see.
touch id. can we get touch id support to replace the pin?! otherwise very good product.
does not support accounting functions. quickooks is first and foremost an accounting application. this app does not provide for reviewing financial statements, reviewing expense categories (ie cost of goods sold, office expense, etc) and does not allow correction of mis applied expense items. from an accounting and control viewpoint, i think it is almost useless
great app & program  must improve search engine. fantastic program with brilliant features. it does need some urgent fixes. one being to be able to search through an account such as cash sales and be able to find a name, address or phone number.
convenient. moving to quickbooks online plus has been a great move. there was a small learning curve but it is very stable and now we're very happy that we made the change. the best part is using the app on my iphone
easy to use, innovative and mobile friendly. we have been using qb at australiance.com for almost a year and i would not go back to my previous accounting software. the interface with paypal works well and save heaps of time for our online sales. it s easy to create expenses (e.g. business lunches etc), quotes or invoices on the go with the app + always know your bank account position as it interfaces directly with it.
crashes a ton. this is a great app for bookkeeping for my business, but it crashes almost daily on my iphone. please get better engineers for the functionality of this app!! so frustrating when i‚Äôm in the middle of printing invoices and the app crashes! how am i supposed to conduct business that way!?!
great app. the only thing this app is missing is being able to generate reports. give me that and i'd gladly pay a few bucks for this wonderful tool. saves me a lot of time
happy customer. i love this app.can do my invoices everywhere on my mobile or tablet.üòÉüòÉüòÉ
best accounting app. perfect for any small business. never had any problem, never crashes. only need more invoicing templates.
rubbish. app crash every second
amazing. all i can say is i used quick books desktop version older version, the online is amazing and the availability of this app and the notifications keeps me up to date on every aspect of my businesses
old version was better. the functionality of being able to invoice on the go is great but the reports were much better in the old version. used to be able to easily click who owes me and who i owe. wish this had the company snapshot report as a report option.
great for small business owners.. awesome app. very convenient and keeps the finances and work orders organized. takes some trial and error but well worth the effort to learn this system. you tube has many instructional videos on how to expedite learning this program. price is reasonable for what you get. don't hesitate to get it. if anything you will learn something.
app. best account app
not as quick as desktop. this is a good start for working while mobile, but needs a lot more work to compete with the desktop version. expense entries made in webpage are not showing in the expenses in the ios app. they show in the bank account. this looks like a glitch or compatibility issue. tricky to work with, due to not having consistent features (webpage and app). hope this improves, as this is very useful.
my expectations of quick books.. i would expect the quick books would gave been able to give me a complete overview of my accounts and businesses. e.g. i can't find anywhere in the program where i can print my company's balance sheet or my company's profit and loss accounts, to name a few. why is this so?
now i can‚Äôt update banking feed.. all of a sudden i‚Äôm getting error 9999 when i tried to update banking feed.
almost right. love the quickbooks online app. use it on both my iphone and ipadvery easy to generate quotes onsite. just wish it allowed me to do purchase orders!
it gets even easier. i was horrified when i heard tax going digital but quickly got the hang of quick books and amazed it even tries to match things . brilliant
not reliable on weekends or holidays. times when i have to work on weekends or holidays i have the most issues logging in and being able to invoice customers. there is also times when i can‚Äôt login during the week, i‚Äôm guessing due to quickbooks working on servers! wish i could install as a program on my tablet instead of a app or still be able to use offline to print an invoice and receipt
works but needs work. for the most part the product works, but has many errors and sometimes says there are errors but they are never fixed, i run the lasted ios on an iphone 6 and still have many problems
doesn‚Äôt have my bank. doesn‚Äôt have major banks in my country so can‚Äôt use it.
fix finally now i can get back to work.. this version fixed the errors from the last update. glad it working again. quickbooks has been good except the last update. this one fixed the issue. we us this app for our onsite business and it's great. several times i would send an invoice to the customer when i'm leaving their home and before i get to the next job it's already paid. update. does not work again. :(
not pleased. for one i still can't redownload the app after i accidentally deleted it. it's been months. i hit the cloud button and it does nothing. i also put an estimate in and the phone didn't save it. when i checked desktop it was saved 6x because i kept trying to do it on the phone. the app has many glitches but it is helpful when i'm not by a computer but u cannot rely solely on the app.
user. good app but needs more features
can't tap anything when looking at an individual transaction. banking > new transactions > view transaction let's you see what quickbooks added but doesn't let you edit anything.
harry. after upgrading to this version i‚Äôm not able to sign on using the mobile app!! major set back when on the road and need to write an invoice!!
awesome app. feature rich and also user friendly
great app. fantastic app. does everything i need to run my business on the go.
good for on the go. good for on the o, definitely not the same as on the desktop, but pretty good app for most things you need to do quickly
very beneficial app. this is a very beneficial app. it does not replace the pc version but is an excellent aid. it's helpful to send invoices on the go or at the end of a service call. the sooner the customer gets invoice the more chance i have of getting paid. it is a very good aid!
great. very user friendly
annoying but useful. 1. there is no dashboard 2. have to reenter your password every couple of days 3. the only report you can view is p&l. no other reports are available (e.g. ageing, unpaid invoices, customer unpaid, etc.)
great app. it seems to work well! i would suggest it, you can easily go from a laptop to ipad to iphone...
horrible and near useless. often doesn't sync properly with online version, customers and invoices disappear, crashes often. basically... find another solution because this one will only drive you insane.
not great, but no other options on phoneipad. this is terribly buggy software. intuit is not on the ball with development. enter a transaction or invoice on this app, then find it not entered on quickbooks online. won't sync. menus don't work or show on the ipad or iphone. called intuit and they said it's still a young app and they're working on it. i have little faith. hope this all gets fixed.
very good. one of the best way to do estimate and invoices highly recommended
best quickbooks i have used.. this app does everything for your business it's quick it's easy and fast so i recommend this to anybody
basic business. although it does have obvious business needs covered. it doesn't offer the next step in organization. without the ability to create work orders, or track services performed. it remains a minuscule part of my daily business. it really doesn't have anything that separates itself from other simple invoicing programs or applications. it's cloud based convenience remains the reason for my usage.
i'm super impressed. i'm really impressed by this app for both iphone and ipad. i just started using quickbooks online and it was pretty cool to see that the app allows most of the same functionality as the online mac application. i haven't yet found a critical limitation, although i suspect there are some. moreover, with an online subscription, this app is free.
excellent piece of kit. i've held back from making a review as the requests for a review before really using an app seems pointless. i have now used quickbooks for around five months and to be honest i now could not imagine working without it. it is easy to use, clear and without doubt a high quality product. first class and highly recommended.
instant customer service üëå. great app for small to mid size business. phenomenal integration from windows 10. so far so good. thanks.
"not there yet. out of the three versions of qbo, the ipad version here is definitely the weakest. in design terms it shows very little similarity to the osx version, lacking much functionality as it does. it is still impossible to switch between my two company accounts. logging out and then reentering my long secure password is an unnecessary pain. this could and indeed should be so much better. in english parlance, intuit need a ""kick up the backside""."
great. this app helps my small business tremendously. very easy to navigate, enter and retrieve data. very affordable.
app has gone downhill since update. youve just done an update and hardly anything works. buttons are unresponsive and crashes! sort it out
great tool. awesome app, so far so good
not pleased. i put the qb online app on my new ipad thinking i wouldn't have to lug my laptop around the country anymore.... it does not have the functionality or settings i need. i cannot input bills from other contractors on the mobile app! they have a loooong way to go... it‚Äôs still clunky and like the cd desktop versions severely mentally disabled cousin. lame........
crashing. app keeps crashing every time i click on it!
mr. brilliant accountancy software,simple to use in the office or on the go.
excellent. wonderful app to use. very handy when working out in the field. easy to get on the phone with a live person for any and all questions.
greatly improved!. we have been using intuit products for over 15 years and we are impressed with new quickbooks online service. only thing is i wish billing solutions worked with it or similar way to use an invoice mailing service.
best bookkeeping app. it has everything you need to make your small business life easy & hassle free!
waste of space. all we want to do is access quick books online via our ipads. this app is worthless. as my business continues to grow we will obviously be looking for a software provider that listens to clients instead of putting out disappointments like this. save the space on your ipad and don't bother.
great invoicing and management tool. awesome tool to keep your small business running at its best. highly automated, making it very easy to work with.
roland shaw. far from a sorted system so for now not very happy
no american express support. we use american express for expenses and we cannot manage these transactions within the app. not even see them. the app tells me to view quickbooks online in a web browser to manage amex transactions. this makes this app very useless.
not available?. i need this app to work with my uk quickbooks account that handles multiple currencies. the iphone app is at least functional but lacking many features.
awful!. this latest update is awful! i have had nothing but problems saving notes and attachments. plus it looks really weird! i like the previous version much better, it actually worked! thanks for messing up a perfectly good product!
not bad. pretty nice app. went from desktop manufacturing to quickbooks online. i like having access to my books while at craft fairs and being able to use different devices. still needs some work  it's been weeks and my gopayment account is still not linked and now find out the online doesn't acceptrecognize the chip reader. square app is more robust and may use that instead. also would be helpful to have a mileage tracker.
great app. makes life easy. one addition will make it perfect. add journal entry to the app.
great accounting software. after using qb software for many years, i switched to qb online as a happy customer. i advise qb online especially if you are in wholesale trading.
horrible app. you can‚Äôt add time activity. this has to be the stupidest design i‚Äôve ever seen. you‚Äôre in the field and the most common use would be to add billable time. i‚Äôm about to switch to another provided if they don‚Äôt get their act together.
very easy to use, and company responds to queries and requests. i have used this app for 4 months now and find it is constantly improving and great to use
estimate layout. i like the way the app works, i have problems when i need to include a lot of info on the estimates. when i send it it leaves the first page blank and cuts of some of the info on the second page. overall great though!
quickbooks app. it has all the tools i need and is very convenient
amazing app!!!. this is the most powerful and helpful app to manage a company, it it easy and friendly!!
solid app. the app works well with the online service and gives access to the basics so while out of the office you can still stay up on your business. would like to see the ability to add and see bills through the app instead of only expenses.
simply superb!. quick books app really took my accounting overview in a single glance. thanks qb team for amazing ui
terrible support  avoid. terrible, terrible support. continual promises of call backs from customer support agents on live chat never happen because the bugs you find are too hard. open tickets for bugs never get resolved. you ask for a supervisor or manager and you have to email the person you‚Äôre complaining about?! get told that because of system bugs you have to manually delete the key back in multiple entries. you‚Äôll be left at year end with books that don‚Äôt balance like me. avoid!
owner. love this app work great.
great app would be useful to do bills on it though. reminder email doesn't work on app
"great app. excellent app that integrates with lots of other apps i use. it has saved me many hours doing my accounts. (game changer for sure!)  i just wish i could change the wording ""shipping address"" to ""property address"" but maybe in time"
need improvement asap. need to approve the app asap due to many loss of customers. disappointed of the high price.
if only i could run payroll. the only thing the app is missing is the ability to run payroll from the app. if it had payroll it would be a 5 star app rating.
life saver. apart from the fact i have to input my password every time, this app is a great compliment to the version i use on my laptop. so easy to use, can invoice on the spot. very happy.
broken. i sign in and all it does is take me to a screen that says it isn't quick books mac. the only buttons on the screen either take me to a webpage saying the app isn't quick books for mac or takes me back to sign in.
good app. this app is a good. we like it on ipad and iphone too. thanks qb!
latest update crashing on iphone 7. app crashes 2sec after being turned on on iphone7. restarted phone, no luck
app is almost useless for me.. the only reason i upgraded to quickbooks on line was so that i could do estimates and invoicing on site. this app will allow me to do an estimate but will not let me do a partial invoice. if i can‚Äôt do a partial invoice on the app it‚Äôs simply a waste of time for my small fencing business.
it's broke :(. wonderful app, latest update has caused many issues, including signing in with fingerprint or app code. have to do a full sign in each time with email and loooooong password. hope they can fix soon! üò©üòñüò§
so easy. this app is user friendly and intuitive. i like being able to see the reports and add attachments to expenses. highly recommended for small businesses owners.
bookkeeper 60. excellent app. would be 5 stars but still has bugs...most notably touch id login.
outstanding app!. owning a small business has enough headaches as it is. with quickbooks, estimating and invoicing projects and services couldn't be easier! everything is streamline! here's a look inside my day to day as a landscaper using quickbooks: initial client meeting> estimate delivered before i leave the property.. bam! they call back that night or the next day and we have the job. after we finish the project, turn that estimate into an invoice on site.. bam! paid! $$ in the bank!
beautiful, so simple.. really great app.
"about 710. not bad but not good. the app keeps requiring updates if used on apple products. not an issue but the updates never appear. quickbooks blames apple and apple blame quickbooks. we ""updated to the cloud version"" from a pcm based quickbooks. so far we are very very disappointed."
convenience is nice. nice to be able to access clients remotely and get most information. would be nice to have full functionality in app. some functions are slow going from screen to screen.
improving. intuit continues to refine the app. it will really shine when they incorporate a robust pos system that shares items across their own platforms.
good app, but could be better. the app is good but could be better with more functionality. for example not being able to add 'bills' but you can add 'expenses' a small change but would make the app much better.
new clients. too cumbersome to input data. also confusing fields in line item, should be able to template common jobs tasks more easily. i find i have to start a new line item for every new client although doing the very same task
not good support. the app is ok, but if you require support, it is not there.
the worst customer service ever. don‚Äôt waist your time. trust my word
pointless. useless app. can‚Äôt even see any supplier invoices etc. what is the point of having the app if you can‚Äôt work fully on the go!?
pretty good when it works. very helpful when it works. very useless when it crashes and won't stay running.
n entendi nd. tenho 17 anos, nao entendi nd, sou burra ou esse app √© ruim? talvez a primeira op√ß√£o, mas de qq forma n gostei
not happy any longer!. having issues logging in every single time now, very frustrating and not happy at all. always asking for finger print, and when typing in my password, it takes about 5 attempts before it‚Äôll login to my company info. also having a constant lag when trying to inputsubmit any items to customers. this is extremely upsetting when trying to submit invoices before a deadline.
brilliant. i love the qb app. can invoice on the job. wish i'd used it sooner.
app isn‚Äôt working now. please advise. it has stopped working. i click on the app and it automatically closes. new iphone today should work unless not compatible with ios13.
quickbooks slow and hard to work. hard to understand and work. cannot pay on invoices on phone but can on computer. system is slow. give me the old system any day
great app. the quickbooks application allows me to quickly see my bank accounts, profit and loss statements, balance sheet, invoices etc.
so far so good.... use on a 3rd gen ipad. payroll function works great. no crashes so far. would recommend.
fantastic!. i love this app. it works really well, and makes it easy for me to stay ontop of invoicing my customers.
bens k9 obedience training. i have a small business. quick book is ideal for records not have to spend a lot of time balancing books. quick book does it for you. every day you know where you stand profit and loss etc
gets the job done. very helpful app. works well. no issues that i have experienced.
great, clean app. although it's yet another expense for your business, it's well worth every cent. more of an investment for us and we use it for four different companies (yes four times the subscription fee). regardless, it will manage your company's finances as they should be. leaving you with less hassle and worries about your accounts and more time to focus on more important entrepreneurial things.
very nice!. i love have this power in my phone! i can email invoices or print them out, all on my phone! this app is easy to learn and soooooo fast when you get used to it. there was a lot of thinking when they designed this app, wow
love it. love the app, really intuitive!!! and great customer service!!!
very much helpful. thanks quickbooks!!! your the best!!! only suggestion is hopefully i can also view on mobile app the quantity on hand of my products... thanks for making it easy for me to manange my inventory!! i love quickbooks i use this on my 3 branches üòäüòäüòä
dashboard is broken. app needs work.. the app dashboard appears to throw up numbers completely unrelated to reality and almost always reports inability to retrieve all data. the web version, on the other hand, works fine. it seems not much attention has been put into app development. disappointing.
couldn't ask for more!. everything you need, intuitive and great access with mobile apps!
software de gest√£o. excelente e r√°pido! me ajuda muito! parab√©ns! pequenas coisas precisam de ajuste mas que n√£o atrapalham em nada. podem usar!
quickbooks. i love this awesome app! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòç
tricked. had to provide all my email and phone information before being told it was a free trial, felt tricked, if you want to save money doing your books you don't want to pay for an app to help you, just learn to do it yourself for free
warning: don't update to ios9.. force closes when getting signatures. software is not updated and ready for new update.
pretty good. i've been using qb for years to run my small auto repair business. the latest qbo and phone app are pretty good. like the interface. easy to use. only complaint is if i have no internet connection i'm dead in the water. being mobile is occasionally an issue.
keep crashing. after last update june 12 2019 keep crashing. new update came just an hour ago still same crash???!!!doesn‚Äôt launch the app. please fix asap pleasseeee
one best app for accounting. one of best app for accounting
quickbooks is fantastic!. this app is fantastic what a wonderful job they have done if you minor glitches in the expense area making expenses billable on ipad or iphone is broken otherwise fantastic app
it's glitchy!. although it fulfills the need of having the ability to create estimates on the spot and resend invoices quickly, it has glitches which are frustrating. on occasion it stalls and goes out of the app requiring you to log on several times and even restart your phone before be able to access the app.
not happy. when i first got the app i fell in love i had problems with the desktop version , with the bank option on the online version which you removed i was able to log in my transactions very quickly , i would appreciate it if you would please bring back the bank option in the menu asap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
inapp purchase, but not stated in advance. rt
no more ios 8 support. disappointed that app developers are dropping ios8 support. not everyone upgrades the second apple comes out with a new ios
very good for any kind of business!. quickbooks is great app for managing the everyday finances. it's very fast to send invoices, with this app all income and expenses are simple and quick.
great app. only thing i don‚Äôt like is if you accidentally delete an invoice you can never get that invoice number back and it‚Äôs now been voided. that needs to be fixed so it can be adjusted or recovered. none the less it‚Äôs a great app. won‚Äôt ever connect my bank info none the less because that‚Äôs how you get audited for nothing.
very user easy. this app is great. very user friendly!
mr smith. electrical contractor. early days yet but feels great especially linking bank to invoices and been able to see exactly what is going on in my business. so far a big thumbs up .
awesome app. this is a brilliant app. i have all my invoices and expenses at my fingertips. very easy to use and synchs perfectly with qbo on my mac. keeps me on track with daily reminders of overdue invoices. no one gets away with not paying me now.
great stuff. for me, this app is perfect. as a freelance travel writer i can take a snap shot of my expenses and update my accounts on the road. the only problem i have is that you cannot access the app when you have no coverage so i cannot work offline.
not for the ipad or iphone. the app does not support stp... have to access using web browser on ipad iphone . so don‚Äôt buy the app if you want to use it for stp. browser access using an ipad pro , you won‚Äôt be able to scroll down or access command icons because they are beyond the margins of the ipad screen. can‚Äôt finish inputting categories because the screens won‚Äôt scroll at all
amazing app. so great to use! still missing few features but gets the job done
plenty to be desired. there are options such as making expenses billable is not available. previously had issues with adjusting tax in the app and the support team told me to use the web based version. what's the point in having an app with features when the support team just tells you use the web version.
too many glitches. i love quickbooks and i love that they have an app but there are a lot of glitches in the performance. the screen goes blurry, logs you completely out of the system inconveniently, customer list is unlined with the screen, there are more but minor.
it gets the job done. it‚Äôs not a bad app. i can‚Äôt find anything that will do everything i want & the problem with this is that i can‚Äôt fully customize my estimateinvoice forms. they have preset forms that you can play with a little, but not enough for my satisfaction.
online quickbooks. quickbooks online is so different from the regular quickbooks. it will require a new learning curve to use it. hard to print payroll checks and regular checks reliably. it is handy to have things online, but it looks like we are a few generations away from it working well.
no support from quickbooks is brutal. there's no support options provided from quickbooks directly. that's a very poor customer experience, especially when paying $100s per year for this platform. the online community is somewhat helpful, but you're relying on contributions from other random users being accurate, which they may not be. please step up, quickbooks.
small business owner. i have been skeptical about leaving all my business information in an external server, thinking that one day, the software seller is not longer in business. intuit has given me that confidence and now i am very excited with services i have received so far. the program is easy to set up and easy to use. very friendly menus. you can use as many functions you wish. is good even for those who have little experience keeping track of business.
scott. i find the app to be a great addition to the desktop version. having access to all invoices and customers through my phone is excellent.
works great for me!. i love this app! it is nice to be able to create invoices, accept payments, and email invoices on the spot. no more waiting to get back to my computer for data entry.
great stable app that keeps getting better and better!. gives me access to everything i want but i'm on the go or just don't want to pick up the computer or tablet.
changed our business. from the first version of this app with the online version of quickbooks, this has changed our business. no more scribbled notes on sticky paper or back of a student roster. sales are done immediately and nothing is lost or forgotten. my only request is to please add time tracking fit our instructors into the app, then it would be perfect!
great app. easy to use. love the 4 digit log in option.
great but could use a little more. overall pretty great. clean easy to do basic tasks, would love access to a few more advanced features...but overall it's a great app. the app is stable, love the fingerpint login (even though it's still a little buggy at time of writing the review), it's clean & easy to read, good navigation. overall i'm very happy with it!
i love quickbooks online. i love quickbooks online & my accountant does also. this app is really good for doing your expenses on but as far as invoicing i still do it on the computer. it's very handy for a small business. the fact you can enter an expense, take a picture of the receipt & go on your merry way. i'm sold.

overly complicated for sole prop. this app is useless for simple small business money in money out, it shouldn‚Äôt be this hard and definitely not worth the fight
efficace. je suis seul dans mon entreprise et ce service me permet de cr√©er et consulter n‚Äôimporte o√π mes factures et autres √©l√©ments. l‚Äôinterface smartphone est g√©niale en ce qui me concerne.
great app. love that i can get estimates approved right on my phone!
be careful. when printing invoices from the app it has a tendency to eliminate parts of the billing address. scary.
super easy. great app and accounts program  easy to use after a small amount of training. so far i haven‚Äôt come across any of those annoying bugs you get in other accounts apps
brilliant!. easy to use, matches payments received and ties them off with your invoices, easy to see profit and expenses for each month. well worth the monthly payment, my books have never been so easy to keep!
unhappy v18.12. as of version 18.2 i can no longer ‚Äúswitch company‚Äù. looks like the developers broke a really great app.
app crashing in ios 13. please note that the app is crashes in ios 13. have not been able to open it sine updating. otherwise it is a fantastic application.
it was barely ok to start with!. i had used quickbooks for several years and then went to the online version. i liked the features it had, but really didn‚Äôt like the 600.00 a year fee. for the most part it worked, but never all of the time. then when they raised the subscription price to 720.00 a year, that was it. i said good bye and found another program. no regrets!
keeps crashing. i can't do anything with the app. every time i try to open it, it closes out about 5 seconds later. worked great until the last update.
best program.. essential for any business.
great. i haven't had any trouble with quick books. it's easy to create customers and vendors. i am able to quickly submit expensessales transactions into the app and emailing customer receipts is a snap. it gives my company a professional edge and my account is going to be a happy camper!
no refund and help support was clueless.. called twice no one could help me and both phone numbers proved useless. billing support was not helpful. could not even locate my ipad online subscription thru itunes. waste of time and money in my experience.
as large a company as intuit is, where's the support?. i can't imagine that as large of a company as intuitquickbooks is that they can't fix these constant issues with this app. it's been working ok until this last update. i have to physically go to the help section and hit the refresh button for sales receipts to show received after i enter them. and as everyone else has pointed out, touchid is no longer working.
update ruined a great small business tool. quickbooks use to be an awesome tool to let us send invoices after a job is completed on the spot. it also allowed a user to edit payment information anywhere via the mobile app. this is now all gone thanks to the new update. if it is not fixed soon, we are looking into transferring our accounts to another system.
newest update is nothing but problems. can no longer update estimates. freezes and have to close app. also cannot see new estimates fellow employees have created. app ran perfectly prior to the update. intuit needs to launch new update asap or they are losing my business.
excellent customer support. not only is this an awesome product, but the customer support is top of the line. every tech i've spoken to is knowledgeable and professional. data integrity is very high. definitely recommend.
good but needs more. i love this app and use it every day  it has taken me from doing my accounts once a year and being ridiculously late with invoicing, to on the spot invoicing and totally up to date with everything ... except receiving payments
"missing a couple things. would be even better if the mobile app allowed you to enter the ""ship time"" and ""ship date"" and if the ""reports"" could be viewed on the app could be more full service"
qb has revolutionized business accounting. i have been using qb online since 2011 and can honestly say that it has delivered an exceptionally easy and effortless business accounting solution. one touch payroll and the ease of ap and ar management is awesome. i do all the accounting for my startup and i rely on qb to make it all possible. qb is continuously improving both the desktop and mobile apps to make my life easier. thanks doyle heisler founder wanamaker corp
ceo. quickbooks has a great feature that you can upload the receipt through camera! however, the camera should be smart enough to pick up information on the receipt, such as date, vendor name, amount, etc.... that will be intuitive!!
great app. love the app. been using for years and have never had an issue
excellent app. keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
outstanding accounting software. perfect for sme's. enter bills and invoices on the go including taking photos of your receipts and signatures for invoices. absolutely outstanding accounts package, i couldn't recommend it more, well done intuit!
a great improvement over the mac desktop version. it saves me tons of time that i used to spend recording payments, expenses and running reports. client payments are easily paid via credit card by the client and automatically applied to the invoice. it has simplified my accounting.
aaaamazing. i run a mobile and in home boutique and this app has been a life saver! i'm so happy with it!
poor. this app makes very poor use of the screen real estate of phablet style phones and even worse on ipads. they also removed the comma from the keyboard, so adding additional email addresses to a customer is impossible. generally a poor design, this app is years behind where i should be.
three years using qbo. very dissatisfied.. bugs and more bugs. slow and clunky functionality. bait and switch pricing. no way to communicate effectively with qbo as they are pro forma all about feedback and customer service however the poor souls tasked with providing it have no two way communication with the people who actually code this bug ridden system. i am actively looking for other solutions that provide ipad and iphone data entry.
good but too many bug with ios. after the good first impression, using daily is little bit frustrating. example: problems with input dates and items. sometime the calendar doesn't open etc.
bad program. won't send estimates and invoices. buisness cash flow has been screwed up.
brockton driving school. great app, keeps my business manageable on the go.
business management made easy.... quickbooks has taken the pain and most of the time out of bookkeeping for my photography business. it lets me spend my time working with customers and get invoices out promptly to get paid!
great functionality. great app! great way to keep up with receipts on the go.
quicbooks is just plain lame. absolutely ridiculous how one cannot add extra fields in invoicing. support is full of excuses claiming things will be fixed and never goes anywhere. then got message that everything from qbse would have to be migrated to their more comprehensive (read expensive) package... basically just a trap.
what did you do with the functionality?. there is nothing to work with here. qbo has gone from bad to worse. what happened to the 'almost desktop version' i saw in beta?
damn that update!!. quickbooks is great. we've transitioned over from sage and it is so much quicker and easier. estimating and invoicing a breeze. but..... ever since the last update, it makes you sign in to your account everytime you open the app which is incredibly frustrating as it takes some time to load your company info etc. usually, touch id and you're in and ready to go. please please please sort this out asap and you'll be perfect again!
don‚Äôt update to ios 13 if you want this to work. there a so many bugs with this app now that ios version 13 has been released. you can‚Äôt even enter an expense now without an error popping up that you need to create a template. quickbooks online support has been no help. they advised i use the browser on my phone. what‚Äôs the point of the app then? test test test folks.
mr. brilliant accountancy software,simple to use in the office or on the go.
great app. quick books has come a long way this app it's great love it
great app. i don't understand what some people are complaining about it. this app works great. thank you
well done.. on my wish list is an interface to my phone contact list and a direct link to paypal.
won't sign in, incorrect subscription error.. like the title says, can't login tells me my subscription may have expired. i can log in through website easily.
sweet & sour. been using for a month or so, very pleased on being able to do my bookkeeping on the go..... but!! disappointed on not being able to have balances on checking or savings accounts unless you get back to a computer. please add this feature.
makes it easy. i love the easy to use format and more professional looking invoices and estimates. and the format saves me a lot of time filling out forms. before i was hand writing the estimate, scanning and then emailing from my computer at home. qb does all that from my phone. it works very well for my small business.
this app having more issues reload if you have an issue.. invoice not showing up. i don't think it is syncing correctly with quickbooks online that is going to be an issue when i loose money and or re invoice my customer. :( please fix this. note reloading app cause it to fix these issue. intuit needs a reload company button.
doesn't work for ipad. this app doesn't even load my company info. it keeps returning error trying to load company info. i have contacted quickbooks a number of times and all they say is they are working on the issue and to use a web browser version in the mean time. i have seen about 4 updates released and not one of them has fixed this issue. when will this be fixed?
awesome. it saves me so much time. great to keep up with my business accounting. mostly simple to use. some features require a bit of basic accounting knowledge.
great app. the app takes a bit to get used to but once you've played with it a bit it's very simple to navigate, update bank transactions and so on
limited features in the app. the app has extremely limited features as compared to web cant send customer statements or edit recurring transactions or match partially paid invoices.
quicbooks is just plain lame. absolutely ridiculous how one cannot add extra fields in invoicing. support is full of excuses claiming things will be fixed and never goes anywhere. then got message that everything from qbse would have to be migrated to their more comprehensive (read expensive) package... basically just a trap.
doesn't work on ios. unable to login. this is a known issue with qb and ios9. support states it is indefinitely not working. guess they don't have anyone capable of writing code. intuit is a real company, right? embarrassing.
ok. app ok
fix the receipt picture big please. on the past several months i've had to take every receipt image twice before it shows up in the app. i actually lost several receipts (because i didn't realize that the first image was not uploading) before even realizing this was an issue. otherwise, this has been a great app for my purpose. i'll bump this to a 5 star if that issues gets resolved.
missing data on iphone and ipad. i have an issues where invoices are missing for some customer on both iphone and ipad. the show up absolutely fine on the web. i can see the payments but get the error when i open the payment qbm.error.00500000.reason.iphone. please fix asap
great app. i travel constantly and this app allows me to keep up with my bookkeeping wherever i am
awesome. looking forward to seeing what's next!. there's times when i get fuel and the gas pump printer is out of paper. i pull out my phone, snap a picture of the purchase and expense it. brilliant. i would like to itouch login option. it's not to cool punching in your password while shivering. thanks qbo.
mr parsons. love it!! only thing is that i cant connect my bank account, i use ‚Äúcounting up‚Äù if this could be corrected that would be great
not the best. i have tried to like qb but don't find it as user friendly as others. i have used xero and find this better but expensive. i have also tried invoice2go and was really impressed. only using qb because of accountant and that i am too tight to pay for xero.
paid for subscription but no access. apple says they sent the payment quickbooks says they never received it.... revolving door with neither party willing to help. pay directly through quickbooks if your going to buy.
no american express support. we use american express for expenses and we cannot manage these transactions within the app. not even see them. the app tells me to view quickbooks online in a web browser to manage amex transactions. this makes this app very useless.
don‚Äôt use this with an ipad.. bought this app and was unable to get it to work with an ipad. 4 hours on the phone with this company and still no success. they charged me and told me to get my money back through apple. there is an open known problem being worked on their end but user‚Äôs beware. you won‚Äôt find out until you‚Äôve paid.
easy to use once set up!!. works great
rubbish. absolutely rubbish since the last update . keeps crashing on iphone xr. screen message = app needs to close due to critical updates. happens 2030 x times a day when trying to set up an invoice estimate etc. test your updates before release you them, you idiots!
bad update. won't work at all after i updated today.
love it!. qb is stunningly simple yet superbly sufficient to handle our business needs for invoicing clients, reporting ar and preparing us for yearend taxes. the mobil app is equally impressive!
love it so easy on the go. great support of an easily understood ap! perfect for my on road small horse business thanks
needs a lot of improvement. missing a lot of features and information available with the web browser connection. can't see vendor history. can't sort how inboxes etc are listed. a few other issues. freezes often. in the middle of invoice entry, the system bounced me out for some reason, while not saving the work i had entered to date. did that twice. before i closed out and went to pc web connection. i love the possibility this app offers, development need to fix and enhance
horrible tech support. they couldn't even transfer my desktop file to quickbooks online. after one month they called me at 8pm to say it can't be done.
pathetic on ipad. i don‚Äôt know why intuit bother to have an ipad app. it never works, has less functionality than a browser. the latest update tells you your account doesnt exist, the exact same log in as a browser. someone in the development department is being paid far too much for a substandard product. avoid the app like the plague
good start. i wish i could log my time on the app. i suppose i have to pay extra for that. big disappointment.
paid app. app costs 8.99 a month
bad update. used to work good until last update now when i open the app is says downloading company data, gets stuck there for ages. if it finally loads, there are no customer invoices, just payments. tried deleting the app and reinstalling but does the same thing. the pc app works fine and my employees have samsung phones and they haven't complained of any issues may just be an iphone app problem.
help. there doesn't seem to be a way to tie in purchases on to a invoice to charge specific customers. when you call in for help with the app, customer service does not have access to see what you're looking at.
it's great. enjoy this app
mr. doesn't work on ipad pro or iphone. it says my subscription has expired. i have had it for several years and it still works on macbook but on ios it thinks i am on a free trial until 13th april but still locks me out saying i need to update my subscription. it is useless to me if it won,t work on ipad because i photograph all my receipts into the app. will cancel subscription if it doesn't work soon.
not bad. convenient app. not as functional as quickbooks online, but it adds to its subscription's value.
quickbooks renew account??. renewed my subscription for a year and i'm still locked out, every time i log in it keeps telling me to subscribe for 1 month i tried to go that way and it asked if i wanted to change my current year subscription? makes no sense.. wish some (tech support or program owner) fixes it i'm about to cancel it all..... wy small business owner
good app. haven't had a problem with this app.
ceo of gd2k. this is a really good app it has help our business in so many ways. it help boost our profit margin we have been able to close deals, and make invoices right on the spot. i recommend this for a lot of different business with quickbooks online.
great app!. very userfriendly and convenient. great for people who are needing to create invoices and estimates and track expenses. the iphone app is fantastic!
app crashes. this app crashes or cannot save my data on every entry i make. horrible app!!
good but this app needs to have a debit option when adding expenses. also i am really frustrated at this moment, because your app keeps crashing on my ipad. if theses 2 issues are fixed i would give it 10 stars
unique landscaping. it‚Äôs simple to use and helps to keep up with you‚Äôre accounting, totally recommend it
getting better with every upgrade.. great app. they do lure you with the free use then hit ya with the charges later. i think it's a useful tool in the toolbox.
completely useless for me. i need to receive payment by invoice number like i can do on the desktop and web version. this doesn't allow for that. useless.
gary stanton. this app means i can seem to know what i am doing, it actually works for me. still good!
great updates and really user friendly. all works better than before and integrates brilliantly. makes understanding our financials a doddle!
makes it easy. so glad i decided to go with quickbooks, update daily to keep track of expenses and sales. fantastic for my business.
app has connectivity issues. anytime i log into the app it causes me to have to relink my bank accounts every time. if i stay out of the app everything works appropriately. i can log onto different devices through the browsers without issue but the second i log onto the app on a tablet or phone, it will disconnect my bank accounts.
new update horrible. it's always been glitch but since the new update i can't add products to the estimate and customer service is clue less in how to resolve the issue.
latest rev still buggy. when adding a new customer, cannot import contact info besides names. address email and phone numbers not automatically being added while accessing phone contacts. also receiving consistent home error message of being unable to access company info.
starting with errors. i am just starting my beekeeping business and trying to track expenses. quick books somehow has me making a $164 sale. i can't erase it because it doesn't exist. would love it but can't reconcile the books if random numbers are calculated out of thin air!
we need an update for iphone x. we need an update for iphone x. in addition, we need the function to add cc recipient when sending out quotes or invoices. other than those 2 things, it is good.
dreadful just unusable plus desktop version same. started well. then couldn‚Äôt input expenses on the app. hard and long winded to get support. now cant enter invoices and reciepts on desktop version!! totally pointless package and when you have r pugh troubles running your own business!!!!! think i will go back to my accountant and just dump everything with him each month as the hours this is costing me plus unbelievable stress!!!!
works good. easy to use.. it's really easy to file expenses with this. that's all i really need a mobile accounting app for.
owner. quickbooks online, so far we like everything about except for the fact that it works like crap on an ipad. please come out with an update and patch work soon it's not worth it.
great way to keep up with small business book keeping. in previous years, with my software based quickbooks, i ended up doing most of my neglected books once a year for tax times. with this i do an update on a daily bases and will have do just a little detailing come years end.
excellent program. i am so impressed with this new app, it is very easy to use and very helpful for my construction business. i don't even have to go to the office to make an invoice i can do it right in my truck on my phone and send it. i can check on expenses... it's a breeze and worth the time to get to know this app and online program.
worst ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù process ever!!!!. if you have self employed don‚Äôt even dream of trying to fluidly upgrade to online. they data doesn‚Äôt just migrate over. the tech support people are clueless. one sharing my screen hadn‚Äôt ever even seen what self employed looked like and had no idea how anything worked compared to online. it‚Äôs total frustration.
excellent app!. anything that can please my accountant and help me stay organised gets my vote!
invoice and estimates not saving after last update. you will have to delete app. then reinstall then it will save.
limited features. good app but still too many features missing that require logging in to the website. e.g. vat and paying salaries as expenses.
mixed bag and ball and chain. a great improvement over the years but the system breaks down at the worst times. today(friday) could not access any of the program for 4 hours. no invoices. no purchase orders. yikes!! when it works, it works well.
owner. great mobile app, keeps my company on the move!
trouble with pin log in. love the app, however latest upgrade requires that i type in my password every time i turn on the app, even though pin in set to on. tried turning setting off and on, doesn't help. hopefully you will fix this on next upgrade. pin log does not work.
"about 710. not bad but not good. the app keeps requiring updates if used on apple products. not an issue but the updates never appear. quickbooks blames apple and apple blame quickbooks. we ""updated to the cloud version"" from a pcm based quickbooks. so far we are very very disappointed."
ok but struggles on ipad pro. what the app does it does well but it doesn‚Äôt do payroll as well as some other features. logging in to the website on my ipad pro isn‚Äôt much better.
awesome app!. best way to keep your finances organized!
ok when it works.. this app is ok when it works but if intuit is having issues, they will never admit it and they will leave you hanging for up to a day or more without help! not worth the money.
dan boulton. great bit of kit, works on desktops (chrome a must) and ipads. great to tap into the companies account anywhere, any places. a few problems from the start , but we are flying now. great value for money for both new and old business.
don't bother. been using qb desktop for years. disapointed in the sasmobile version. mobile app is slow and frequently fails to load at all. not much functionality at all besides creating invoices. checking account balances or customer ar is not worth the bother on mobile app. this is an ok solution. i bet there are better options available than qb mobile app.
"confusing and cluttered app. i love that nearly all of the features in the desktop app are here in the mobile app. however the interface, especially the home page, is confusing and cluttered. ""company activity"" is a bit useless as the default page. show me the charts of paidunpaid invoices. i think the developers are tasked with including every single feature and that clouds their design judgement. it's not an easy ask but let's make this app more mobile friendly."
awesome app. easy to use. intuitive. great mobile app.
best accounting software i've tried. this has got to be the most intuitive feature rich reasonably priced cloud computing package for small business i've ever seen. waaay better than myob, such a great little app.
timesheet and expenses. it would be a great app if our employees could access and input timesheets and expenses. maybe one day.
would be better if i could manage payroll on the app. i would love to be able to do up my company‚Äôs payroll on the fly if i‚Äôm out on a job site or on a business trip. please fix this
excellent. i been using quickbooks in various versions since 1996. i upgraded to online in 2015. as i am a working at customers premises, sometimes 15 different a day, the instant invoicing using my iphone saves me having to sit at my office at the end of the day invoicing. another great thing about online is to check any outstanding invoices from customers who request unscheduled visits.
oakes firewood llc. great app! love it! easy and fast to use. good job!
awesome. i have an hvac business and everything in this app is awesome. the invoicing,estimates,collecting payments, emailing invoices or estimates, the whole thing. my wife does the books and she loves this version of quickbooks better than the pro version. i can access it from my ipad or iphone and my wife can access it from her samsung phone. all around great app. you do have to have the quickbooks online version on a computer and it has a monthly fee, but well worth it.
update ruined a great small business tool. quickbooks use to be an awesome tool to let us send invoices after a job is completed on the spot. it also allowed a user to edit payment information anywhere via the mobile app. this is now all gone thanks to the new update. if it is not fixed soon, we are looking into transferring our accounts to another system.
new update. i love the app and it has been great for us for years. however, the new update does not allow a custom date range for reports and when you edit an invoice it gives you a small screen that not everything fits on. please bring back the custom date range and make is so we can see everything on edits.
everything worked great until last update.. can't save invoices. have to login every time using password. payments don't apply to the invoices just to name a few. wish i hadn't updated.
still needs a lot of work. i like the idea of having a mobile app, but it's nearly worthless, since most of what i need to do can only be done on the desktop. i find that i rarely use it  unless i'm out of the office and need to reference something. even then, it's very difficult to find the information i need and sometimes, there's no way to access it. it just doesn't exist on the mobile version.
great app. convenient. quickbooks app is very easy to use and makes tracking expenses quick and easy.
works well!. this app does what i need it to do. i'm an electrical contractor and i'm able to do all the bookkeeping myself with just a little help. i like the ability to make invoices on the job, enter receipts at stores, and view the status of customers. i would suggest this for any small business. i use the basic service ($10mth) and it's well worth it.
don't bother. been using qb desktop for years. disapointed in the sasmobile version. mobile app is slow and frequently fails to load at all. not much functionality at all besides creating invoices. checking account balances or customer ar is not worth the bother on mobile app. this is an ok solution. i bet there are better options available than qb mobile app.
amazing. this app is a life saver! started my own hvac company in march of 2015 and this is the only app i use for keeping track of finances, invoicing, payroll and taxes. it really makes running my business as easy as possible! love it, thanks quickbooks!!
worst service. changed a template i have used for invoices and estimates for 5 years without warning or reason i cannot access the ones i sent even one week ago customer service said i was using a classic template and it's gone and not coming back . makes zero sense it's 2017 get a clue . don't buy don't join charge back!
don‚Äôt update. ever since last update it crashes when i try to run a credit card. was talking with customer support for an hour and all she could say is i understand. when i asked to speak to a manager the line was disconnected
great app. i've been a qb user since the early 90's. the app keeps getting better with greater functionally. i'm confident that all functions will be available on the app in future release. i use this app all day to create estimates and bill customers. it's great.
many bugs. need to fix bugs that cause the app to not follow the regular online access. employees can see things they shouldn't (like business income) and are unable to do things they should like entering customer info and invoices.
easy to use. great app to use
great. great software looking forward to updates
essential sme tackle. intuit recently upped their game quite dramatically with the reworked online interface, which is extremely slick and intuitive (no pun!)... or at least as intuitive as double entry accounting software can be for the layman... if they added the ability to set different product pricing structures for different customers and a decent cash flow projection tool, i reckon i could justifiable give it five stars.
not useful. hard to use. logs out when you switch screens. fields not consistent.
doesn‚Äôt work on ios 13. so many bugs:  can‚Äôt send reminders  can‚Äôt modify invoices ( reaching invoice number limit?)  can‚Äôt send invoices( email is too long? )
excellent app. helpful reports and nice review of recent transactions to make sure operations are in tact.
useful but limited. useful but definitely not as many features as the web version.
no es gratis. al principio lo configuras todo pensando que la puedes usar gratis aunque luego hagas compras en la app, pero no es as√≠. lo configuras todo con tus datos personales y cuando terminas te dicen que debes pagar. y a mi opini√≥n no es barata.
mostly simple app. mostly simple app. only issue is posting payments to invoice within app but online no problem.
accepting transactions is huge. staying on top of qb transactions is always tough. now i can accept anytime i have a few minutes and it isn't a big event. the result is having a more real time and dependable p&l. this is a great app finally. keep the updates coming.
needing improvements after more than a year. the app is good for entering transactions and it does this poorly. you have to perform searches which are cumbersome. despite the fact on mobile i have entered transactions for only five vendors, it shows a list of the vendors with whom have transacted business with the most for the last 15 years. this app only does a fraction of what the full online app can do.
not ipad friendly. although the web based system works pretty well from a desktop or laptop it is very unfriendly on the ipad.
permissions issues. i would rate 4 stars if the app permissions were accurate. whenever adding a note or signature to an invoice i'm informed i don't have permission to make that change, however i do have permission to make the changes and the changes are reflected in the invoiceestimate.
great but.... very great app. i rated three stars because you can‚Äôt enter employee time from your mobile device. i know it‚Äôs a mobile app but you should be able to enter time . i understand that mobile apps are a little different but this seems like a simple task that should be possible. i send invoices and estimates all the time with the mobile app other than that it‚Äôs a great app. will update rating when these features are added
finger print touch does not work. generally ok, not impressive. please fix problem with finger print touch open feature. i keep trying and it will only work one time. i'm still being asked for password.
easy to use. this app is so quick and easy. my business is on the go all of the time and it makes estimates and invoicing so quick and easy.
limited. not much functionality compared with the desktop app, frustrating. unable to access banking or create bills. desktop app is terrible, every time i pay a bill and send an email payment notification i have to delete the words ‚Äúthanks for your business!‚Äù as if i want to thank my suppliers for their business...
"good but some issues with apple. users with the customersales limited access may have problems. 3 different apple phones used and same errors appearing. ""you do not have the rights to view this information."" no problems with androids"
okay. i'm new to doing my own bookkeeping and find this product clunky and not very easy to use. issues with importing transactions and program changing dates and the order compared to the bank. it's not very easy to see what account transfers are moving tofrom. it's hard to distinguish credits for debits. poor customer service. no good summary graphs. slow to attach receipts. multiple clicks to do basic things. cuts off file names if there too long.
good. excellent app. some very slight issues with layout and the occasional page that can't be used on ipad. but overall good. would recommend to others
quickbooks online is a lifesaver!. we have a small family owned and operated business. i love the simple user interface that quickbooks online uses. it's very easy to get started with and it saves us so much time. the reports are clean and well put together and it gives me so much flexibility when categorizing expenses. it also integrates perfectly with our square card reader and gives us the option to attach receipts. all around perfect bookkeeping software for people on the move!
stupid app. and never works right nightmare to login
app crashes constantly. i used to love this app. the last couple of months the app crashes daily and multiple times. i‚Äôm in the middle of working and the app says critical updates are needed and logs me out. i‚Äôm extremely frustrated with this considering i pay over $20month to use this software across all my devices.
hate it. i officially hate this program and will be changing to another accounting software in july. i have been using quickbooks since 2000 and used to love its simplicity but it has become time consuming and harder to use. make a mistake...can't fix it. if you are away you can' access all the feature using the app  you find a computer and log on.
experience getting worse. entering transaction requires way too many taps. it isn‚Äôt location aware to suggest transactions you just always search. recent updates have some bug that makes the app download the data file with almost every login and login often you must. usually twice a week it loses my password. i have enjoyed quickbooks online but this app experience may have me evaluating competitors in december.
quickbooks. very good app i will purchase after my trial thanks
absolutely love it! best business accounting app. great mobile online app tool that syncs with your online quickbooks on both mac and pcs. is everything that you could ever want or need for bookkeeping, accounting, invoicing and estimates.
app doesn't connect on ios 9. ever since ios upgrade 9.3 and quickbooks mobile app doesn't sign in, always says check internet connection. it's a bug in the app and they know it, we contacted support to fix it and they said they are working on it and will have a solution by end of may. this problem has been on for more than 4 weeks with no solution. poor app with poor support. not recommended at all.
needs work. for such a big name app, i'm very surprised that it still hasn't been updated for iphone 6, especially considering we all pay $1540 a month for the service. the app could also benefit from touch id login, instead of requiring a pin code.
latest update issue. the latest update does not allow you to create a sales receipt, estimate, invoice, etc., from the customer, you need to go to the home screen to work around it. this is better than the last time this happened (within the last several months) at which point there was no work around. at least we can process cards for now...
best accounting software. best investment made so far on quickbooks and the app just excels... this is really awesome :) big ups intuit
"disappointing. if you also make ""mint"", why make your subscription service app so much worse? mint is great. this app is not."
latest update buggy. the latest update will not compiler updating.
great app!!!!!. great app for your business. really makes things easier and proactive. it also tracks everything
could be better. while it's great to access your company file while mobile it lacks certain details and or functions that make it a complete app. the option for creating purchase orders is available but only for an expense not an inventory item. disappointed.
very good. good job i would like to add pictures to the estimates i would like to see a calendar with all the jobs and i would like to drag them to change it to a different date
great for start ups. i am wanting to know if it has been considered for users to use their finger print as an option other than the password to sign in on the app?
bugs and features not working. there is a lot of potential here but also problems. our accountant would like us to use this software yet some of the features don‚Äôt work on the mobile app and even on the website there are still many bugs. the biggest is only a few of the accounts created in chart of accounts are available. most are not available in the app and even on the website are ‚Äúgreyed out‚Äù and off limits.
reinstall to fix bad update. i've had all the problems everyone else had with the new update. i believe the simple fix was to delete the app, and reinstall it. once i did that it's been working like it used to.
hopeless. ever since my accountant asked to use it, the app is never able to retrieve any data keeps giving a message to say ‚Äòunable to retrieve data‚Äô. what‚Äôs the point of the app if i can‚Äôt see the dashboard and data when i need to?
excelente aplicaci√≥n. muy completa, f√°cil de usar.
easy. great app that is so simple to navigate, and dead easy for business novices. well designed.
great as an assistant to the desktop version.. i've found this app to be a great mobile partner to the full desktop (or online) version. there's a couple functions that aren't available in the app but everything you do need is easily available. i can't connect my bank account because my (non us) bank isn't listed but being able to input expenses as they happen is a great way of keeping updated accounts. reconciliation is a breeze afterwards. it's a great app.
longtime quickbooks user. always pleased with the updates. best program i've used. very user friendly
good app and great support. easy to use although experienced problem with vat rate not being editable in online desktop version. intuit' response was really quick and efficient and friendly. highly recommend.
nightmare to delete account. costs per month!
subscription. cannot updat subscription gives error on can‚Äôt upload data, now expired, very frustrating need solution
improvements. 1) stock quantity should be displayed in the app 2) round off amount space in invoice
life saver. apart from the fact i have to input my password every time, this app is a great compliment to the version i use on my laptop. so easy to use, can invoice on the spot. very happy.
ios 11 not ready? lot of bugs and crashes. every time i‚Äôm make a new invoice it crashes and take a lot to load and open, still missing two things, send invoices by text message and option to choice your start screen menu
pretty basic and useless. can't do a lot of things. when i'm on the road and away from my laptop i really need to be able to do more stuff. can't customize any reports at all other than by date. can't run reports by location , can't make many edits , can't easily access the data i need. it's very very basic , pretty much a basic overview of your account.
please stop making my sign in. every other fingerprint authentication app on my phone (banking, password manager, file managers) does not nag me to log in via password every other day. why does this app do so? please fix.
can invoice from anywhere. i can start invoices at the gym and finish them at the office ! no longer putting things off and forgetting about them we love it!
qbo is essential. i have my own consulting company and qbo makes running my business much more efficient. even an accountant client agrees. one of the best features is the expense recording. at a business lunch, i'll take a pic of the receipt, record the transaction and that's it. don't have to think about it again. i couldn't function without qbo!
agree with useless. not what i expected. does not have the same functions as qbo. disappointed! would have been great and convenient if all functions were available.
slow, expensive and with poor support. i have been using quckbooks for a year now. it's terribly slow on here and also on the pc, the support is dire, and mostly just does not respond. the only thing that happens quickly in this app is the removal of service if you fail to pay your subscription. avoid! now i'm looking for an alternative that i can migrate my business info etc to without too much fuss.
worst customer support ever. worst customer support in history. using their software and need cs is the best ticket to drive you out of business.
qb online. this software is good but lacks shelf assessment options and the price is slowly getting to much per month. currently just gone up to ¬£21.50month so time to look for a cheaper sole trader option
garbage. app stinks
quickbooks online mobile. wonderful app to allow access from anywhere, from any device. i especially appreciate the increased usability from mobile devices. i did not have to lug my laptop on vacation, but was still able to stay in touch, and function as needed.
very well designed. since the dawn of tablets i‚Äôve been patiently waiting for tablets and apps to be able to handle larger programs. because of quickbooks easy and convenient app. i have converted my business to all ipads. it has not only been an amazing tool for time management and popping out quick quotes. but is a big reason into my cost savings going from expensive laptops to ipads.
app has low functionality. quickbook rocks but the app has very limited functionality leaving it as something not helpful to review reports
quick, easy & powerful. qbo is an excellent product. the functionality and the strength of the product lends itself to a very useful accounting tool. we are pleased with the product. thank you!
paid invoices not turning green or showing paid when they actually are. after receiving the payment, the invoices are not turning green and are not saying paid even though they are paid this is important and needs to be fixed as soon as possible.
awesome job on the ipad app!. really needed this app for quickbooks to keep me mobile. i needed to use quickbooks online but was unable to use my ipad for quickbooks now i can! keep up with the tweaks but i love it!
this is what the iphone app should have been. so much more functionality than the phone app. yeah, it doesn't have reports, but it does have invoicing and transactions, which is great to have access to on the fly. hope they keep improving, but this is a great start for me.
professional.. this app helps me quickly and easily stay looking professional and on time with my invoices and government payments
great idea, but not full version. as a longterm user, i expected more from the app than it has. i still have to use my pc for some of the essential functions such as payables, reports, and payroll. disappointed!
good app. this is excellent for small businesses the only thing i think they should add is a quick way of entering vat on mileage money.
mrs. love quickbooks and this app is sooo easy to use and love it!
problem in showing reports. first of all i would like to say that it is a very good accounts managment software online but there are some problems which is faced by me as compare to the tally software like showing reports and many more and i have complained for that to customer care representative thanks regards muhmmad faisal hussain outflank trading pvt. ltd. 9999926273
great app. i use this everyday! wouldn't want any other invoicing company
nothing but disappointment. car tracking constantly shows that there is uncategorised trips when it is up to date. software won‚Äôt integrate with desktop version. 3 days before end of financial year quickbooks stops bank account updating inputs. then quickbooks support solution causes double entries. two week later accounts won‚Äôt update anymore again.
can't save my invoices!. my app auto updated. now i can't save my invoices on the go. i use this app all day, 6 days a week. i'm in the home services industry and i can no longer invoice my clients, which means i can't collect payment either! get this fixed!
new update has stopped my app from working!!!. since the update i now can‚Äôt accept anything or change anything!!! the only thing i can do it add the expenses!!!! sort it out please!!!!!
well made basic accounting. quickbooks online has been extremely useful. i have a small contracting business, and i can record an expense in seconds, photo the receipt, create an invoice or estimate, and email these to customers. syncs instantly and automatically across multiple devices, so it's on my phone, tablet and online. the cost is tiny, and it takes care of itself  no more shoebox!
works when you're on the go!. easy app navigation. easy to create, send,invoices.
great app. saves me a lot of time. very fluid with payments and bank transfers.
best choice for modern businesses. quickbooks online (qbo) could be a challenge for those resistant to change, or those not looking to grow their business. but for business owners hungry for dynamic, realtime financial data to both interpret and grow their businesses, qbo is key. the combination of qbo and integrated applications (tailored to your specific industry and workflow) aid in gaining efficiencies which eliminating redundancies, manual data entry and a few other timesaving and (human error) opportunities. highly recommended.
no access to payroll. the app seems to have a menu for everything except payroll. i find these types of oversights all over quickbooks online glaringly obvious features that are incomprehensibly missing and customer service has no answers. don't waste your time.
mr. a very practical application with absolutely brilliant back up support and service !!!
great program. very user friendly and much better than the traditional one. love how easy it is to track all of my expenses and can just snap a picture of them. highly recommended!
not bad but lacking ocr features. great app but the expense features is lacking ocr functionality that other apps provide for free. qbo please add ocr and auto input of date, merchant and amount in the expense fields. it will be so much quicker to match.
almost five star. the app is good, no crashes , only problem is that there has to be away to enter supplier bills , posted to accounts payable, not only as cash credit card payments
update killed app for me!. used to love this app as i‚Äôm a paid subscriber, but the recent update doesn‚Äôt launch anymore. i‚Äôve tried removing and reinstalling same result. iphone x.
garbage!. they update the app and completely remove support for ios 8! i understand making a newer version only compatible with newer ios, but why block legacy users all together? it worked great on ios 8 before, now the same version of the app suddenly says i need to upgrade! i pay $30month for this garbage!?
multiple companies. love the app when it's working properly. doesn't switch between companies well, it'll show customers for my other company under the wrong account and makes it impossible to actually work from. i'm sure if you just have one business account it works fine.
time saver. i highly recommend this app, specially for small business. quick, easy and in combination with service m8 it's all i need.
quickbooks = easy bookkeepping. love the mobile app, very easy to use. access accounts from anywhere, raise invoices, pay invoices. simplified bookkeeping!!
amazing. amazing app
quickbooks owner. saves me tons of time!
works okay but app needs work. funny how if they spent a little more time and money on their point of sale app that they could get two to three times the amount of business. the app needs work. there needs to be more options for customizing the invoice and it really lacks customer management ability. if your just going paperless it‚Äôs not bad but like i said the app could really use some work.
brilliant!. easy to use, matches payments received and ties them off with your invoices, easy to see profit and expenses for each month. well worth the monthly payment, my books have never been so easy to keep!
missing functionality. reliable app but authentication is too slow. also some features aren't available. i sometimes just use the web app through the browser to access those features.
aplicaci√≥n √∫til y pr√°ctica. el uso de la aplicaci√≥n es f√°cil e intuitivo y permite controlar casi todas las funciones de la versi√≥n web. en mi opini√≥n lo √∫nico que falta es la capacidad de hacer tareas offline. esto ser√≠a de gran ayuda para avanzar el trabajo cuando est√°s sin conexi√≥n (en un avi√≥n por ejemplo) y tambi√©n es importante que se ampl√≠e la posibilidad de conectar con m√°s bancos, el m√≠o no est√° disponible ahora y eso es una carga de trabajo extra. enhorabuena
40 min on hold with customer support. the app works fine, but 40 minutes on hold with customer support? not so much.
awesome. love it , great app.
consider other programs.... purchased quickbooks for the fact it is easy to photograph receipts and upload, which worked for about 2 weeks and now always comes up with a error.... tried reinstalling etc, still doesn‚Äôt work. useless.
quick books. great app
great starter app. i wouldn't want to use this app all the time as is is a little annoying. does what it says on the tin, great as a starter accountancy tool.
love it!. best app for my business!
good unless u need their help. i had a problem as accidentally created 2 companies in the one profile. subscription applied to wrong company and they had no idea how to fix it. the company with all my accounting was cancelled as ‚Äòtrial ended‚Äô but other company with no data was fully subscribed. very frustrating when dealing with idiots in the phone!
app doesn't work. since updating this a couple of days ago, can't open the app at all. please sort!
mgrm. great app. useful and easy to use. sample and easy to use
crashes when adding images of receipts. i want to give it 4 stars, but the 2 things i do are problematic. crashes when saving images of receipts every 3 or 4 times. also i can't add time entries which would be incredibly helpful. really close to awesome though.
cvc. looks very promising... let's see as i used it. nice and brilliant user interface so far.
hit or miss. when it works it is awesome, however it's been rare that it works. 9 out of 10 times i get an error has occurred message and i have to use the desktop to resolve it.
binoy. easy to use interface love the app
mr. great app for when i'm running around out of the office.
very easy to use and good app. very easy to use and good app
awful program. glitchy... no help at all from customer service, i paid my fee and they used it to open a new account instead of paying for the one i had. ‚Äúunable‚Äù to refund me... i spent three hours on the phone today with three different people, absolutely no help, no service, no one has any idea what the hell they‚Äôre doing, a very poorly run company. disappointed
excellent program. üëç
love it. huge time saver to photo and input expenses. i can't imagine my life without it.
the latest version keeps crashing. open the app and it crashes. try to enter a payment and it just keeps processing, not finalizing the command. i've tried it 10 times. i've closed out the app to reload, powered on and off my iphone, and nothing is working. please fix!
ouickbooks. setting up this quickbooks app is a joke , the system does not work and customer support has an attitude that is not willing to help!
great system easy to use. i really like the online version better than the windows. the app is easy to use i highly recommend this app quick books has completely changed the way i run my business. every thing is so organized and neat now. i don't lose recipes any more. witch is a plus the total functionality of the system is great.
still can‚Äôt attach a receipt. even after the most recent update, i still can‚Äôt attach a photo of a receipt. i can select the photo from my library, but the save button has been missing since the last ios update.
"owner. i've used quickbook's desk top version for years, but went to the online version june 2015. at best, the online version is clumsy and full of frustrating quirks (maybe those ""quirks"" should be called ""bugs""). the only real plus with quicbooks online for me and my small company is being mobile. i'm adding two stars unto my rating for that."
first class. really a great app makes life easier
useless. this app is useless. you can't even see your check register. pathetic.
overly complicated for sole prop. this app is useless for simple small business money in money out, it shouldn‚Äôt be this hard and definitely not worth the fight
tr√®s intuitif. je trouve l‚Äôapplication tr√®s intuitive. parfait pour envoyer mes devis et factures quand je suis en d√©placement.
figuring qb. been using this version ( the only one i ever used) for over 2 years. it seem to get better and continue improving. i still feel frustrated at times about a certain feature but whenever i need support it's available.
fix finally now i can get back to work.. this version fixed the errors from the last update. glad it working again. quickbooks has been good except the last update. this one fixed the issue. we us this app for our onsite business and it's great. several times i would send an invoice to the customer when i'm leaving their home and before i get to the next job it's already paid. update. does not work again. :(
great app. i actually love this thing. it's pretty easy to use once you come to understand some of the functions. daunting at first but learning curve isn't too steep. helped me make sense of my numbers.
jp contractor. great app for full business functionality and ease of use. price is a a bit high
game changer!!!. highly recommend qbo for any business trying to keep up with the cloud. the cloud is the future. for our needs converting to qbo from desktop was the winning choice. qb is constantly improving and it shows. we had a lot of people advising us to dive into the desktop version more but i followed my gut feeling. glad i did. it's my opinion that the desktop will be a dinosaur very soon.
whatsapp on iphone. the experience is very good with quick books on iphone. but it is not connecting directly to whatsapp while sending the invoice. the invoice have to be first downloaded into the folder and later it has to be sent.
fix the problem. good app, but fix unicode problem!!! if you are using russian language in the app, making an invoice after you send it to the client or just previewing it  if your invoice in russian than all you can see is ?????? ??? ????? it's definitely unicode problem!!!
the software has been a nightmare recently using iphone and ipad keeps saying i haven't paid. i've written to emails and had absolutely no response to either no refunds either because i can't get the software to work unless i'm in mice studios on my laptop which is being fixed currently i won't be with me for the next four weeks so how i'm supposed to do any invoicing i have no idea this is absolutely ridiculous use sage...
great app. this app is a life saver. they have done a great job with it. i have tried all kinds of other apps and this is by far the easiest to use!
very satisfied!. been using the mobile app for the past 2 months now, and i can say it does everything i need. very easy to issue invoices, receive the money, match, reconcile the bank, calculate the vat! the support people are very helpful and have a lot of patience!
business owner. could use more features and customization on forms and invoices. some basic functions are missing. otherwise helpful. would recommend for a small business.
app can‚Äôt find our data. we are days into this app not being able to access our data: accounting, banking, billing. access is only available through certain browsers on a laptopdesktop. the support team is friendly and wished me luck.
content lacking. content and information through the app is basically useless. there are no features available for in depth data reporting. absolutely atrocious if not using a laptop.
waste of time. don't waste your time if you want to access quickbooks on your ipad or tablet. needs a lot more work
crapapp. quickbooks program is nice though the company's blatant lack of interest in the osx platform baffles me... this app is basically worthless and does not update to changes made online four weeks ago... they have light years to go before this app is worthy of being used...
highly recommended!!. as a self employed tradesman, i was finding myself spending countless hours quoting & invoicing! this app has made running my business much smoother and given me free time on evenings (which is rare). admittedly it was pretty tricky to setup but the support helpline (both telephone & email) were fantastic at helping out. already recommended to other friends in the trade üëç
less than useless. this app does not interface enough of the information from the desktop version. reports are raw numbers and can‚Äôt pull up any supporting information. p&l is worthless. the desktop version seems to miss the point of accounting software. ie making all your information easy to input then easy to analyze in reports. this does neither. qbpro etc was far easier to navigate without the slick graphics and colors. aaaaaargh!
crashes. crashes immediately after i open the application. update was recently done and now i can't use it.
nathalie dodon maquilleuse pigistefreelance makeup artist. j‚Äôadore cet app pour me facilit√© la vie! g√©niale pour les pigistes ou travailleurs autonome. par contre on peut pas faire certaine correction avec l‚Äôapp sur le cellulaire... il faudrait trouver une fa√ßon pour ne pas utilis√© un ordinateur.
terrible. bank wont link and keeps failing, sending invoices and not getting paid as emails are not being received by clients i'm off to get invoice2go see how that goes i don't have this time for all this mess around
crashes almost immediately. running ios 12 and then 13 on an iphone 8. installed the app. put my login info in. accepted that no problem. then boom. app crashes and i‚Äôm back to my iphone home screen. rebooted my phone. deleted and reinstalled the app. makes no difference. still crashes. having this app was a big factor in my decision to run my business on quickbooks and now i‚Äôm reconsidering that before i get any deeper.
buggy app. doesn‚Äôt even open, tried many times opening it on my iphone x for weeks. it doesn‚Äôt even open the app and there hasn‚Äôt been an update to fix that for ages. unable to use it on my phone and having to use it on my laptop which i don‚Äôt always have it on hand. please fix this issue.
satisfied customer. i'm a new user of qb app, and like what i see so far. it's easy to use and is a great asset to help keep my finances straight. it's worth the $10 per month.
makes life easier!. helps me keep record of everything from invoices, payments customers and expenses.
great app. works great for customer signature!
extremely slow. painfully slow on both my mobile device and macbook. also, i have to refresh the app over and over to see the latest data. that wasn‚Äôt the case before. when i opened the app, it used to show the new data.
great app. intuit is rewiting the eay we do accounting and genera finance for small companies, keep it ip
horrible. please update this app so it stops crashing during every use!!! also, critical updates every time you try and do anything???? getting old and frustrating. fix it!!!!! also, why when you update a transaction, it saves it from before the update, so you are doing the work twice???
pretty good could be great. this ties in nicely with the desktop version. it's not 5* purely because of the actual software not the app itself. the customising of the invoice isn't great and adding previous invoices when you first start isn't great but if you're not worried about that it works well!
timed out....... worked for 2 hours on typing big estimate, session timed out, lost everything, how is this able to happen? we send people to the moon in 1969 yet we can‚Äôt safeguardprevent this app from wasting hard work and precious time. it‚Äôs the first time i thought i could throw my ipad into the next county. fix this stupidity
a+. app works great
phone app fail. what ever opinion you have of qbo ... the phone app fails. it will not let you see the estimates and invoices for a customer. they exist, in your system but they do not show up in the app. everything else.... any other feature discussion... it's all irrelevant. if you can't view basic customer info, the app fails.
great features but very unstable and poor support. i‚Äôm an accountant that works with xero, qb and myob. quickbooks online offers probably the best combination of xero and myob‚Äôs best features but is let down hugely by the app‚Äôs instability (very slow and regularly crashes) and their support, whilst very friendly, is poor in quality and suffers from obvious lack of proper systems and workflow. we‚Äôre holding off recommending qb to clients for these two reasons. they aren‚Äôt quite deal breakers but close.
update needed. for the past three weeks has not been tracking the miles. otherwise a 5 star app when working properly.
very good app.... i truly love this app! it permits me to oversee my business' financial condition in real time. i use the qbo plus, it would be nice if it had more of the options present in qb premium for consultants. the project management and customer billing customization would make this an even better app.
good, getting better. not all of the functionality that i want but features are being added. very useful for seeing what's happening.
great app. awesome app for entrepreneur business.
disappointed. downloaded this app so i could buy the payroll feature for my new company but it crashes immediately upon opening.
really helpful!!. i am a computer engineer and being able to make estimates and invoices in the field has really helped me!
great app!. very userfriendly and convenient. great for people who are needing to create invoices and estimates and track expenses. the iphone app is fantastic!
nogo on ipad pro. doesn't look good on ipad pro and doesn't support split screen. need to be able to have qb open on one side and my project system on the other to create invoices.
highly functional for an app. unlike other folks i find that i can get the majority of what i need to accomplish for daytoday business done on this app. very user friendly.
beyond useless. i have long been frustrated by intuit's decision to bar users on ipads from accessing any real functionality in quickbooks. i thought this app might address that problem, but it does not. it does not offer anything useful to me.
awesome!. so easy to categorize expenses and view financial statements in seconds!
great app. removed and reinstalled the app on my iphone. works fine
easy. easy to use, and has all the features i need to run my lawn care business. i recommend it to everyone. my only issue was getting my subscription paid for. i worked it out by calling customer service and they were awesome.
owner. love this app!! easy to use and don't what i'd do without it
yep. great app...appart from the lack of multi currency function...
great for small business. i run a small business mostly through through etsy. this is a great program to keep track of finances. the only thing i wish is it would integrate paypal here payments like it does square. it would be amazing if it could do the same with etsy. alas, i have to type them in by hand. i love the integrate on my iphone, ipad and macbook. it is very streamlined.
super & excellent apps. very user friendly application . i would recommend this software to other people
at your fingertips. it's nice to be able to send invoices and check your books anywhere you are. haven't had any issues.
wow! loving the switch!. it's more than i had ever expected. using square or other solutions or good old fashion checks in the mail are nothing compared to how seamless qbo has made my life. that mac app, ipad app, iphone app and even the apple watch app give me the pulse on our company that i've needed for so long. can't wait to grow into more solutions with qbo!
some good features but limited and pricey.. search features are extremely limited. find an invoice using customer po number? can't. essentially, to find something you have to already know where it is. data differs from desktop version sometimes. only 2 generic reports available in mobile app. disappointing functionality considering the qb online monthly fees!
superb!!!. this is a great app for keeping up to date with accounts. links to my bank accounts and intelligently matches transactions and remembers previous matches and entries. certainly deserves the name quickbooks based on how quickly i can enter my bank transactions. great for multiuser access and very easy to set up. overall this is much better than i expected.
poor need lots of work. this app is terrible on the ios and android. i‚Äôm using it on both and it has tooo many bugs...
not enough!. this app does not have the functionality that qbo has. therefore, useless. if we can't use the ipads in the store, what use is the app? 1. can't enter an invoice with the details 2. can't enter a vendor bill and do splits. 3. can't put payments in undeposited funds. 4. yep, useless.
awesome. great app! making bookkeeping much more enjoyable!
no longer works with ios 13. i just updated to ios 13. the app now crashes immediately after it tries to launch my company. i tried reinstalling it but no luck. please fix this asap!
mobile genius. i'm on the road most of the time. being able to check invoices, write them and get paid is invaluable. it takes a little time to get the hang of, but once you do, it rocks.
great app. i love using quickbook on my phone. very easy to access and a quick way to send my clients invoice and get a signature! i'm definitely paying for this! it's the best app i could have downloaded to take care of business! üíØüíØ
great tool. this app helps me keep track of my business finances and at the click of a button i can see who owes me money or who i owe money to. really useful!!
great app. it's a one stop accounting app for me and it's made my life so much easier having it.
rubbish. you‚Äôd expect better due to it having bank details, just want customers to get invoices & see that they‚Äôve paid , quite embarrassing when it takes longer to open the app than do the job , very disappointing üò°
affordable truck repair inc.. great app, makes it very easy for us to keep track of our books.
qb. completely unusable since 6th september update. crashes all the time on latest ios please fix this.
cc payment signature window. love the app but, something was changed in one of the recent updates. the screen for the customer to sign to authorize cc payment was made into smaller window. every time you touch it to try and sign, it just moves the window up and down. you can barely make a single line. starting to get frustrating for customers and myself. please address this asap thanks!
pas satisfaisant. j'ai √©t√© forc√© de passer de quickbooks 2009 la solution en ligne car je veux une solution fran√ßaise. j'ai perdu la fonction multicompagnies et la fonction budget, 2 fonctions essentielles. de plus il est √† peu pr√®s impossible d'avoir du service en ligne digne de ce nom. tentez de trouver autre chose avant d'en faire l'acquisition
very easy and convenient!. i love having the mobile app. it makes it easy to enter transactions on the spot without having to stop and open up my computer to login.
quickbooks is good but‚Ä¶. slight learning curve and seems to have a few annoying bugsquirks.
no longer works with ios 13. i just updated to ios 13. the app now crashes immediately after it tries to launch my company. i tried reinstalling it but no luck. please fix this asap!
great app. works great for managing customers and invoices for our company!
no support from quickbooks is brutal. there's no support options provided from quickbooks directly. that's a very poor customer experience, especially when paying $100s per year for this platform. the online community is somewhat helpful, but you're relying on contributions from other random users being accurate, which they may not be. please step up, quickbooks.
doesn‚Äôt load (for me). app doesn‚Äôt load. tap on the icon and nothing happens. i hope no one else has this problem.
excellent app for small business. been using this app for 2 years and we have no complaints. most efficient app for operating a small business. a+
"dissapointed. i was hoping for more. if the app has issues logging into a bank account, ect. it gives you an error code that you have to log onto there website to walk you through what it ""might"" be, then you have to go back and forth, try different things to fix it....ahhhh. you get my pointüòí"
subscription errors. nothing but problems since january. i switched from the download to the app so i could do it at home and it's been nothing but problems, and not even the same ones!!! i have 2 companies, it's june, and i'm still trying to get this straightened out to input this years data.
so good.... love qbo! makes doing bookkeeping in the fly so easy and allows me to capture expenses on the spot!
disappointing. this is a very unstable product with an unreliable app server. if my accountant didn't require it, i would not use it!
overall ok. if you have an issue good luck getting a hold of customer support. freezes up at least once a week and sometimes i can‚Äôt get into my invoices. for what i am paying for i expect more
fix crash. my quickbooks app was crashing on my ipad 3, after i did the upgrade. press and hold the app icon and uninstall it. then, download it again. it now works.
poor. if you write a review and the nickname is taken you have to start all over again. app is very limited and web version has problems with ipad pro
instant customer service üëå. great app for small to mid size business. phenomenal integration from windows 10. so far so good. thanks.
limited functionality. can't do a bunch of stuff on the app. largely useless. editing invoices is a nightmare.
garbage update. please test all your updates before releasing them to paying clients!!! invoicing issues, client search issues, expense issues, wth!!!
last update ruined a great app. invoices won't save now and a customer file disappeared. please fix this app back to operational use soon!
"good app. quickbooks is just about perfect for my small business, one addition i would like is to be able to easily see a ""spend per customer"" button so i can easily add up the amount any repeat customer spend per yearmonth."
when it works it‚Äôs great. this app will not recognize my credentials even as i use the online version. i wish it were reliable and i was able to use it consistently. even reinstalling the app does not fix the problem. intuit needs to focus on making this app work on a regular basis as you pay for this service.
problems with touch id. the touch id feature has a lot problems, doesn't work properly, please fix it
new update is awful. the newest update is so awful! i can't post things on my invoices, i can't email invoices, nothing! it acts like it is doing it, but then it freezes and tells you to refresh before making changes. i refresh, make the change again, and it gives me the same message again. awful update!
what a joke.. can't add notes to customers. buggy! cant print. awful. if you are moving from qb desktop, think again! there's not even an easy way to just view today's business. no reports in app. useless.
app is great for any business. i have a small business and this application is awesome. especially if you have a mobile business. this make like so much easier for your customer to pay online. inventory management is very easy to use and update
too sophisticated for just personal budgeting. i have been using quickbooks since 2006 and its predecessor before 2006. i only use it for my personal budgeting of 14 bank accts, 10 mortgages and 6 credit card transactions. sometimes i cannot figure out how to enter a transaction (transfers between accts, accepting matching transactions, credit card individual transactons versus balance payment) without creating a double entry or it cancelling out an entry. love, love, love the online version that i can access via iphone.
great app. good for a non accounting person like me. i can keep track and give it all to my accountant and it gets done. i love that i can send invoices from my ipad and enter info etc. two thumbs up!
really needs an easier login. since the last update, logging in is a huge pain. touch id rarely works.fix this.
top notch. this app works great, easy to use after i played around with it for a bit. very convenient and quick to use.
great app. this does everything i need it to do!
new and improved. i waited a long time to change over to the online version per the advice of my accountant. it was worth the wait. it's a much better version and easier than the regular version of qb
way to much money for the service don't buy into claims. never is up to date loads so slow a total waist of money.
awesome app. this app really helps me keep track of all my transactions for my pool business. easy to use and has everything i need.
great app. excellent app, does exactly what i need with no fuss
mgrm. great app
good. it works really well, one thing that would be nice in the app is an option to batch email invoices, or make an option to automatically email after you create each invoice
great app. good app. better if it had tracking of vehicle km like the self employed version
really wish it was hipaa compliant. i have a healthcare related company. my billing process would be a lot easier and faster if i could send invoices through my secure network or if qbo was hipaa compliant.
amazing. at last i can invoice on the move and do the rest of my book keeping as i go. great app and easy to use.
app crashes. the app crashes immediately when i try to open it. i haven‚Äôt been able to use the app for a few months now which is quite disappointing considering i pay for its services.
rockin. full throttle on the go. just buy it, you want regret it.
cis transactions. cannot carry out cis transactions in the app for some reason, you have to use the web version. this is really annoying and somewhat inconvenient. other than that, a great app....
app login. i can not login to app using my online login details. have reset again and again and nothing works. very frustrating
not helpful. this app doesn't help me. i get errors every time i try to match or categorize a transaction from my bank. it's useless for me.
app is glitching. ever since the new update to the quickbooks mobile app, it has been glitching every time i try to open the app. every time i click the app it closes by itself. it's frustrating whenever i have to log anything in the app. i have to constantly delete the app and reinstall it for it to work properly again.
missing data on iphone and ipad. i have an issues where invoices are missing for some customer on both iphone and ipad. the show up absolutely fine on the web. i can see the payments but get the error when i open the payment qbm.error.00500000.reason.iphone. please fix asap
great for invoicing out but that‚Äôs it. was hoping this was the answer to our accounting. it‚Äôs quick and easy to send invoices and take pics of your receipts but when it comes to inputting invoices you receive from your suppliers it‚Äôs a huge let down!! waste of time
open & closes. what's going on. the app just open and closes on my ipad. i can access is on my iphone, but the ipad version is not accessible.
game changer. totally transformed my business. really great software, so informative and nice community to support you. no brainer. can't believe i'm raving about accountancy software!
needs better support. i thought this was a great app then it wouldn‚Äôt allow expenses to be uploaded, one of the main reasons for using this on the mobile app, support we‚Äôre worse than useless and could give no time scale as to when this would be fixed to a small business working on the go this defeated the whole point of using a mobile app, am looking for alternatives
be careful you will be charged $12,99 a month. did not know this app was going to cost me $12.99 a month. they make it hard to cancel. no unsubscribe or any other function if you don't want a monthly cost...don't download
a1 app. i love this app ! i'm using it all day !
*terrible app*. do not take the chance with this program its flawed at best and is only designed to take as much money off you for as long as possible. it has multiple errors all the time. find something for better value and don‚Äôt pout it in control of your business because when it fails you have no control whatsoever.
good functionality; could use a few more of the online features. very easy app, works very nicely in the field. would be more handy if the iphone or ipad versions allowed for time tracking or payroll functions.
low rating until the app supports chart of accounts. the app continues to be undeveloped for functions that are developed in the web interface. the app is excellent for invoices and credit card transactions if you have a merchant account coupled to your qbo account. the camera can be used in app to document your receipts to the cloud and i use it extensively for hotelairfarerental car expenses and they can be attached to invoices when emailing your customers.
poor need lots of work. this app is terrible on the ios and android. i‚Äôm using it on both and it has tooo many bugs...
please: give us delayed charge. for the love of gawd, why can i not add a delayed charge on the mobile app?????? this is something you actually want to do when you're at a client, not get them to sign for an invoice every time you visit them during the month.
love it. still can't enter bills. bills are strangely missing. can do expenses. otherwise very nice program on my phone!
mileage tracker not working.. so far quickbooks support has not been able to get the mileage tracking feature to work on my phone. iphone6. won‚Äôt manually of automatically track mileage and wb support has not resolved or explained why. partial functionality is not good enough!
could be better. while it's great to access your company file while mobile it lacks certain details and or functions that make it a complete app. the option for creating purchase orders is available but only for an expense not an inventory item. disappointed.
glitchy software loses emails really crappy support. issues remain for years intuit does not fix. loses emails all the time invoices say sent when they are not.
stop taking my money. i don‚Äôt use your app but you‚Äôs still take my money
good. good apps
smallbusiness rocket!. great app. this is making my small business very productive. especially since the account is device agnostic. i can use it on my device or login online and be just as efficient.
app shows incorrect transactions. transactions do not match the selected vendor. works when you have few transactions. once you pass 20k it becomes slow and inaccurate.
perfect. changed over from using sage about 6months ago and have never looked back, excellent software, the app makes it completely agile and useable on the move.
what a disappointment. this was to replace my desktop version. it did not. just finished the tax year and my cpa said about how difficult the online version was to work with doing the taxes. you cannot bill multiple expenses on a single invoice. multiple line items mean multiple expenses.
app is great for any business. i have a small business and this application is awesome. especially if you have a mobile business. this make like so much easier for your customer to pay online. inventory management is very easy to use and update
still no touch id. i used to think this was a great app, but now with these last 2 updates, i have to constantly uninstall the app and still no touch id. why when something works fine can you not just let it be. please fix back
great service. i enjoy each platform they offer for me, computer and iphone. only issue is they hiked up the annual price without notice. still affordable but i was expecting the same price i originally paid.
still useless for me. all i want to do is add my time activity and delayed charges for my clients via my iphone. that's my necessary daily task. i don't need to look at my balance sheet every day, change my company information, or customize my default email message with my iphone.
great, when it works. app is great, seamless when it works. problem is, it's only about 75% of the time. lots of errors on the mobile and desktop versions. any complaints go unaddressed. if you can run your business on 75% proficiency with no accountability from quickbooks tech support, then this app is for you!!
not suitable. not happy with this app and it won't let me cancel it! help!
great. very useful for a small farm.
subpressions. like the mobile app
negative stars  if possible. i find it amazing intuit promotes such an obvious clunker. why don't they just buy square and tie that in  or at least imitate it. intuit is lost when it comes to transactional businesses. at any rate  as almost all users point out here  this app is useless and should be an embarrassment to intuits development team.
great way to punish your workers. yeah, a client uses this and when he sent me a 1099 it took 30 minutes of creating an account, retrieving passwords, recreating passwords, etc just to look a file that was supposed to be mailed weeks ago. terrible system trying to force the people you work with into accounts and products to access forms that are legally required. please use other software and services that care more about their user experience.
excellent software. best products, excellent customer service, can't imagine how i would manage without it. thanks quickbooks!!!
trouble with ipad app. hello, i have the app in my iphone and it works great, but i have downloaded the app in the ipad and it tells me: looks like your account doesn‚Äôt include access to the quickbooks online mobile app... what i need to do to have access?. please advice! thanks
hopeless. ever since my accountant asked to use it, the app is never able to retrieve any data keeps giving a message to say ‚Äòunable to retrieve data‚Äô. what‚Äôs the point of the app if i can‚Äôt see the dashboard and data when i need to?
having issues with iphone 11. after installing the app, and attempting to access it results in crashing.
better than xero. brilliant app. seamless to use. all of my clients now use it!
negative stock entry. i have been using this app from 5 days.. please make a provision of not issuing invoice when the stock is 0.. plus while entering the purchase bill give a column of itemised discount in the items
great bookkeeping tool but app lacks features. quickbooks is the absolute best bookkeeping app out there! the full function web app works wonders but the app needs to be updated to include most of those functionalities.
user. good app but needs more features
quickbooks is genius. i don't normally write reviews for apps. but quickbooks online is simply amazing. i've been using it for over a year and i absolutely love it. i can download transactions from the bank so no boring data entry and can create invoices on the go on my phone. so good.
"ireland. works well in ireland but some difficulties with irish vat which for small businesses operate on ""receipts basis"" for vat. but work arounds available.. reporting is great. emailing invoice is so easy. this is cloud accounting at the best and improving all the time. david fields in dublin ireland"
i prefer it to the 'software' version. i like the mobile access.
best app. amazing!
nice, but naughty. i am writing this review at christmas, that explains the headline :) this app used to be awesome. now i get a lot of can not connect to data or can not refresh data even after multiple refreshes. hope they fix it
impressive for mobile. i posted a bad review because of some bugs. i received an immediate response about upcoming updates and a week later it was fixed. i love that level of support. nice app too.
don't update!!!!. if you are using the current version of quickbooks online for your ipad 2, don't update. it will lock you out. then you will have hours of dealing with the horrible customer no service that intuit provide for this mess of a product.
awoolridge. i like the app and actually find it easier to record payments from customers than the online version. however, it is frustrating that you cannot perform all duties ie. creating estimates and invoices etc.. let's ramp it up qb. ;)
good app. it's come a long ways since it was first introduced. can't be without it!
amazing that i can make invoices and take payments literally anywhere with cell service.. i think it's an amazing app. the only downfall is i can't add invoices from vendors that i haven't paid yet. only expenses that are already paid. hence the 4 stars. if they had that feature it would be a five star for sure.
new to qb on line. brilliant package but did need support on getting the data i migrated over sorted. but worth the monthly charges. great job quick books.
expenses are easy to track. simple way to track expenses when out and about
works well enough. i'm not in love with using apps on my phone, so it was confusing to relearn the app after the recent update. i can't seem to find some things on the phone app that i can easily find on a laptop.
reduced feature set. need to have timesheet function put into app! please!! also, the separation of vendor mtce from vendor transactions is opposite of the web interface. same for customers.
like the app. i find the app to be very useful in the field. unfortunately since the latest update adding new customers seem to slow the app down and to a crawl. wish there was a way to get that bug fixed
please fix!!. i have used this app for the last few years for my business and have loved it. this latest update has made the app virtually unusable. it won't let me save an invoice, doesn't show payments made, makes me sign in every time even though i have a pin and the list goes on. very disappointed and hoping this is fixed soon.
small business. i use it for estimates and invoices really don't use it to its fullest. but... i like it
mixed bag and ball and chain. a great improvement over the years but the system breaks down at the worst times. today(friday) could not access any of the program for 4 hours. no invoices. no purchase orders. yikes!! when it works, it works well.
convenience. work, document, review with my custom needs, deliver receipts to my customers in one transaction and get back to work with my mind clear to work for a reasonably affordable rate.
be warned about quickbooks. this is not software. it‚Äôs ransomware. every two or three years they make it break and force you to upgrade. the upgrade is the same price as buying it new. the online version is just as bad. when i started using it it was $15 a month and now it‚Äôs $40 a month. be smart and don‚Äôt become a slave to intuit company.
review. everything is great but the inability to create packing slips from the app. kind of a key part of doing business...
crashes too much, stressful. doing accounting is difficult enough. why did quickbooks create an app that crashes and creates frustration then?! this is not my phone's problem, because i have the latest apple model.
qb online. tout ce qu'il faut pour la pme. facilit√©, mobilit√©, flexibilit√©! un support technique accessible, comp√©tent et rapide.
stuck in the test version. it is all great in theory, yet there are so many glitches. you can‚Äôt search by address. it crashes too often. frequent notifications that as an example your deposits weren‚Äôt recorded properly do you want to fix them? i shouldn‚Äôt need to fix the bank deposits. please fix the bugs! oh and not all of my clients made the transition from the desktop version to the online version. also quickbooks asked me to rate quickbooks online 4 times today alone.
best invoice app. easy to use quickly paid
good app. excellent
satisfied customer. fantastic program very user friendly. love it
quick book app works amazing!!. love using the app for my tree company lets me be on the road and make up invoices.
great app and the best accountancy system so far.. i've tested many different products from competitors and quick books is the best so far. i've used online version first and then downloaded mac app which is quite fast to use. mobile app works seamlessly with both and its great business tool. i don't really understand other negative reviews and people having issues with software. please make sure you're using latest updated version of the app and your ios. thanks matt
i seriously hate qb online & the app. coming from qb for mac, the learning curve has been awful. so many things that should be intuitive aren't, and too many, seemingly little, functions don't exist in these versions, which makes my job so much harder. i wish i could switch software, but it's what my cpa uses, so i have to use it too  ugh!
awesome!. i was hesitant about switching from desktop top to online, but once i adapted i found it was so convenient for people on the go. very simple and easy and ver accurate between desktopiphoneipad. extremely happy i made the change, highly recommended.
more than annoyed..... new update: 8916, still have to enter my password every time i open the app. touch id or app pin what is that??? ü§î this is so annoying.... especially in front of customers!! tired of wasting my time. i've deleted and reinstalled the app to no avail. it appears you guys are never going to get it right....
okay. this app would be perfect if it didn‚Äôt redirects me to safari to login every single time
great customer support. when they updated the app they changed how bank deposits are recorded. it used to be from the home screen you could tap the plus sign and in addition to entering a debit you could add a deposit. they took that away and i was confused. but their customer support responded quickly to my review explaining that they had moved it to the top three bars. i‚Äôm solved! and i really appreciated them responding.
service date. been told by intuit several times that service date will be available on invoices almost a year ago....still nothing and it is crucial to have in the lawn care biz
new update has stopped my app from working!!!. since the update i now can‚Äôt accept anything or change anything!!! the only thing i can do it add the expenses!!!! sort it out please!!!!!
quickbooks online for the ipad. it works great!! anywhere at anytime. create your customers, create the estimate and then bill it out!! if your smart you will setup the direct payment to your bank account too!!
for last month since major online update its is useless. when i login it tells me i don‚Äôt have a subscription. i call support they tell me to uninstall the app and reinstall. after reinstall the login works but you cannot switch between your companies. i called them back. they said no one else is reporting this. three users in my offivr are having the same problem. i love the iphone app for entering receipts on the go but i can‚Äôt even do that now.
can not do custom invoice numbers. the app can not do custom invoice numbers. i have had the app for two months and paying the monthly fees and have not been able to send out my first proper invoice. i have asked support and they come back with instructions to go to certain settings that do not exist on the app.
disappointed. downloaded this app so i could buy the payroll feature for my new company but it crashes immediately upon opening.
crashes. every time i try signing in the app says my sign in has expired.
great!!!. i love this app i love qbo what else is there to say. recent update created tons of issues with ios 9.3.3 some glitches evolved not sure who's fault but hope they get fixed. i appear to get error messages entering my expenses :(. can't save invoice created either please fix. otherwise when the app works it's great one star is its current state.
new update has me locked out. automatic update to my software today. now i can access my account. fix it now! i am paying way too much to not be able to access my account!
easy and convenient. i own a construction business, and have grown very fond of this app. it's really convenient to use the app to maintain our books on the go. my husband and i wear many hats in our business. our time is precious, but quickbooks online helps free up some of that time with its ease of use.
great app. very happy we use if for all our companies and recommend to our clients
ran into unsupported transactions within 1 minute.. the app is difficult to navigate, bloated and slow, using a ton of wireless data. the app would be much better as multiple singlefunction apps. i mean, do i really need to log in to qb to snap a pic of a receipt and submit it for later? typical quickbooks bad experience. very disappointing.
6s (ios 9.x). it takes a while to learn the nuances of this app (and the online interface), but once you do, a decent enough experience awaits. note to devs: (1) the app freezes anytime you review added attachments (eg, receipts) when inputting expenses; and (2) users should be able to modify the method of payment when editing expenses (option currently unavailable) instead of having to delete and recreate the entry.
meh, no project profitability reports in the app. as a construction business all our accounting revolves around p&l reports per project. the onlinedesktop app gives us the project report but the app does not, which makes the app pretty much useless. our best solution is to login to our qbo account through safari on the phone to see the real time project profitability, shouldn‚Äôt the app do that?
major flaw. the app ui is pretty good and i really like the interface. the problem is that a lot of my invoices are not even viewable on the app. basically anything that has a delayed charge on it won't show up so there is a major glitch there or something.
nice app that works well!!. works well, well thought out and presented. helps me day to day for sure!!
high hopes cause big fails. the app crashes all of the time. no integration with desktop versions but ok. i though i would have something on the go for small invoices. i can't get through the first invoice. all progress gets lost with the crashes. i love how much time i save with the desktop version. there customer service has always been terrible. they can't even have a fully working version for the trial period. fail!
quick books online. good for customer data base. good for invoicing and receiving payments. fair at tracking expenses. near useless as an accurate or bookkeeping tool when linked to a bank account. so many obscure and poorly explained manual actions required that error is easy to introduce and tech support usually makes things worse. one may as use good old fashioned paper ledgers and a calculator. don't trust it with your numbers!
company owner. you can't go in an manage users unless you have a desktop version that's just not acceptable i have an ipad pro cost 3times what my computer cost it better get fixed or i am gone.very disappointed. also customer service can't help either rg
good. nice app
just awful!!!. is this seriously how you're going to roll out your app by pissing off customers. can't even sign in half the time due to 'connection errors'. your company is an ultra fail.
deposits take too long. overall the app is convenient for clients to pay me, but it takes entirely too long for deposits to be posted to my account.
streamlined management. this is a very intuitive software for finances.
useless app. used to a quickbooks user a couple of years ago, and it was ok then, but now i have recently returned and find it rubbish. a simple thing like adding a company address is turning out to be an impossible task. total waste of my time. it you are a small business using the app via iphone or ipad forget it. stay away
ŸÑÿßŸäÿØÿπŸÖ ÿßŸÑŸÑÿ∫ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ© ŸÉŸÅŸàÿßÿ™Ÿäÿ±. arabic language support at least in invoices not in gui which is an easy job to do ! arabic invoice with rtl support in produced pdf is needed to let me think to subscribe .
great app. best software for small business, better priced than other software on the market.
bugs. i had quickbooks for two years but had to switch because of prevalent bug issues. eventually i had to reinstall the app every time i wanted to use it.
bugs and bugs it a jungle. 1. kicking out of the app very often. 2. not able to email multiple invoices at one time. 3. limited search capabilities. cant search notes and description. :(
"buggy, issues with sync. for some reason this app is constantly having connection issues for me. i get messages like ""transaction not accepted"". then i have to log into the desktop version to actually do the work. ok for a glance but not useful for productivity."
19.11.2 awful update. first thing i noticed was there is no search bar for customers, so i have to scroll through thousands of customers to find the one i‚Äôm looking for. secondly, i had hoped that we‚Äôd be able to view estimates and invoices in landscape mode to see them better, nope. then, when i tried to navigate back to the main customer list, there‚Äôs no back button! this version was nowhere near ready to be released.
fix finally now i can get back to work.. this version fixed the errors from the last update. glad it working again. quickbooks has been good except the last update. this one fixed the issue. we us this app for our onsite business and it's great. several times i would send an invoice to the customer when i'm leaving their home and before i get to the next job it's already paid.
terrible app. you are unable to view and use the register, reconcile accounts and other simple everyday banking tasks. logging into your company through a mobile browser, such as the google chrome app for ipad, does give you access to some but not all tasks. isn't the purpose of online banking to be able to perform all banking from mobile devices?
amazing. i haven't seen smart accounting software like this üëçüèº
ran into unsupported transactions within 1 minute. very disappointing. it seems like the app isn't complete.
good start. i wish i could log my time on the app. i suppose i have to pay extra for that. big disappointment.
great timesaver. i used the free app and i have made up my mind that i will be purchasing this for my small construction business.
broken for ios 13 please update. when you jack up the price 25% i expect more
great tool. a great app for invoicing on the fly and emailing customers invoices when they forget them or you need to look up how much they owe. no this isn't the full blown desktoponline version and i don't think that was the intent. it does what i need it to while i'm not at a computer.
report must show sales receipts as well. reports must show sales receipts as well and not only invoices. qb allows you to generate sales receipts for customers who paid at the point of sale, hence the report functionality in the app must show these receipts as sales otherwise, the whole report is meaningless. also, more basic reports are needed such as p&l, balance sheet, suppliers, transactions....etc. thx anyway.
it gets better and better. i was a huge sceptic (i have been a pro advisor for several years)and very had a very negative opinion of qb online. that was until a couple of years ago when i attended a presentation of the capabilities of the software. i was sold on its usefulness and have been using and recommending it ever since. qb online adds important features regularly. buy it!!! you won't be disappointed
more reports please. i wish i could see more information in reports, even if they have to be precanned reports. i understand the app is more for onthego, but it would be incredibly useful for me.
too many clicks for attachments. i keep track of all transactions by taking pictures of the receipt, checks, deposit receipts, and just about everything then attach them to the transaction. with the user interface rule of thumb of three clicks access to specific functions, attachments can take as many as five to six clicks to save a picture, which is very annoying and time consuming.
incomplete. getting there very slowly. useful up to a point, but why not the ability to enter a bill, only an expense? and there's still no sales orders in any of the online versions. intuit needs to step up development to satisfy its longstanding quickbooks desktop customers.
awesome app. quick books is really an awesome app. links up to accounts quickbooks payments. i can access from all my devices. it‚Äôs really versatile. you can make great estimates as well. emailed invoices and estimates look very professional.
fix it. quit making me sign in again and telling me my session expired.. there are multiple safety factors already in place that should allow me to open my app and go to work
keep having to uninreinstall. i keep having to uninstall app then reinstall because it gives me a black screen, then closes out. this is the 2nd time i‚Äôve had to do this and it appears it may be a bug of sorts. overall happy with the app but please fix this glitch.
terrible experience with customer support. we had terrible experience with customer support. for a very important issue we contact qb customer support team, we wait for 6 days an never respond our request. for this incident we can't bill our invoices. we hate our experience. consider customer support if your company needs help.
very beneficial app. this is a very beneficial app. it does not replace the pc version but is an excellent aid. it's helpful to send invoices on the go or at the end of a service call. the sooner the customer gets invoice the more chance i have of getting paid. it is a very good aid!
excellent. j ai fait l essai d un mois et je suis conquis ! tr√®s bonne application tr√®s compl√®te et simple √† customiser  la fonction li√©e au comptes est aussi tr√®s pratique m √©vite de recopier toutes mes d√©penses √† la main
no too bad. this app for the self employed version is pretty good. using the ipad is less so, mainly because it will not rotate into landscape view and the appearance of the interface is slightly blurry  not sharp like other apple apps. the features though, on the whole are pretty good.
"it doesn't synchronize. the app is totally unusable. it doesn't synchronize customers and supplier and the transaction with those missing from the list result as incomplete. tried also to dis install and reinstall: same story. on top of this it must also said that the assistance is unresponsive, many days and repeated enquiries to finally get emails full of irritating smileys and useless answers like ""we are constantly improving the apps to serve our mobile customers""."
excellent app. helpful reports and nice review of recent transactions to make sure operations are in tact.
nice but crashes. i like the app other than the fact that after a few minutes of work it crashes. it reliably crashes. helpfully they fix it soon, it's frustrating to have to log back in every time.
slow, expensive and with poor support. i have been using quckbooks for a year now. it's terribly slow on here and also on the pc, the support is dire, and mostly just does not respond. the only thing that happens quickly in this app is the removal of service if you fail to pay your subscription. avoid! now i'm looking for an alternative that i can migrate my business info etc to without too much fuss.
handy, but needs work. the app is pretty hand for some of my clients to invoice on the go or take photos of their receipts. i find it a little too dumbed down for my uses. i would love to be able to add delayed credits and charges and drill down on the financial statements. it would also be great to pull other reports, not just p&l and balance sheet.
moron developers and qa. don‚Äôt bother with this app. more time updating this weekly with version changes and bug fixes... jokers
easy to use for the busy professional. as a busy selfemployed person, quickbooks mobile gives me the easeofuse that i need on the go. i can give instant quotes, create and send invoices, accept payments and avoid the headaches of being tied to a desk to get the job done.
waste of space. all we want to do is access quick books online via our ipads. this app is worthless. as my business continues to grow we will obviously be looking for a software provider that listens to clients instead of putting out disappointments like this. save the space on your ipad and don't bother.
"it was good no it's just horrible. i used to be able to update my invoices from my phone and now it just locks me out. it also used to show when customers viewed my invoices but now it keeps saying ""it might not be up to date"". after 7 years with them. i'm going to find a new pos at the beginning of the year."
great for my small business. i could not run my business without online quick books and having it at my fingertips on my iphone, ipad and iwatch means i can check things on my downtime like when i'm sitting in traffic.
much room for improvement. lack of a solid search function along with slow load times make this an app that leaves a lot to be desired. even the online functionality can use improvement. still a decent system for a small business but hopefully they'll spend some time fixing the app soon.
brilliant!!!!. works like a dream with qb online. i can finish a job and then send the invoice from my phone (whilst sitting at home drinking a cuppa!). can you set up notifications for when an invoice is viewed by the customer?
small business owner. works easily, and as promised. user friendly. training is beneficial but not essential to get started. wonderful for my small business. recommended.
what‚Äôs going on?. i‚Äôm paying almost $11month for an app that ‚Äúcan‚Äôt update payment information right now.‚Äù this has been going on for weeks. i can‚Äôt even send current invoices. pointless to have at this time.
pay attention to billing ~ unethical business practices. intuit upgrades subscription and charges more than advertised price when you are not looking. horrible customer service  unable to reach by phone to resolve their seemingly intentional billing errors. they practice unethical business behavior, but switching costs are very high once accounts are set up.
horrible. what a joke. all i want to do is be able to go to my online account. every time i try to do that it pops up to install this app. i did. now when i go in nothing looks the same or works the same. you would think i would be able to go online without this horrible app. i would give it zero stars if i could.
amazing for bussiness. this app is the best thing a small bussiness owner can have two thumbs up and five stars
‚Äúcritical updates‚Äù. face id does not work. every time i try it tells me there are critical updates and i need to log in again. there are no updates, and it tells me this every single time.
consistent. consistently bad. just like the qb for mac was unreliable and terrible, and purposely left that way to push customers over to qb online, this is no different. buggy, unreliable software is about the only thing intuit excels at.
doesn‚Äôt mirror quickbooks online. it‚Äôs good for looking up customer info like what they owe or phone numbers. if you create an invoice online you may not be able to edit it on the phone. and if you use quickbooks for time tracking the feature doesn‚Äôt seem to be in the cards for the mobile app.
expenses. you cannot cost expenses to a particular job or client
great but wip. better than the competition and best customer service in the space! well worth it.
horrible app even if subscribing!. subscribe to the app yet they want me to pay for a new subscription, waste of money for months!
not many useful features...yet(?). no access to trial balance or p&l reporting. no access to cash balances. no report writing or report generating capabilities. i guess it's free, but i hope there is a robust pipeline of upcoming features.
great as an assistant to the desktop version.. i've found this app to be a great mobile partner to the full desktop (or online) version. there's a couple functions that aren't available in the app but everything you do need is easily available. i can't connect my bank account because my (non us) bank isn't listed but being able to input expenses as they happen is a great way of keeping updated accounts. reconciliation is a breeze afterwards. it's a great app.
not industry standard software. this is a clunky, disappointing, entry level piece of work. qb has been available for many years and i cannot believe that, having been recommended to download by our accountant, it feel like it has barely reached beta testing level. a real pity that microsoft money is no longer supported. that‚Äôs how to put a piece of software together. i have littleno confidence in the product.
support?? wats that??. if you are a person that will ever be involved in actually doing business in the real world, don't waste your time on this. if you ever need an answer at the speed of business in the real world, don't waste your time. you're not worth the expense. actual rating is 5, but the scale won't let me show the truth.
app. best app
great for attaching receipts, not for entering expenses. i love being able to take photos of invoices and receipts and directly attach them to the expense. however, i am unable to add expenses because the app does not have access to my accounts or categories. if there was even a save as a draft option, i would give this a 55. however, i am not able to save any input if i can‚Äôt add the account or categories.
ios 13 problems. quickbooks is normally pretty good, the online version is fantastic. unfortunately the app no longer works on ios13, i will come back once the app has been updated and revise my review.
great product!. i'm good at what i do for a living, but i am not an accountant and i needed help keeping the financial end of my business on track. this product is easy to use and is everything i needed!
flawed. i am going to reinstall the old app. the new app will not allow me to add a customer from my phone's contact list.
nice. nice app but when you have to select item then you have to type whole item code, before update you just type last 23 words and it's there.
best app for my business!. i already have invoicesasap, now i have it's companion, quickbooks! love how they sync and work together to help me understand my finances!
make fit 6 plus. can you make this app fit the 6 and the 6 plus? that would be cool!
a small business must have. i have used quickbooks pro for my small company for many years, but i can't believe i have gotten this far without this app.
signature issues. the app crashes every time i get a signature or it doesn't save the signature. please resolve this issue. it has now been a week and this is still an issue.
never stays connected. i‚Äôm being very generous by giving three stars but every time i use this app, it disconnects from my bank. i have to always use my macbook to sync bank data and keep qb up to date. when it finally syncs, this app rocks and that‚Äôs why i‚Äôm giving three stars. i want to love it, but please fix the syncing issues.
great app. great app
good app. good app, lacking functionality but this will improve in time.
love using quickbooks!!. i love using it and it makes my business so easy and don't even need to carry my computer. i can actually do all of my invoices estimates anytime anywhere with my cell phone!
great app. great app. only wish that it had payroll on it.
pretty good app. this has turned out to be a pretty useful app. very nice to be able to add receipts as i make purchases. very nice to create estimates! i would give it five stars if they would add reports for each customer. the current reports is lame. also very lame i can't add and pay bills!!! come on qb's! it's a business app. we pay bills!!!!!
tide business bank not supported :(. i'm rating this 1 star due to there being no support for setting a business account created via tide
stuck in data download. can't open app on ipad or iphone. stuck in a data download loop. support says there are no known issues, what a joke.
perfect. best thing going! i love being able to invoice on the move
limited compared to quickbooks desktop. quickbooks online is just ok. it has some limits that did not exist in the desktop version. a lot of them have to do with assisted payroll. for example, the app does not tell you each pay period how much of a contribution to pay towards simple ira's and give you a chance to indicate whether they were paid. it just assumes it was done without giving you any notice. other limitations make it just ok.
great software. i have come to really like quick books online. quoting, invoicing, reports and my personal favourite... it links with your bank account to automate expense inputs. you set the rules once and the next time a similar transaction appears in your linked bank account it automatically categorises the transaction for you, just hit 'add'. saves me so much time and effort and to me it's fast becoming a business tool i simply wouldn't be without.
horrible accounting program. barely an accounting program. one would think qb would create an online version mirroring their desktop software. navigating the online software is a headache, let alone using it for basic accounting purposes. of course qb ever improving their software is as likely to happen as me winning the lottery.
great tool. a great app for invoicing on the fly and emailing customers invoices when they forget them or you need to look up how much they owe. no this isn't the full blown desktoponline version and i don't think that was the intent. it does what i need it to while i'm not at a computer.
nice app. works better than the online version
bugs. there are alot of bugs in the app. i am about to go back to square. the app keep giving alot of errors.
great software all round. quickbooks is easy to use and manage. software and app work easily together. makes small businesses life simpler. love being able to use app to do expenses and invoicing on the go.
excellent for small biz and freelancers. as a freelance artist who travels a lot, this app (plus online access) suit all of my accounting needs. easy to follow after you've learned the basics, and love doing my monthly books while on the subway. has clients and books all in one place. helpful to see who owes money and to track income flows across each year. all the reports are fantastic. best accounting software out there, worth the investment imo.
app is changed for the worse. i am not sure when this happened, but the app is now useless and does not have the functionality it used to have. i now need to do everything on computer. not good.
awful app.. literally the worst business related app that i have to deal with. get ready to log in every six seconds and have no changes saved when you modify things. the idiotic data entry fields do not allow you to enter information half the time. if literally anyone anywhere came up with a program that would import my contacts and records from this steaming pile of junk, i would switch.
still no touch id. i used to think this was a great app, but now with these last 2 updates, i have to constantly uninstall the app and still no touch id. why when something works fine can you not just let it be.
poor functionality. constant crashes inability to complete selected tasks poor functionality this app try‚Äôs hard but doesn‚Äôt quiet make it with its functions. it didn‚Äôt at all shot me but that‚Äôs what the 3 day free trial is for. i wasn‚Äôt going to rate this app but after they charged me $10.50 for a 1 month subscription after i cancelled and deleted the app; i will rate it
missing function. we need a mileage tracking function in this app, not only to selfemployed version, to integrate all the expenses within quickbooks.
bad customer service and bad app. i‚Äôm use only one month is the most terrible app. never used this app
good program. been using this software for about 6 months now and find it very useful as a sole trader it works for me i can pick up my phone and write an invoice straight away.
a changing life app. i‚Äôm new to the u.s and this app helps a lot to get organized. just love it.
awesome. great program
good app. no complains
easy to use!. love the app!
disappointing. seemed a great idea  since the mobile website has serious limitations through safari. but the functionality of this is quite pathetic. no p&l. no balance sheet  even for limited periods of recent time. pretty much it's a list of journalregister activity. basically useless for me. i hope others find something valuable.
matt aka 'the killer'. works for simple accounting, works for me
small business asset. easy way to keep track off all those expenses, invoices, payments etc for a small business owner with little time to spend on administrative stuff.
annoyed again!!. i did the latest update and now i can‚Äôt even open this damm app! terrific ay! any suggestions qb‚Äôs!? can you get this sorted asap. a few updates prior to this lasted one, after that particular update all my company details except my abn disappeared, why? the app didn‚Äôt seem to save my details properly as i added them and it was like that until the following update. then everything was back to normal. pretty annoying!!
game changer. been using the desktop version for over a decade. now that i‚Äôm using qbo along with the mobile app i feel like i have been living in the dark ages! this is simple, useful, powerful and most importantly convenient! no more keeping up with paper receipts and forgetting to keep track of purchases.
mobile app for online qbb has problems. today has been particularly difficult when an invoice won't save. quickbooks tells me it is safe in the cloud, but it never is. now i keep getting a message on my ipad that my log in has expired, even though i just logged in. please fix this stuff. quickbooks is great when it works,
owner. i actually have never written a review for an app, and i've had an every iphone since the 3gs, i read the first review for this app and was so disgusted at the panning i just had to write one in support. i have a small business and use this every day! it's great, well designed and very user friendly. i run a carpet cleaning company and run basically every part of my business with this app.
keeps crashing. for the most part, the apps work pretty well. however, for whatever reason the app on my iphone crashes every time i login the first time. it gives me an error saying critical error please sign out. most the time when i sign back it, it‚Äôs ok after that. but usually requires restarting the app.
impressive for mobile. i posted a bad review because of some bugs. i received an immediate response about upcoming updates and a week later it was fixed. i love that level of support. nice app too.
highly recommend this app. i have a mobile veterinary service and use this for all of my billing while i'm on the road. it saves me time by allowing me to bill my clients on site at the time of service, and even process the credit card if they choose to pay that way.
amazing. great app. changed my life and vastly helped with my business. very smart and useful program. highly recommend!
works well. great app, easy to see what's going on at a glance
great for billing while traveling. this app is very hearty. i was worried how it would work from the ipad but it was so easy. let's me bill while i'm on the road so that i can keep my cash flow in order. great job, inuit!
great app. i am enjoying staying on top of things while on the go.
no security with ios 13.0 update.. nice to have the app working again .. too bad it opens without the required password. shoddy update.
can‚Äôt imagine life before qbo. seriously, how did business owners manage before qbo? keep up the great work.
very good and getting better!. qbo has been a great addition to our company and has many great features over qb desktop. there are some bugs to work out but i'm very happy so far with the online application.
great for my small business. integrates well with my online booking app and square reader. helps me to stay organized, spend less time doing administrative duties and more time to focus on what i love to do.
crashes. constantly crashes and doesnt work as promised.
simply slow. i talked to 300 people and they all say it‚Äôs just the program itself
best app ever. love quickbooks online.... easiest way to keep all my accounts and expenses in order.
not detailed enough. if they're going to let you invoice from the ipad, you should be able to enterchange and see all the fields that you can from a desktop the way you have set up your invoice format. i travel often and need to invoice from the road but can't send invoices the way they need to look  can't change ship to, can't use personalized fields. very disappointed in this app.
crashes upon opening. do not install. keep your prior version until they fix this. upon updating the app no longer will open. i called quickbooks and they said it must be a known issue then.
worse and worse with every update.. the more recent the update, the worse this app runs. worked great until they changed to a new platform and now it's slower then ever. to logging in or saving pictures out in the field, it takes an additional 20 mins on the job site just waiting for quickbooks.
fantastic app. the best bookkeeping app available. love this app. my bookkeeping has never been so up to date.
excellent tool for my biz. since i got this app on my phone i hardly need to go to the office, or open my laptop. love it!
not working with ios 13. just crashes
great app but. we need to have the ability to track mileage within the online version. also need to be able to auto fill a lot of data over to turbotax and allow it to do personal property taxes. i think the cost of this service is high for compared to the desktop version of which you can do more with. please work on the updates and continue to offer a great product.
new business.. very user friendly. almost like apple designed it. very unhappy that the email function doesn‚Äôt work. many people have complained for over a year and quickbooks still hasn‚Äôt offered a fixüò†. i have to take a screenshot and copy and paste to my email. not as professional looking, but gets the job done. that one glitch took away two stars because i can‚Äôt use my mobile phone to give someone an invoice or estimate.
new app is great!. the new app is super user friendly and versatile. it‚Äôs easier to use quickbooks from my phone than it is from my pc now. vast improvement over the previous versions.
somewhat useful, but ui stinks. if you're using this app in conjunction with the desktop version, you're best bet is to bring your laptop rather than you're ipad while you're on the go. the ui totally stinks, looks and feels nothing like what you're used to. my expectation was that i could replace the laptop while on the go and use the ipad app, needless to say i carry both because this app stinks.
user friendly but not without fault. works nicely. has a few issues. the receipt camera assist is terrible. the phone version is user friendly but very slow. overall gets the job done, as long as you have time and patience...
good. nice useful applications
i like everything but..... i like qbo a lot. however there is at least one very big flaw and that is that you cannot make past due or partial tax payments through qbo.
great app. nothing like doing invoices from the phone!
changed my life for the (much) better!. want to send an estimate in the time that it takes your barista to make your coffee? the amount of time that i save managing my business on my phone has cut my desktime in half. i couldn't be happier!
great app. this app  software really saves my life.
subscription renewal poorly thought out. i have been using qbonline for more than a year. it picked the worst time to time out and demand a subscription renewal. further it requires multiple logins and you must be st your desk top. nothing more frustrating than what amounts to a software crash when you are trying to get things done. huge fail quickbooks
i love this app. i love been able to do my work on the go, and quick book helps me do that
not just yet..... still have to enter my password every time i open the app. touch id or app pin don't work. ipad and iphone data isn't identical. this is so annoying.... especially in front of customers!! tired of wasting my time. update: deleted the app and reinstalled it to see if that made a difference. touch id works for now. will update after some use. bumped from 2stars to 3stars. update same day: already back to manually enter in in password. 2 stars.
not that good. only useful if you want to look something up quick as it is missing tons of features from the desktop site. will be using it no problem for a few minutes then it will log me out and ask for my password all over again.
horrible. crashes every time. horrible customer service. move on to another app.
qbo and this app two thumbs down.. how does such a large company make such a crappy product. basic logical steps can‚Äôt be completed. you go to summit a improvement and tons of people have listed the same things and nothing ever gets fixed. the app jumps back and forth between web view and app view. support is horrible. you can‚Äôt even move different parts of the invoice or estimate around in the app. switching to zoho
app times out occasionally during entry. app times out occasionally while i‚Äôm using it. when that happens it deletes the transaction i was working with.
not good. it doesn't give access to all qb online features. i have to sign in online anyway. lots of error messages.
brilliant. used other software apps before now and this one knocks socks off them, can access all my account details and add bills and send invoices so much easier during the day now, knocks about 30minutes a night off my admin
a good idea but not very useful yet. there is not access to the important online reports. there is no access to fx transactions or accounts in a foreign currency. i live overseas and bill my clients in us dollars and as such have no access to client information or us dollars sales and accounts. if the app mirrored the online program it would be great but it doesnt!!
no recurring transactions. why the hell would you make an app if it can't do any thing but read. i want to edit recurring transactions; edit and send invoices; and see every report. this is absolutely stupid, just sign in from a browser.
outdated. the iphone app is way better and has more features including hours and quantity in invoicing. this app really needs updating
easy. i have found this app very easy to use. being able to tap into your invoicing system when out on a job. it enables me to issue an invoice same moment the job is finished and emailed to my customer stood in front of me, that way my customer has a paperless invoice and can pay you right away. saves time!
quickbooksjoist sync. none of this is working at all. for a company that does bookkeeping it‚Äôs ironic that i‚Äôve been charged twice in less than thirty days for a trial period!! none of my invoices are synced, estinates are counted as revenue and quikboojs is stating my 90 day old business has 1000 net profit!! not even remotely possible! this is incredibly frustrating and so i have to work on this on my only day to rest. ridiculous!! do not use this app
unable to signin. since the update, qb won't authenticate on iphone 5s: either it states technical difficulties or the login info is incorrect. i'll uninstall and install to see if that resolves this new programming error.
so far so good.. love the app. i think it's great any time i can give an estimate, invoice on the road. thanks.
unusable after new update. virtually unusable after new update. worked well before that.
as large a company as intuit is, where's the support?. i can't imagine that as large of a company as intuitquickbooks is that they can't fix these constant issues with this app. it's been working ok until this last update. i have to physically go to the help section and hit the refresh button for sales receipts to show received after i enter them. and as everyone else has pointed out, touchid is no longer working.
fantastic. it's so handy to have quick books with me wherever i go! i can balance my bank register, create invoices and take payments on the go.
dirty tactics for subscription. unsubscribing to this app is so difficult. an error prompt always appears everytime i process unsubscribing. but if it‚Äôs any form of purchase, upgrading, downgrading, anything other than unsubscribing works just fine. no reply from their customer service since i contacted them a few weeks ago. i hope other people who has the same problems with this app comes forward so this developer stops milking money from unwilling customers.
i like it. i have enjoyed using this app for the last year. i am blind and it is 99% accessible with my screen reader, voiceover. i only want to report one error. the last update causes the app to crash when trying to edit an expense entry my accountant manages my quickbooks online account, however, when i find an incorrect category has been applied, i cannot fix it. the app crashes when i attempt
great business program. great program and user friendly! dont like that get charged everytime payments recieved online it becomes very costly as it adds up think this is wrong and hard enough on a business owner but overall best program to run small business or any business
co owner. we opened a small furniture and decor store. we use quickbooks online with few problems, however the go payments part was terrible. on our opening day it couldn't process 5 credit card transactions and has been sporadic ever since. we bought a new i pad hoping the faster processor would help wrong.
disappointed. although it loaded up ok, it didn't refresh my data that i had added online. i emailed support who are supposed to reply in 24 hrs but never heard anything. so unless they get this sorted it's going to be deleted.
good program. as a small business quickbooks online works great for me. being able to access all of my business information from all my devices is awesome!
useless. app is slow and hard to use.
wonderful app for freelancers. likes: stores repeat client info  allows for cc payment  allows me to include my company logo and information on each invoice.  alerts me of tardy invoices  provides me with easy to read charts and measure each months incomeexpenses dislikes:  credit card payments incurs a hefty fee rather than a monthly charge  all of my invoices have an intuit logo  customer service is not great
excellent once setup. i run my whole business on quickbooks. it was a little tricky to set up initially but once my bookkeeper had given it the once over, everything was perfect. great stock management system that ties in to the invoices and hooks in with the business bank account. this makes self assessments etc very easy and saves loads of time. very happy :)
login. i am not able to login.
excellent for the it service provider. as an it service provider, this app allows me to log my hours and mileage in the field. i can even email customer invoices immediately after services are performed. this is, of course, paired with quickbooks online plus, which allows you to log hours per customer. highly recommended!!
great app. i love using quickbook on my phone. very easy to access and a quick way to send my clients invoice and get a signature! i'm definitely paying for this! it's the best app i could have downloaded to take care of business! üíØüíØ
does what i need. app is easy to navigate and has all functionality i am looking for.
getting better with every upgrade.. great app. they do lure you with the free use then hit ya with the charges later. i think it's a useful tool in the toolbox.
good app. app does what it says it will do!
"not as good as it was.. getting worse. incorrect allocation of funds to invoices. the mobile app doesn't allow expense entering anymore (""we're working on it""  november 16). yes, you can see invoices and forward from the phone, but wouldn't want to do anything else. come on qb, get your act together. u.k."
keep crashing. after last update keep crashing. new update came just an hour ago still same crash???!!!doesn‚Äôt launch the app please fix asap
qb app is useless. i‚Äôve been quickbooks user for a long time and discovered this app gives a totally different set of numbers than quickbooks online does. expenses are different than real version so please beware, you can‚Äôt trust the numbers. contacted support to no avail. i guess they don‚Äôt read the other reviews either.
qb makes me look good. qb app is fantastic. i can write and present an estimate right at the job site or give my customer an invoice, or accept payment. in brief....it makes me look good!
if you‚Äôre serious about your business.... if you‚Äôre serious about being a business person in the modern era, get familiar with quickbooks and other intuit products. well worth the subscription.
nothing works for me. nothing works for me with this app. if i login using desktop, qbo is ok but when i use the app, there is no information; no clients, no invoices, nothing. the subscription says i have a free trial until 2037. phone support was unsuccessful.
warning: don't update to ios9.. force closes when getting signatures. software is not updated and ready for new update.
slow to respond from time to time .. the app is sometimes slow to respond.
crashes a ton. this is a great app for bookkeeping for my business, but it crashes almost daily on my iphone. please get better engineers for the functionality of this app!! so frustrating when i‚Äôm in the middle of printing invoices and the app crashes! how am i supposed to conduct business that way!?!
love!!. the quickbooks app is absolutely perfect! when handling business on the go and clients are making payments, i can easily create an invoice andor sales receipt. makes my job easier. it tracks all of our business expenses, profits and losses. this is great!
roofing company. the app is great, although it needs an update with bugs fixed. the app won't allow me to modify, save or send invoices. very frustrating.
last update killed this app. tiny bit better. i can't even.... will wait for the next update g to then i can't use it. after update today it works better. still not working right makes me log in every new session.
not working properly after update #2. people have businesses to run!! i understand glitches from freecheap apps. not something that costs $360year. my books don't match from my phone to my computer. the pin still doesn't work, every time i edited an invoice it magically created a copy of an invoice that showed up 2 days later. now i have a ton of clean up to do in my books. it's time for me to find new accounting software.
convenient but you pay for it. this app is really handy but they jack the prices up on you once you‚Äôve gone through all the hassle of inputting your info. they know you won‚Äôt probably mess with changing programs once you‚Äôve wasted all that time and energy. it is nice to use, however.
super & excellent apps. very user friendly application . i would recommend this software to other people
super. id√©ale pour les entreprises de services √©tant souvent hors du bureau. facile d'utilisation et tr√®s complet. accessible via pc, mac, iphone, ipad et sous andro√Øde √©galement. quickbooks en ligne est tout simplement g√©nial.
useless app for working in qbo. only found 2 reports available through the app. can‚Äôt ‚Äúdrill‚Äù into figures on the 2 reports provided. cannot access expenses on coa can‚Äôt really get any work done.
review. probably should have rated it 5 as i‚Äôm not completely up to speed on all functionality.... issues note reconciling accounts and getting the input in the correct bucket and data transfer from desktop not a crisp as it should be.
needs to fix bugs. i love quickbooks online and the desktop version but their mobile app needs to fix their bugs. i told quickbooks support two months ago that i couldn't email an invoice from the app and they couldn't help me fix the problem then. i still cannot send invoices from my mobile app so it is basically useless to me.
small electrical business. this software is perfect for anyone starting a business. it keeps everything organized from billing to customer records.
signature issues. the app crashes every time i get a signature or it doesn't save the signature. please resolve this issue
great product. great program for my small hvac business. and as they go they seems to be fixing bugs and issues
app is lacking. while i really like the online version of quickbooks on the desktop, the online app is definitely lacking. i can't check my check register. no reports. just not useful without this.
management. good online on the go, but it has too many breakdowns, constantly has crashes, and makes it frustrating when you needed, if there were another online app that i will use i probably would consider on changing, for something simple is probably the right one for many customer that used the app.
still needs some changes. multiple addresses for a company is still a drama as it changes all previous invoices and quotes. plus ipad app continually won't save edited quotes. have to use desktop version to edit invoices or quotes successfully. annoying!
features are good but i always found bugs. errors everywhere
doesn‚Äôt work like the app on a pc. the fact that the apps are not the same on a pc than on the ipad or mobile is frustrating. can‚Äôt see running totals on the register, can‚Äôt add transactions the same way, etc. and the kicker is the website version doesn‚Äôt work at all on the ipad, can‚Äôt scroll through the register because scroll bars are absent in chrome or safari. horrible adaptation and makes the ipad useless to conduct accounting business with quickbooks...
scope for lots of improvement. given that this app has been out for many years, it seems like it has been neglected. the interface shows it. for example, if we touch a vendor, only the address shows up and nothing else. ideally, all details related to the vendor have to be displayed  po, bills and payments. many such improvements can be done.
user friendly. quickbooks has saved me so much time and stress! i have a small business and tried excel and failed miserably. but when i switched to quickbooks it took me no time to figure out it could do everything i needed and more! also the customer service is wonderful, anytime i have called for help because i'm terrible at technology they walk me through step by step without making me feel stupid. i'm so happy i switched to quickbooks!!!
info problem. at first i absolutely loved quickbooks. but for the past 3 weeks it has been unable to load any of my data which is very disappointing.
nice app!. suits my needs...
has potential. i'm not i fully understand why quickbooks is the worlds leading software for small business accounting. i'm dying for customizations for my invoices and estimates. these updates should work like a wysiwyg editor; immediate updates. desperately need more room for customizations on the invoices as well; they look like they are from 1995. the mobile app is ok, could be great. some things are not where you expect them to be but i guess i just have to learn that.
overall pretty good. overall i'm pretty satisfied with the app. my one major complaint though is that it doesn't support third party keyboards. so when writing invoices or estimates on my phone i can't use my swipe keyboard which i've gotten very use to using as my primary way of typing. it is to allow third party keyboards, but then they took it away. it would be nice to see this return.
love qbo it's fantastic.. this app rocks. i can see they are adding more features.
magnifico. aplicativo e software excelente! vale muito o investimento!
great app but expensive. at $30month it‚Äôs expensive. now that they‚Äôre raising it to $40, i‚Äôm starting to question my choices..
keeps crashing. app doesn‚Äôt work . no updates in months
crashing after ios13 update!. app is crashing after face id log in on xs max ios13
great app. great mobile app. only gripe is i wish they would integrate bill pay. other than that, solid app.
smallbusiness rocket!. great app. this is making my small business very productive. especially since the account is device agnostic. i can use it on my device or login online and be just as efficient.
great app. what a great app and ease of access across all platforms.
it's glitchy!. although it fulfills the need of having the ability to create estimates on the spot and resend invoices quickly, it has glitches which are frustrating. on occasion it stalls and goes out of the app requiring you to log on several times and even restart your phone before be able to access the app.
very easy and convenient!. i love having the mobile app. it makes it easy to enter transactions on the spot without having to stop and open up my computer to login.
please repair!. its a excelent, but in 1 mounth are problem to connect in sometimes!! i have problem to connect to app in my iphone and a need for my business, that is terrible problem.
love tracking expenses.. being able to expenses right at the gas pump just makes sense. taking photos of receipts just makes things easier i wish i would've left the desktop app a while ago.
small business owner. absolutely awful. i was forced to switch to online because of a fatal error of the desktop version on mac seirra. there are so many bugs and things that aren't available on online that were on the desktop. i literally call support for 2hrs a day.
no bad. there are several things that are better with the app and qb's online, however the lack of personalisation with the invoicing are rather pants and why the system doesn't have a clocking in facility for employees yet is beyond me could be done easily through a simple app and gps no?? and then integrated into job sheets
awesome!. fantastic app. as a freelancer i am often away from my office. being able to create estimates and have my clients sign them on the spot has been great. and being able to send invoices from anywhere has absolutely changed my life! love it.
crashes often. this app goes from being usable to worthless on a whim.
very limited functionality. this might be worthwhile if you need to issue invoices on the go, but that's about it. you can't manage expenses, checks, etc. no reports. very limited functionality. it's good if i need to look up a payment i made and already imported through my pc version.
buggy app. doesn‚Äôt even open, tried many times opening it on my iphone x for weeks. it doesn‚Äôt even open the app and there hasn‚Äôt been an update to fix that for ages. unable to use it on my phone and having to use it on my laptop which i don‚Äôt always have it on hand. please fix this issue.
good functionality but slow to load. great functionality, good app but it takes too long to load. i don't need the homescreen with current activity to load each time. i just want to add an invoice.
great app!. really handy to be able to use my phone to raise invoices or make them as paid when i check my internet banking on my phone too.
poor. slow, clumsy. there are far better apps on the market. don't waste your money.
horrible. please update this app so it stops crashing during every use!!! also, critical updates every time you try and do anything???? getting old and frustrating. fix it!!!!! also, why when you update a transaction, it saves it from before the update, so you are doing the work twice???
too slow. too slow, freezes, doesn't show if the email has been sent and other things... quick sale is way better.
convenient app for my accounting on the go. love the user friendly interface and convenience of upkeeping my accounts anytime anywhere
awful. slow, takes ages to load photos, can only load one photo at a time. constant errors where the invoice will be paid twice
crashing constantly. crashes nonstop. i get two entries in and then crash. sick of it. come on intuit.
great app, easy enough to use!. app is easy enough to use, even as a noob.
app is not functional. the app is keep crushing on iphone xs max every time you i want to create new invoice. billion dollar company but cannot fix bugs for a few months already, its embarrassing.
favorite app. my favorite app. i use it on a daily biases to send invoices right after i complete a job. makes my life so much less stressful.
intuit keeps working it but stumbles on occasion. i've been a qbo user for over 4 years now and run my whole oneman business on it. each app version is a bit better than the last and they do fix bugs when notified. i continue to be happy to see intuit continue to improve the app and the web interface. the blanking of bank account data in the dashboard appears to be fixed in v5.3.
barely useable. it's a great idea, but too many features of the online version are not accessible on the app. perhaps the qb folks are working on upgrades
fantastic app for my ipad pro!. i recently acquired an ipad pro to use for my business and instantly downloaded quickbooks to use on the go. this app has been wonderful for sending invoices, logging my expenses, and managing the books in general. so far, i have yet to experience a crash and everything has been working well for my needs!
some good features but limited and pricey.. search features are extremely limited. find an invoice using customer po number? can't. essentially, to find something you have to already know where it is. data differs from desktop version sometimes. only 2 generic reports available in mobile app. disappointing functionality considering the qb online monthly fees!
sorely disappointed. intuit made good products maybe even great products at one time. now their cloud offerings a just released with out any concern for features and bugs. disappointed. somebody has gotten to big to care about their customers.
does not function. doesn't load new invoices. app is now useless.
not reliable on weekends or holidays. times when i have to work on weekends or holidays i have the most issues logging in and being able to invoice customers. there is also times when i can‚Äôt login during the week, i‚Äôm guessing due to quickbooks working on servers! wish i could install as a program on my tablet instead of a app or still be able to use offline to print an invoice and receipt
app crashes constantly. i used to love this app. the last couple of months the app crashes daily and multiple times. i‚Äôm in the middle of working and the app says critical updates are needed and logs me out. i‚Äôm extremely frustrated with this considering i pay over $20month to use this software across all my devices.
fantastic app for my ipad pro!. i recently acquired an ipad pro to use for my business and instantly downloaded quickbooks to use on the go. this app has been wonderful for sending invoices, logging my expenses, and managing the books in general. so far, i have yet to experience a crash and everything has been working well for my needs!
class reporting is needed badly for the app. without class reporting this app doesn't provide a lot of use for someone with multiple locations.
easy to use, powerful, brilliant. managing everything on the run is important... with quickbooks i can do pretty much everything i need from my mobile saving me valuable time! only thing i would request is an apple watch app.
mjm quality construction. great app. i can work from anywhere with internet connection.
works well so far. i installed the app this month. so far it allows me the flexibility to record transactions on the go. this is a big help.
log in feature.. new version requires you to log in each day, while this may not sound horrible, this app was created for ease of use. previous versions required you to log in once, then your finger print or 4 digit passcode would suffice. please bring that back.
love this app. as a small business contractor, i find this app very useful and an asset to our company. especially when we are on the go, and need to send something over to a customer or view what we've done prior. when i don't have my desktop available to me, this is definitely where i go. one click wonders of converting one document to the next.
great app!. it's clear they've put a lot of thought into the experience here. smooth ui and they keep adding features. thank you!
new update is amazing. incredibly user friendly with additions of dashboards
love it!. great mobile online app tool that syncs with your online quickbooks on both mac and pcs.
rockin. full throttle on the go. just buy it, you want regret it.
"so frustrating. ""updated"" the app... telling me now that i need a new version of the app and since i already have it, not sure what i'm supposed to do. even my accountant agrees quickbooks online is too confusing. waiting for 2016 to close out my books and use a new program."
works fine for me. i'm not having any problems on my iphone or ipad. overall, it works very well. love the ability to snap pics of my expense receipts on the go. huge time saver and i don't forget! on another note, i do wish intuit would develop a mileage tracker.
bon d√©but, good start!. the online qb 2014 interface is a big wow! but this one is not yet reaching the expectations, it¬¥s a good beginning, bon d√©but. when do you add french and spanish languages?
quick books. the best app ever, easy to use, never had an issue that could not be easily resolved. i run 2 nyc businesses and mostly on the run.
more than convenient, it's necessary. having the app makes it so much easier to do business on the go. you can send estimates and invoices before the client meeting has even ended. efficient and essential!
very good!. very flexible product. love the mobile application. would like more canned reports and the ability to print weekly time sheets. overall a 9 out of 10.
incredible. totally simplified my accounting.. i switched from sage to qbo and have not looked back. easy to setup and learn. can send invoices from my phone in seconds. i recommend it to everyone i know!!
simply, beautifully... brilliant. i've no need to log in via the laptop until the end of the month... the fact that i can capture, create but also review my expenses, my p&l and notes is simply brilliant.
favorite app. my favorite app. i use it on a daily biases to send invoices right after i complete a job. makes my life so much less stressful.
a really great app. quick books is pretty much all you could ask for when running a small business. it's online so all information and invoices are accessible from any device with internet. great customisable options. only minor thing is its interface is slightly more complex than other appsprograms but once you know your way around your fine.
love it. but one thing is missing. i have a lot of customers who prepay for their dog waking services. trying to roll over store credit is more difficult than anticipated with this app. that is the one and only negative i have. not big enough of an issue to make me not want to use this app. i love it overall.
excellent program. we are extremely happy with this program, it has made our company administrators live so much easier.
good but could be better. many features that are online, you cannot use in the app. even the online version is limited.
owner. thank you for qbo! it's a breeze to use and i love recommending it to my clients! can't wait to get updates and see what else qbo can do.
it's only a trial. this looks brilliant until you've set up the account only to find out that it's a 30 trial. by that time they've got your email. well done them. clever!! immediately deleted
lacking. app is seriously lacking in functionality. don‚Äôt buy quickbooks online unless you plan to do most of your work from a desktop. kind of defeats the purpose. way overpriced and they keep raising the price too :( wish i had stuck with the quickbooks pro platform.
app constantly glitches and it's very slow. i've had so many issues with this app. lately it has been extremely slow, it randomly shuts down for no reason in the middle of inputting a transaction and it won't load larger invoices. i'm very disappointed as i use this on a daily basis for my business.
love it. i am an accountant and this is the software i use and recommend to all of my customers.
no more ios 8 support. disappointed that app developers are dropping ios8 support. not everyone upgrades the second apple comes out with a new ios
bad update. befoe you used to record bank feed but no more! this update ruined the quickbooks app
looks great!!!. keep the updates coming! great job of being quick to update the app and user interface and continuing to add great features!
unable to login. trying to login on iphone from my user & password but unfortunately unable to do. the same user & password is working proper on my pc. kindly resolve the said issue at the earliest. thanks.
excellent app. helpful reports and nice review of recent transactions to make sure operations are in tact.
electrical contracting business. very easy and convenient to use. my accountant can log on to it from her office saving me the time and the trip. i appreciate the phone app especially for unexpected service calls.
love it. i'm no doing anything super sophisticated but i love the app. easy to use to keep invoices and expenses current on the go!
"app good but needs better features. the application is fairly reliable. there are many features such as ""shipping date"" and special fields not accessible from ios devices which make the app less useful than it should be. also, since the new chip credit card reader came out, it is still incompatible for payments in quickbooks. good but should be better. it is a great product for real time customer service but has a way to go before being excellent."
modern and simple. i am happy i made my final choice on accounting software to be quickbooks online and then having this app to accompany it. as others have already said, it needs to have more access to the other accounting features that come with the full online package but i'm hoping for more updates.
works perfect. i enjoy using qb it allows me to send invoices from where ever i'm at also i can except payments from the field. it's been awesome to run my small business for 2 years.
really good !. used a different invoicing program for years but would not sync with quickbooks. so i went over to the best and figuring it out. quickbooks online has made it easy to work through. good job developers !! been 8 months now and have to say quickbooks online has been excellent ! not too hard to learn and very easy for my customers. a winwin
great app but needs improvement. there are various things you can‚Äôt do on app .example you can‚Äôt set recurring transaction, use batch actions for reminders. for indian users , they have not launched quickbooks payment. there is no customer portal ,there should be system for sending invoice and reminder link via sms overall it is good app and all does the basic stuff but should look forward to integrate above stuff as well
very beneficial app. this is a very beneficial app. it does not replace the pc version but is an excellent aid. it's helpful to send invoices on the go or at the end of a service call. the sooner the customer pays the more chance you will get paid. as long as you keep things simple it is a very good aid!
doesn‚Äôt always work. says it can‚Äôt show details on invoices. annoying.
wecan. easy to use on the go.
easy. it could be a little bit easy to use.... invoices could be customized to add options like hours....
nice tool for how i use qbo. i keep books for a couple of pool service companies. they often have questions while in the field. this works great for answering while on the go. i wouldn't want to work only with mobile, but very helpful
great app if it worked.. this app was really promising at first, but now it seems like i consistently have issues with chase bank accounts and american express accounts updating. it‚Äôs monday and sine thursday my alchase accounts say they are updated when they are not and my amex continuously has error connections. and then u call customer service and they ask you if you called amex to see why there was a connection problem. a shame.
getting better. you can keep doing more and more on phone. great for us small business owners. it would be 5 but when i first downloaded there was not a lot to transactions you could complete on app.
do not use mobile to create your account. lost all our data on our old account because apparently if you first sign up using ios you absolutely cannot continue the subscription using your computer. had to just make a new account. you also can‚Äôt access any of the profile from the computer once the subscription runs out so i wasn‚Äôt able to download and save any of the data either. do not use mobile to create yor account.
best alternative for mac users. my accountant wouldn't work with the mac version 2013, so he suggested we use quickbooks online. having the ability to manage the business from anywhere, on any mac or idevice, is a game changer!
good app, a bit expensive to upgrade. good app, but a bit expensive to upgrade. it holds me back from doing it
cornered into online version. not an easy transition from desktop for contractor version. poor interface for entering time to bill for. hard to tell what time and materials i have not billed for. mobile interface is fairly limited.
intuitive. qb does a great job with the app. easy to understand if you use qb online.
great app. being able to use quickbooks on my phone has really helped my business run more efficiently. i'm able to manage customers and employees all from my phone.
easy to use. this app is so quick and easy. my business is on the go all of the time and it makes estimates and invoicing so quick and easy.
app crashes constantly. i used to love this app. the last couple of months the app crashes daily and multiple times. i‚Äôm in the middle of working and the app says critical updates are needed and logs me out. i‚Äôm extremely frustrated with this considering i pay over $20month to use this software across all my devices.
qbooks online. the windows version is pretty decent but the mobile app is horrible. the invoicing option is not that great. i give it 2 star just because it is accessible from every where.
easy of use. i think the app will be great once i figure out how it works.
lacks a lot of usefulness. this app is pretty good but misses a lot of the functionality that you would hope to have. it can only run a few of the reports and can only assign some of the expenses in the banking features. the app continues to get better, just wish it made the big leap.
qb app no good!!!. quickbook online is fine where as the app has only limited features!!!
nice app. this is a really good app and i would give it five stars except i keep getting an error message when opening up certain accounts from the chart of accounts.
great program. great program for businesses. great for on the go!
yes! it crashed. sept. 26 it crashed. customer service new nothing about it the 29th. i have a 5. are you forcing me to upgrade?
great app. yet again another update and even more glitches, you charge a fortune and cannot provide a decent service  i‚Äôm considering switching to a competitor as you have breached the contract that you have with me. this needs fixing urgently and you need to refund subscription fees! my advice to businesses and the selfemployed is do not use quickbooks!
been a lifelong customer. been with qb's for as long as i've own my own business, they have grown with my continuous expanding company needs and highly recommend them. one request would be to be able to view salesreports on my iphone if it would be possible.
tried xero and qbo, stuck with qbo. i launched my law firm a few years ago, and went back and forth about which accounting software to use. i tried both xero and qb, and settled on qb, because of: built in payment processing  more intuitive layout  easier to understand tools, for non accountants. i'd love to to see the mobile version incorporate some of the web version's ui, but i'm otherwise quite happy.
doesn't work properly!!!!!. doesn't work properly!!!!! you should fix all bugs before u sell your service, especially then it's about money and business, stay away if u want save you time!!!
so far so good üëçüèªüòÉ. software is straight forward and easy to use and if you are unsure, the support team explain everything.
it's scam don't download 19.99 per month they took from my account. i just did download almost 8 month ago this app they took from my account almost 19.99 per month after cancel also they are robbing very bad don't download at all even no customer service to help you to talk also bad bad super bad
annoying but useful. 1. there is no dashboard 2. have to reenter your password every couple of days 3. the only report you can view is p&l. no other reports are available (e.g. ageing, unpaid invoices, customer unpaid, etc.)
good app!. add travel tracking to app
very limited functionality. the app has very limited functionality  i can‚Äôt even see the purchase ledger on the app never mind post invoices or take photos of them. lists supplier contact information only, not even account balances. useless. i have to log on to full site and try to navigate around it on phone screen which is difficult. oh and by the way, very unhelpful customer service too!
app crashes. this app crashes or cannot save my data on every entry i make. horrible app!!
great but has a long way to go. was so excited to migrate to qbo but now that i'm here, there are so much important elements that are not here  bills payment stub or remittance advise doesnt even have a reference or a check #.
very satisfied!. been using the mobile app for the past 2 months now, and i can say it does everything i need. very easy to issue invoices, receive the money, match, reconcile the bank, calculate the vat! the support people are very helpful and have a lot of patience!
clean and wonderful app. we love qb for i pad.
superb. this accounting system and the app have saved me so much time over the last six months. i used to dread calculating the vat return and catchup my up on the books but i am up to date daily with very little effort. well worth the money!
still needs some changes. great program when it connects and saves correctly. constantly crashes or cannot save work. you have to close app retry. most of the time loosing the invoice or quote you've created. needs addressing. this happens all the time on ipad app.
quickbooks lies again. this app does not track mileage as advertised
super efficient. this app has streamlined my workflow 100%
i can use my phone and ipad!. had the desktop version for years and loved it! always updated every couple of years and learned the new changes. then went to online version, little less features but was more mobile. now i have it at the office, or anywhere! some features are still a work in progress  like receiving payments, but this quickbooks team has been developing and updating since the beginning. great accounting software!
awesome i just need to learn to use it. its awesome i love it but im new to it so i have a little bit of trouble using some of the features but im sure i will get the hang of it with time n experience
impressive for mobile. i posted a bad review because of some bugs. i received an immediate response about upcoming updates and a week later it was fixed. i love that level of support. nice app too.
user friendly but not without fault. works nicely. has a few issues. the receipt camera assist is terrible. the phone version is user friendly but very slow. overall gets the job done, as long as you have time and patience...
easy and convenient. so far start of the new trial and will definitely renew. very simple and easy to use. great how you can use the app or computer and it all updates quickly.
great app. loving it  i love keeping track of expenses on the go and how it syncs with quickbooks online.
it is ok. the mobile app is ok. limited access. really not much use to it except check your pl and entering transaction.
not very good. there seems to be issues here. a lot of errors with login on this updated app. as well as having to wait so long for funds to be deposited. not happy
quickbooks = easy bookkeepping. love the mobile app, very easy to use. access accounts from anywhere, raise invoices, pay invoices. simplified bookkeeping!!
great so far!. i am really glad we went with quickbooks online, as i love this app! being able to pull up any and all financial information as well as build and email estimates and invoices on the go is crucial to our business! thank you intuit!
great app. great app quick and easy to make estimates and invoices. would like for there to be more customization such as adding business information to show on them rather than just email address however overall is a great app very happy with it.
qb app liberates and empowers me. i use both the app and the online version to much satisfaction. the app lets me easily edit an invoice and see which invoice and recurring billing have been paid. i do use recurring billing yet i set that up via the online version at my computer. i can access my books on the go, and that is what i needed from the app.
can't match bank transactions reliably. the only reason i use this app is to match bank transactions when i have some 'down' minutes. lately, they keep getting kicked back to me, so i have to match them on my pc anyway. also, you don't have access to both memo and description, so your notes don't appear in reports if you add the transaction though a bank connection.
missing a lot... unless i missed it, there is nowhere that you can just add revenue. you have to add an invoice, and then apply a payment to that invoice. twostep process for a very simple thing. if i have a total sales report to add, it's not simple to do.... for a small business that receives sales income from a day at the farmer's market for example, this is not the app to use. add a revenue option!
great app for independent contractors. qb helps me stay on top of my invoices and keeps me organized.
great app for any small business. this is a well polished app with regular updates and new features being added everyday. *credit card transactions are incredibly simple with the intuit gopayment integration. great job on the app guys keep up the good work!
glitchy, incomplete features, and poor data. this app needs serious attention. after years of putting up with this hot mess i‚Äôm fed up and rarely use it any more. no matter what i do i can‚Äôt get data to load that is any more recent than 2016 for most vendors. no one from tech support replies  ever. american express transactions can‚Äôt be synched or approved in the app. about the only thing it‚Äôs useful for is matching typical transactions in our checking account.
works great!. i am a new business owner and i have qb online on my pc, ipad and iphone. it is great to be able to record expenses and take photos of the receipts right when it happens rather than waiting until later and possibly forgetting. no issues found so far!
boost to my business image with my ipad!. i went from handwriting every estimate, sales receipt and invoice to bringing in new paperless technology. at the end of the day i would have to have my wife input everything in our quick books online. then file everything in our office. it's not only impressive to our clients, but it also eliminates filing and an extra step of data entry, it saves time and money and gives you a competitive edge over your competition!
what happened?. this app used to work perfectly. after the last update i can't use it how i used too. if they do not fix it soon i am going to have to look into other options
waste of resources. so you have just put out an update saying how exciting that you have changed the layout and fonts... big whoop!! how about getting the program right first. as in the features that the web version do. bundled items can‚Äôt be seen or edited in the app you have to log into the web interface. etc etc. posting a premium rate per month yet you can‚Äôt add basic features. priority people!! oh wow a new font .... pfffft! :(
quick books. awsome app. helps when your always on the go.
great system easy to use. i really like the online version better than the windows. the app is easy to use i highly recommend this app quick books has completely changed the way i run my business. every thing is so organized and neat now. i don't lose recipes any more. witch is a plus the total functionality of the system is great.
good idea. i love the concept but i've had to reenter several expenses up to three times to get quickbooks to except them in and that's rather annoying.
handy for sole trader. some things aren‚Äôt available on the app, like editing your invoices.
love it!. so far the app is easy to navigate and i like using it.
needs tip option. please add tip option when customer signs credit card transaction like in go payment
great user interface. i like using quickbooks online because it is simple and effective. easy to use and uncluttered.
impressed.. very impressed with how far intuit has taken the qb online product, and this app is a nice extension of that! all the talk of cloud and mobile being the future..is now thanks to this cloud product. i refer many accountants in my network the qbo accountant version, which is the best solution for most small businesses in my opinion.
owner. i can't add attachments without it freezing. crashes constantly and touch id does not work
since last update app is glitchy. usually this app works great but since last update it has a couple glaring glitches that make it less then desirable to use.
covers everything. love qb love how you can work quick on the go as well, on the phone or ipad as well as computer. it can be overwhelming but customer service is always super helpful. just and over all great product.
excellent interface and convenient app. this app is a life saver and helps me run my small business affairs smoothly. i can submit my invoices and estimates on the go with ease. definitely a must app to have.
broken app. latest update broke it. app will no longer launch and immediately crashes. now looking at alternatives.
ease of use. being able to utilize the app on mobile has made billing my customers so much easier for my transport company. editing and immediately sending invoices for quick pay is a great option as well. i've been a quickbooks user for 20 years now and will likely not stop anytime soon.
great for small business. it's a great app for small business. since it's a cloud solution, cheap and easy to access your finances from any where. need improvement to have detailed views and reporting for the management.
awesome app!. great product, has everything our small business needs, saved us a lot of time transferring from one program to this. reconciliation is a dream, so simple and easy to work out. have had no issues whatsoever and am very happy with the change over, has made life so much easier. üëç thank you
doesn‚Äôt work with ios 13. keeps knocking me out.
great product. i couldn't be happier with this app is the best of the best, probably the purchase i ever done for my business
quickbooks. this app is excellent and the version on my computer is even better save's me hours when quoting well worth the money.
quickbooks online + app. quickbooks online is making my business accounts so easy. the bank connections feature allows you to sync online accounts straight into your account records. when new transactions are available, you can view and add them straight into your accounts, made easier by quicbooks match feature that marks transactions with previous similar transactions. support during setup period has been excellent which has made switching from another online accounting software quite an easy process. very impressive so far.
"confusing and cluttered app. i love that nearly all of the features in the desktop app are here in the mobile app. however the interface, especially the home page, is confusing and cluttered. ""company activity"" is a bit useless as the default page. show me the charts of paidunpaid invoices. i think the developers are tasked with including every single feature and that clouds their design judgement. it's not an easy ask but let's make this app more mobile friendly."
i'm a fan. i use this app almost daily now. was stuck on my computer and was not will to try it. but happy i did. joe i do accounting in the go. thanks quick books
covers everything. love qb love how you can work quick on the go as well, on the phone or ipad as well as computer. it can be overwhelming but customer service is always super helpful. just and over all great product.
some good features but limited and pricey.. search features are extremely limited. find an invoice using customer po number? can't. essentially, to find something you have to already know where it is. data differs from desktop version sometimes. only 2 generic reports available in mobile app. disappointing functionality considering the qb online monthly fees!
ran into unsupported transactions within 1 minute.. the app is difficult to navigate, bloated and slow, using a ton of wireless data. the app would be much better as multiple singlefunction apps. i mean, do i really need to log in to qb to snap a pic of a receipt and submit it for later? typical quickbooks bad experience. very disappointing.
"worse accounting program. you have to go through multiple screens for a simple tasks. there is functionality in the app that's not available in the desktop which is unusual for an accounting program. automation and ""how to"" help menus are nearly nonexistent."
iphone app is the worst. the iphone app doesn't work. their customer service people admitted it doesn't work. don't even try to use it  too frustrating and a big waste of time. online version and ipad versions are good but too limited for price  reports can't compare year over year
quickbooks. i have been using quickbooks for about 3 years. i use the ipad version and the quickbooks online version. it does almost everything i would need it to do. i am really liking this last update.
intuit. great app will be nice when we can scan bar codes on receipts
life saver!. i absolutely love this app. when i first started out and i didn't have that many funds in the bank, this was one expense i didn't even have to overthink. after using quickbooks online app for only a week i knew i could never go back to organizing my finances on my own. i use it every single day!
excellent. does what it says on the tin.. excellent app. works brilliantly on the ipad, sometimes find it a little sluggish on the iphone but i put that down to the poor wifi we sometimes have and bad signal from phone operator. anyways it's so easy to use and i can produce an invoice there and then and email to the client instantly. don't know why i took so long to move from desktop to quickbooks online.
a1 app. i love this app ! i'm using it all day !
newest update. loved the app until the newest update. now for some reason i can no longer receive payments from my phone. which is very frustrating. i have closed out the app, restarted my phone and still can't do it.
great app. very easy to use. reliable. every once in a while it has loading issues but it's rare.
highly recommend. as an accountant, i use quickbooks everyday on a variety of clients. i wouldn‚Äôt recommend any other software. the cloud based platform is ideal for ease of access and management.
the best. buy an ipad. shred up your paper estimatesinvoicing. stop using pens. download this app. holy crap i've been in business 4 years and feel stupid after downloading this. plus u look awesome w an ipad. plus everything's stored forever.
no ability to schedule an invoice. we need to be able to schedule invoice sending setting up reoccurring transactions is not a way around this. will give 5 stars if this feature is developed
does it work?. great app. keeps me well ordered and never lets me down
perfect app for any small business owner. as a qbo pro advisor my opinion may be somewhat biased but i can not brag enough about the software, customer support and resources offered by quickbooksintuit. qbo has allowed me to become a completely virtual bookkeeping firm, increasing my service area, customer satisfaction and turn around time. love love love them!!
ceo, bear island brewing co. i was hesitant to change the way i was doing things and use quickbooks when we switched to it a few years back. it has literally transformed how we do things in such a positive manner! i look back to how i used to do it and regret not making the switch sooner.
not working properly after update. people have businesses to run!! i understand glitches from freecheap apps. not something that costs $360year. why did you replace the pin with passcode? i don‚Äôt want to log into my iphone, ever. all i need secured is my qb app and the pin worked just fine for that. with this update i can login successfully once every 2030 attempts. intuit, test your updates before you release them!!!
fire the entire team. worst app. login doesn't work. recovery doesn't work. craptastic adventure
not quite what i'm looking for. after the invoice2go update disaster, i read a lot of good things about this app. sadly it fell short of expectation as i was unable to change the invoice number, which i would think was a pretty basic requirement. advice on the internet seems to relate to an older version of the app as the information did not relate to what was on the screen. i won't be utilising my free trial, nor will i be subscribing.
everything i need. qb is perfect for my small business needs. i tried myob and this is so much easier to use. easy to navigate or just get a snapshot
doesn't work for ipad. this app doesn't even load my company info. it keeps returning error trying to load company info. i have contacted quickbooks a number of times and all they say is they are working on the issue and to use a web browser version in the mean time. i have seen about 4 updates released and not one of them has fixed this issue. when will this be fixed?
doesn‚Äôt keep track of suppliers. this app works fine as long as you only want to send novices. unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt tell what you owe your suppliers and allow you to pay their bills, so while you are running around invoicing clients the suppliers will be sending the bailiffs round to your office.
slowly losing my business. i'm about tired of this app not functioning properly. embarrassing to say the least when i have a customer trying to pay their bill and i can't even connect to quickbooks online server. none of your apps are working as advertised. $25month for what again?
quickbooks  issues and problems. i thought this may be reputable like the brand. boy am i surprised. can't even call to get proper support. they think that a 48 hours turnaround on a request is acceptable these days...for your important accounting software. give others a look first, this online version is lacking what the desktop has.
fantastic. i love this app! it's very useful
pdf note on ipad. why can't we add a pdf note on ipad app. i can do it by accessing desktop version on ipad. but it's a pain doing it that way. it would be simpler to add that option to the app. come on guys keep up with the technology. quit lagging behind.
no payroll. subscribed to payroll using desktop at the office, tried to access using iphone app on the field but could not find it. waste of money!
"good but some issues with apple. users with the customersales limited access may have problems. 3 different apple phones used and same errors appearing. ""you do not have the rights to view this information."" no problems with androids"
life easier. i resisted quickbooks since the first time i used it years ago and it just didn't work for me. but now it's really easy to use except for a few things that the accountant will fix
40 min on hold with customer support. the app works fine, but 40 minutes on hold with customer support? not so much.
great app, easy to use!. this is a great financial management app. i'm far from an accountant but once you have your chart of accounts set up, keeping track of expenses and income is a breeze! a few swipes of your finger and you can reconcile your bank accounts. if only more things were this easy!
business made better. this has been a great experience. it has made billing especially easer and i'm getting paid sooner. two thumbs up. great tech support!!
intuit keeps working it but stumbles on occasion. i've been a qbo user for over 4 years now and run my whole oneman business on it. each app version is a bit better than the last and they do fix bugs when notified. i continue to be happy to see intuit continue to improve the app and the web interface. the blanking of bank account data in the dashboard appears to be fixed in v5.3.
meh. constantly making me sign out. constantly not updated with what‚Äôs online. constantly telling me i‚Äôve got outstanding invoices that have long. we. recorded online.
made to measure. this online accounting package fits like a glove. after using the desktop version for some years this is now streets ahead in terms of speed of accessibility, very user friendly with very good visibility of information on the home page and excellent tracking of sending, viewing and tracking emailed invoices. simple excellent for my purpose.
bad app! bad app!. i loved the app... then it fell apart. i cannot get it to show current status on anything! why is it so hard to keep a good app 'good' ??
unreliable. seems to have several issues when using apple products. macipad or phone.
best app for my business!. not a good app when it doesn't download your banking, nor did it make good invoicesestimates. i love invoicesasap, but this app needs help.
great but wish they‚Äôd bring back custom fields. the thing that set qbs apart was the ability to have custom fields and filter reports by them. the off the shelf fields aren‚Äôt enough for businesses that are highly specialized. custom memorizable fields and reports should be included in the online version but there‚Äôs only 3 of them and they are limited.
still needs work. not all features are equally accessible on pc, ipad or iphone, such as selecting different estimate and invoicing templates. most likely a bug and would love to see that fixed . the online version on the pc is slowwww
president. quickbooks is a fantastic app, it is easy to use and tracks everything i need and keeps all the information organized. would recommend to everyone
worthless. some functions don't work at all like banking. doesn't load account activity. it's so useless i have to use mobile web version.
great, but can learn from others. just my observations: mobile app should be mostly used to record expenses. it lacks ocr tracing. moreover scanning a receipt is a multistep process. should add forcetouch to add receipt (open in camera). invoices: been searching how to add my banking information. cannot believe quickbooks does not allow for adding banking information to invoices. did i miss something? or is it a hidden feature? not very intuitive (pun intended). otherwise good. like the integration with bank account.
very disappointing. very limited subset of the online product. the fact that i can't see all my normal reports makes no sense. and can't log in through the browser, so ipad is pretty useless tool for quickbooks. funny thing is that there is beta version for iphone that is more functional. wish it worked on ipad.
thumbs up for the business help!!!. take the time to go through the orioles and this is an amazing app to help with any small business!!!
missing too much functionality. basic features like looking at an account are missing. my chart of accounts are listed but clicking to view transactions says this account not viewable in the mobile app.
crashes. crashes during loading on ios 9. won't make it past log in screen. qb should have been prepared for the new ios release.
it's ok not super. i'd like to have the ability to creat checklists and forms that aren't effectively invoice like. i also don't like intuit screwing with their databases and allowing some invoices and expenses to go missing from my account.
app crashes ughhh. app crashes after you sign in. please fix!
must have accounting tool. i don't see how we managed without it before! everything is easy! the two factor authentication gives me a piece of mind. if you choose to use 2fa, then go with google authenticator and avoid the txt code. there are still problems with txt codes and you can get locked out. i figured a way around it on my own. unfortunately quickbooks was unable to help me with the lock out issue. other than that it's allll gooood!
it‚Äôs having to log in constantly. i‚Äôve been having a really problem with my ipad six generation lately, anytime i exit the app while writing up a quote and bounce backandforth between the information i need to enter into quickbooks. the app suffers a critical crash causing me to login several times with in an hour span. are there any bug fixes coming up? i suffer the same issue with my iphone xr and ipad pro.
love this app!. very easy and simple to use. i can instantly add details from job to job and also great for keeping track of what's going on in my company. thanks jdm auto detailing
no es para argentina. bien pero no pude incluir los bancos
qbooks is a entrepreneur's dream. i've been doing bussines as general contractor the last 20 yrs, always i tried to find a software where i can handle all my administrative information at all (invoicing, payroll, expenses) with this apps you can get everything at your fingers reach, so you can control all money inout. it's a world marvel!
really good but need scheduler. really great software been using for almost year. would of given 5 stars but as contractor i feel it's needs a scheduler connected as apart of this since your entire billing is all here. improvements very helpful and believe there heading in right directions. sooooo good to have as a mobile contractor and being able to input data at the location in real time! not wait till you get home and then enter.
fantastic software !. this has made my life a whole lot easier. invoice and estimates on the go. i really feel in control of my accounts.
very convenient. just started using it and i really like it so far. anywhere i go i can manage my business from my iphone!! very convenient
on track. keeping track of daily expenditure, and the performance of my business is so much easier with this app.
useless since update. the last update brings a gorgeous splash screen. i know this because i see it dozens of times each day since i have to log in every time i open the app! completely useless now.
i wanted to like it. but..... i didn‚Äôt appreciate the daily phone calls asking if i needed help .... i just wanted an app that would let me do my own thing and not feel harassed
qbo saved my books. this app is a great extension to the desktop, cloud based program. everything you need in the palm of you hand and more.
very nice!. i love have this power in my phone! i can email invoices or print them out, all on my phone! this app is easy to learn and soooooo fast when you get used to it. there was a lot of thinking when they designed this app, wow
superb accounting app. the only mobile app i recommend if you are into real estate. it makes my job as a small real estate owner easier and smarter. thanks quickbooks for this amazing app. great job on maintaining it. cheers! üëçü•Ç
a glaring weakness. this a pretty good mobile app. one glaring weakness is that it does not allow the manual recording of bank deposits and transfers so they can be matched later. this leaves you at the mercy of the slow banks before you can see these transactions.
doesn‚Äôt support enough features in app. can‚Äôt generate invoice with cis. not sure i will subscribe after trial.
over charge. trying to contact them for months they should stop my charge thet is never work for me can‚Äôt find the way to stop
logs out every time  please fix this!!. for the last few weeks every time i login it says there are critical updates and i need to log out and back in. every time. nothing changes or updates. very frustrating.
needs timesheet support. price went up 100 a year and still no timesheet support outside of desktop app
love this app!!. i love how easy to use this app is but my only problem is that i can't sync it with my company's ocbc account and my shopify's store's inventory.
okay. this app would be perfect if it didn‚Äôt redirects me to safari to login every single time
syncs to everything!!. awesome app. i'm using quickbooks for my personal accounting. saves a ton of time. intuit's phone and online support is terrific as well. couldn't recommend this app highly enough.
nul. logiciel bien con√ßu mais la synchronisation se fait n‚Äôimporte comment : j‚Äôai rapproch√© toutes mes factures fournisseurs pendant une journ√©e puis le soir plus rien je suis revenus au m√™me stade que le matin : tout mon travail √©tait perdu ! je contacte le support et personne ne parle fran√ßais correctement ! nul √† √©viter
app isn‚Äôt working now. please advise. it has stopped working. i click on the app and it automatically closes. new iphone today should work unless not compatible with ios13.
great app. great app quick and easy to make estimates and invoices. would like for there to be more customization such as adding business information to show on them rather than just email address however overall is a great app very happy with it.
general consensus. customer support for mobile app is horrible. the mobile app really needs some help. they should travel along with mobile users to see issues and frustrations that arise in the field. i am a professional but at times this app makes me look very unprofessional. the should work on offline features.
terrible app. keeps crashing. keeps dumping you out telling you that ‚Äúcritical updates ‚Äú and must login again. try to login and  am a very longtime customer  it tells you your company is nonexistent. ba humbug. complain to intuit and they say use a ‚Äúsupported‚Äù device. in other words: don‚Äôt use the app. time to find software other than quick books.
not support for iphone xs max. i tried to use for invoice purpose but always pop out and can‚Äôt use
quickbooks. awesome app.
new update crashes every time. new update makes me close and reopen every time for critical app updates
very useful, ios 13 login issue however. as the title says. this software, when combined with the website version, can be incredible useful. the layout is good. i use it for work and once you get to know it it‚Äôs pretty good. currently there is an issue logging in with ios 13.
great app. i've started using quick books as i switched from kashflow it's much easier and has a great user interface.
transactions incomplete. just downloaded the app. the first thing i look at is bank transactions. it doesn't show the amounts properly. first digit or two then ... and there is wasted space on the left and right of the screen. am i missing something or is that crappy design.
upload receipts feature. snap on mobile new feature saves lots of time as well the ability to drag and drop files or emailing receipts work well and helps expedite petty cash procedures. excellent addition to quickbooks online!!
recommended. fantastic app, very handy and easy to use
last update. after the last update i take a picture of my receipt, hit save and then the app closes down. then i have to login again. please fix this. my receipts are really piling up.
all gui no substance. as a business owner, i want native apps that allow me to do all major functions that are available on the desktopweb version. i want to see everything and do anything from anywhere in a simple clean interface. this app just fails to meet my expectations...i see no reason to use it.
president. i‚Äôm busy right now trying to invoice, from customer service to user friendly software qb is on point for the business man. love the service for sure.
fantastic accounting app. i love that this allows me the freedom to work and to monitor my accountant's progress on the go. it's extremely user friendly and easy to use. many features save tons of time on simple book keeping tasks. smashes traditional softwares like ubs and myob into the dust!
great app!!. no issues so far. simple to use.
life is easier. this app has made invoicing for my business easier and more mobile. i no longer have to be in the office to create estimates, invoices, receive payments, etc... perfect for my marketing business!
it works most of the time. it‚Äôs useful to have the app but more often i go to the browser site as you can do more on it. the app is good if you just want to record a quick expense and take a photo of the receipt to attach. quickbooks itself is a good accounting package, it‚Äôs just the app needs a bit more functionality.
not user friendly. quickbooks desktop has been a favorite in small business for sometime as it continues to get better in being user friendly. quickbooks online failed miserably at this. it doesn't account for businesses being different so the customization is limited to only what quickbooks allows for you to choose from.
much anticipated update. always room for improvement and each update is a step in the right direction. i've been a qbo user for 26 months now and run my whole oneman business on it. each version is a bit better than the last. i continue to be happy to see intuit continue to improve the app and the web interface.
this app makes being a business owner much more enjoyable. to be able to keep track of finances, outgoing & ongoing charges made all the difference for my small business.
it's ok not bad. it does the primary functions fine. gives you a decent insight with the new dashboard. one glitch is that it shows deleted invoices as past due.
poor. the program is slow and it is hard to find what you want. does not compare to their desktop version.
great, but can learn from others. just my observations: mobile app should be mostly used to record expenses. it lacks ocr tracing. moreover scanning a receipt is a multistep process. should add forcetouch to add receipt (open in camera). invoices: been searching how to add my banking information. cannot believe quickbooks does not allow for adding banking information to invoices. did i miss something? or is it a hidden feature? not very intuitive (pun intended). otherwise good. like the integration with bank account.
fantastic for on the go.. customers pay me and i put it right in the app. no waiting until i get home to forget. love this app.
"confusing and cluttered app. i love that nearly all of the features in the desktop app are here in the mobile app. however the interface, especially the home page, is confusing and cluttered. ""company activity"" is a bit useless as the default page. show me the charts of paidunpaid invoices. i think the developers are tasked with including every single feature and that clouds their design judgement. it's not an easy ask but let's make this app more mobile friendly."
just need it to be reliable, that‚Äôs it. simply just opening the app and signing in is more trouble than needed in some days. qb has everything i need already. i‚Äôd rather have bank connections, signing in, viewing basic info, and all the basics work flawlessly than anything else.
be careful. i loved this app for 10 months. then an error occurred and i lost access to my business. only cost me $200 for one time fix. for $600 i could have purchased a 3 month fix. the risk exceeds the benefit.
tons of bugs and glitches. there are lots of glitches and lack of features in this app. the vendor transaction history is spotty, many vendors and missing history all together. profit and loss report doesn‚Äôt scroll. can‚Äôt see the true checkbook register of checks that are written out but haven‚Äôt yet cleared. it‚Äôs really not very good.
update is buggy. the latest update won't save invoices correctly and doesn't pull up all my clients names. i hope it's fixed soon i use it daily.
need better multicurrency functionality. ... an ok app to review transactions and do some basic entries.
needs work. i want to be mobile but this app won't let me select different dates for items on invoices or employee hours. please make it more functional.
stopping subscription. originally a useful app, but keeps crashing following the most recent update on 27.09. will have to stop subscription and find something that works, so whats the point in updating the app if you lose customers?
i love quickbooks online. i love quickbooks online & my accountant does also. this app is really good for doing your expenses on but as far as invoicing i still do it on the computer. it's very handy for a small business. the fact you can enter an expense, take a picture of the receipt & go on your merry way. i'm sold.
love it for our small businesses. love using quickbooks for both our small businesses! makes collecting our invoices and communicating with our customers super easy!
couldn't be more useful. i should have been using this a long time ago. now i can keep up on the go. replaced my word search game when it comes to killing time, and the best part is i'm productive.
just barely ok.. app has multiple issues . with page format. browser must use google chrome to get all options . called 3 times , on phone over hour each time . weeks later still nothing fixed . app is very limited .. customer service is a joke . here i thought i was upgrading to a better software . lol i was so wrong ..
best way to keep track of your expenses. i love this it works very well a little hard to learn but very simple to use what you learn how to do it i use it to track all my business expenses and it works perfectly i love the touch id lot it keeps everything very secure you cannot go wrong with this i absolutely recommend it for small business owners and businesses in general
clumsy, slow, crashes often. not a great app, times out saving transactions, sometimes saves them, sometimes not. not worth the money
accept button doesn‚Äôt work.. love the app however this latest update the accept button doesn‚Äôt seem to work so you can‚Äôt accept the new line items from your bank feed.
one word. awesome. i love this cause i can store all the receipt online.
"new ""update"" = no more watch app, instability. why did you take away the watch app?"
great. this app helps my small business tremendously. very easy to navigate, enter and retrieve data. very affordable.
dubai. i tried to register dubai address but looks like only us address possible.
mileage tracker, not working. i have emailed for help, chatted with online help and nothing is solved. the last response i got from the chat support was ‚Äúoh.‚Äù there is something wrong with the app not my phone. i can‚Äôt even save mileage manually, i get an error that says ‚Äútry back later‚Äù i am paying $40month, this needs to work.
does not work. app does not work. wish it did, but it does not. none of my vendor activity shows up, profit and loss does not scroll past first page. better no app at all than one that does not work.
"bad idea. i downloaded to approve parole only to find i need a second app for that. two out of three ""recognized"" transactions are inaccurate. back to my mac for qb. ugly app guys. sorry..."
great cloud based platform with all the features i need.. qb online is a phenomenal cloud based accounting platform (when using apple products). quick easy invoicing, banking, payroll, and report generation for the business owner on the go. seamless integration from mobile device to desktop with realtime updates and editing across all users. this platform slow me to run my $1.5 mil small business from my bed, boat, camper...virtually anywhere i have cellular signal. it allows me to be as mobile as i wish.
mr. doesn't work on ipad pro or iphone. it says my subscription has expired. i have had it for several years and it still works on macbook but on ios it thinks i am on a free trial until 13th april but still locks me out saying i need to update my subscription. it is useless to me if it won,t work on ipad because i photograph all my receipts into the app. will cancel subscription if it doesn't work soon.
doesn't work for ipad. this app doesn't even load my company info. it keeps returning error trying to load company info. i have contacted quickbooks a number of times and all they say is they are working on the issue and to use a web browser version in the mean time. i have seen about 4 updates released and not one of them has fixed this issue. when will this be fixed?
qbooks is a entrepreneur's dream. i've been doing bussines as general contractor the last 20 yrs, always i tried to find a software where i can handle all my administrative information at all (invoicing, payroll, expenses) with this apps you can get everything at your fingers reach, so you can control all money inout. it's a world marvel!
quickly. quickbooks online is ready to use. i write invoices and email the customer a copy immediately. thanks quickbooks for being so easy to use.
great app. great app that does all it promises to do. so handy for getting out quotes when away from the office.
landscape company. i like this app as it helps me stay on top of the billing before i leave the site. but the client care and billing is horrible customer care is the worst in north america. stay far away from this company. they bill you when they are not suppose to.
daily user of this app. getting better and better keep up the development i appreciate it.
how did i run my business without it?. i do half my estimates and invoices on the go with this app. saves me so much time!
crashing and signing out. hi there this app continuously crashes saying it needs crucial updates. there are no updates and continues to do the same over and over again. i cannot use it at all now. help.
online version need improvement. the online version specially on ipad is very difficult to use. if the could make the ipad version like the desktop version gui it would help. the app is a little unstable because of the cookies and the background history that does≈Ñt refresh the actual data timely. overall, it is a decent product they just need to make some tweaks.
great app. very good app to manage quickbooks when you are away from your desk.
functions missing. works well enough but when receiving payments it doesn't allow you to pick the bank account. frequent problems with it locking up as well
convenient. i upgraded to quickbooks online after some computer problems. it is so comforting to know i can access my information from several devices and the transition went smoothly.
great package. i'm on the road and this accounting package works great. also nice that my accountant has direct access.
app is almost useless for me.. the only reason i upgraded to quickbooks on line was so that i could do estimates and invoicing on site. this app will allow me to do an estimate but will not let me do a partial invoice. if i can‚Äôt do a partial invoice on the app it‚Äôs simply a waste of time for my small fencing business.
another weak quickbooks mobile app. once again, with excitement i upgrade only to be letdown. when will intuit make a full function app? i love the message that tells me the function isn't't available for my device but i can access it from my pc...great, i'm still tied to my desk! why bother with the mobile app then??
quickbooks. quickbooks has been absolutely amazing overall. main issue is customer service and their ability to provide customer support for the app. i was required to ph 3 different numbers, one being out of service. once i finally spoke to csr he was extremely friendly but did state they haven‚Äôt been provided proper training to assist with app related issues but would do his best to help. i would upgrade to 4 or 5 stars if they provide a user friendly option for support.
excellent customer support.. features wise need lot of improvement. still giving four stars because of excellent customer support.
needs payroll and transfer capability. would be nice if you could do payroll and be able to do transfers for paying your visa
address. please allow me to copy and paste full address inside customer section. currently i can only copy street, city, postal code separately. customer wants me to add address of site worked.
still needs some changes. multiple addresses for a company is still a drama as it changes all pervious invoices and quotes. plus now on the ipad version it says i can't access until subscription is paid but it is.. works on computer but can't use my ipad. annoying!!!
way to much money for the service don't buy into claims. never is up to date loads so slow a total waist of money.
shiny, pretty and useless. the shinier they make it, the more confusing and unfriendly it gets. no reminders, no scheduled transactions and no searchable help. i have the ipad app to make accounting quick and easy when i travel not to have something new to learn.
can't save invoices. invoices can't be saved on iphone.
very nice!. i love have this power in my phone! i can email invoices or print them out, all on my phone! this app is easy to learn and soooooo fast when you get used to it. there was a lot of thinking when they designed this app, wow
great applimited function. it is a great app. wish it had full functionality. payroll within the app. not a extra app. that only works. if you want ituit to handle everything. need to work like accessing from desktop. writing checks should also be there. plus running reports. but it is a great app. with limited function. has gotten better. just wish it was getting there faster.
fantastic. fantastic. i'm am obsessed with this app. a must for everyone!
cant update billing info in app. slow, awkward layout, intelligent prefill of categories usually incorrect slowing down workflow. will be using moyob to set up accounts for my next fy.
excellent interface and convenient app. this app is a life saver and helps me run my small business affairs smoothly. i can submit my invoices and estimates on the go with ease. definitely a must app to have.
works great. really like the functionality of the app. having it available no matter what device i want to use is a real time saver.
great app!. awesome tool for your business. if you don‚Äôt have a background in basic accounting principals, get a bookkeeper to help you set it up. a great chart of accounts will make the reports super useful.
"fees on fees. while the app itself works and is fairly handy, i strongly advise against quickbooks as a company. i signed on as a business owner for $6.95 a month and was immediately slapped with over $100 in fees hidden in ""fine print"". worse is the utter inability to get any customer support from intuit. i canceled my subscription and despite already paying for the month, lost access immediately and lost all of my records. then i got billed again. stay away."
small business accounting. very helpful software for my business. has everything from accounting software to expenses, to employee payroll and deductions. has helped me become more efficient with my time. makes estimating and invoicing more streamline.
great when it works.... this was a great boon for our mobile business. gives us versatility and makes us streamline our accounting. beware of app upgrades. all our iphone 5s phones suddenly stopped creating invoice items which rendered us unable to charge customers. for two week we attempted to remedy the problem with intuit to no avail. they finally told us to contact apple about their (intuit) app. made no sense. they get you to depend on their app then don't support it.
worse than useless. i downloaded this app as use quickbooks daily, the pc software is great! the apple app is such a waste of time, i can‚Äôt access any reports and the info it does show me is a waste of my time just a load of numbers that don‚Äôt mean anything. no thought has gone into this app i suspect it‚Äôs just a tick box exercise creating an app...
limited. desktop app for mac is brutal slow. mobile apps ok but limited graphic reports
extremely limited, useless. inability to enter time activity which is basic functionality that‚Äôs extremely useful on mobile.
can't imagine not using quickbooks!. so much easier that our previous accounts package. so many apps and addons you can build a complete solution what ever business your in.
absolutely terrible!!!!!. this app is garbage. funny that intuit is in their name because there is nothing intuitive about anything in this app at all. complete waste of time!!! complete garbage. just trying to set up the basic information about accounts that i use and tailor the app to my needs was excruciating. i can‚Äôt say enough about how bad this is!!!!!!
works when you're on the go!. easy app navigation. easy to create, send,invoices.
good app and great support. easy to use although experienced problem with vat rate not being editable in online desktop version. intuit' response was really quick and efficient and friendly. highly recommend.
useless. why even bother with this app? i can enter a bill from a sub or supplier on the website or the mac app but can only enter paid expenses here? i can do everything i need to do with my business on my iphone without carrying an ipad or macbook air except use the quickbooks app to enter or actually pay bills (only able to record bills already entered as paid). please fix this (or just tell us you‚Äôre not fixing it) !!!
ios 13; don‚Äôt do it!. if you need this app to work correctly do not upgrade to ios 13 yet! many bugs... my worst bug: can‚Äôt look at any customer info anymore, does not work. yes i uninstalled and reinstalled...
over promised, under delivered. the desktop app is slow and the mobile app is lacking pretty important features. their tech support is horrible and can take days to resolve an issue....if they even admit that there is an issue.
crashed when entered a sales transaction. downloaded this app to see if i could use it instead of at a computer and the app crashed as soon as i tried to enter a sales transaction. i tried to enter in the receipt type and it crashed
mr. recent updates have slowed both the phone and computer app to a crawl. very frustrating. otherwise a very good app on my phone.
not accurate. even after the most recent update the app still dose not accurately reflect my qbo account. all information on vended and clients are not up to date. this had been an ongoing issue for more than a year now. i keep hoping with every update this will be correct, but nothing yet.
horrible. worst company and app to deal with. had to click 1 star they are negative 5 stars
excellent. quickbooks online has created a whole new dimension to bookkeeping and accounting for small business. the ipad app is very useful for an overview of transactions
construction company. new updated camera function is awful! i used to be able just to take a picture of my receipts with no problem, now it takes me forever. some of my receipts or as long as my arm and trying to fit them into a preformatted box, waiting for the camera figure it out, horrible horrible! please go back to a more manual camera! owner converse construction
great job. great app. very well designed and very user friendly
crashes a ton. this is a great app for bookkeeping for my business, but it crashes almost daily on my iphone. please get better engineers for the functionality of this app!! so frustrating when i‚Äôm in the middle of printing invoices and the app crashes! how am i supposed to conduct business that way!?!
ceo. this is a really good app it has help our business in so many ways. it help boost our profit margin we have been able to close deals, and make invoices right on the spot. i recommend this for a lot of different business with quickbooks online.
missing features. missing bills (that you print cheques and pay later). missing payroll. this would be fine except they're raising the price on everyone in a few months.
ios 10.01 update...... awful! not user friendly. keeps telling me to update safari to use program. still can't run checks!
getting better with every upgrade.. great app. they do lure you with the free use then hit ya with the charges later. i think it's a useful tool in the toolbox.
great app. this is a great app for small businesses.
app for small busines. fact, this app save me 11 hours a week in paper work period. great for small start up business
needs some work. this app is good but needs more work. error message kept popping up while working in it. some tasks are missing like entering bills. can't find sign out button or switch to a different company.
changed the way we do business. i love this app. we needed something that we could easily use in the field. we can create estimates, invoices, receive payments and even attach check images to those payments. our productivity has skyrocketed. quickbooks has figured out the mobile accounting software. customers for life.
qbo and this app two thumbs down.. how does such a large company make such a crappy product. basic logical steps can‚Äôt be completed. you go to summit a improvement and tons of people have listed the same things and nothing ever gets fixed. the app jumps back and forth between web view and app view. support is horrible. you can‚Äôt even move different parts of the invoice or estimate around in the app. switching to zoho
down fall in quality. not a quality app. the screen is difficult to maneuver around in. there's no back or close.
not great. there are multiple problems wrong with this program. you can't bill a customer when you attach a receipt which means i constantly have to switch between devices. my expenses according to the customer are incorrect. i'd like to see my estimateinvoice minus my expenses per job. the only reason i switched to this program from freshbooks, which is way less expensive and more user friendly is because quickbooks has a balance sheet, which our accountant required.
pretty good. nice to have my business account online so i can check and send invoices when needed. only annoyance is it keeps fully logging me out.
please add more search options. this is a great app to accompany a great service. my only request is that i be able to search for content within invoices themselves. for faster lookup!
only a trial. would have been nice to know it was a trial only, i saw the in app purchase option but no where did it say trial.
you need to purchase one per company. if you own multiple companies this software may not work for you. unless you rather pay double and in my case triple for each software per company. highly disappointed and no one that would solve it. regretfully invested.
nothing adds up. when you run a business you want your numbers correct. i don't have time to troubleshoot why your software can't add a simple paypal balance and leaves transactions out. your fired!
the app is limited. i like that the app gives me the ability to create invoices and receive payments. however, i cannot create bills in the app which is very frustrating.
"don't download latest version!!. software was great before the latest update. now, no more touchid support, no ability to email invoices. we all remember what apple did with the maps mess, i wonder if intuit will have the testicular fortitude to ""can"" the person who attempted to update the already good software?"
no employee section. this app contains nothing to help your employees, only the business manager. quick books could‚Äôve at least added support for timesheets and such since they no longer allow you to save your timesheet in mobile browsers.
great software & online support. quickbooks support is great
why the love. app just doenst work well  slow and just not a great experience.
bug fixed. your problem with app
bugs. i had quickbooks for two years but had to switch because of prevalent bug issues. eventually i had to reinstall the app every time i wanted to use it.
app ruined. come on!!!!! the app is totally unusable now. can't save invoices, can't email them to the right person and can't create them with the correct info. this is the type of screw up that someone should be fired over.
what, no zero star option?. great job with touch id and your lousy payroll app. everything this company does is garbage. tells you about the sad state of affairs in financial software if quickbooks is even an option to have to use.
quickbooks. great accounting app, been using quickbooks for years now and it keeps getting better. i would be lost without it. so easy to use with great tutorials. i'd highly recommend.
great. it is a great way of keeping on top of my finances, invoicing and money owed. allows invoices to be raised on the go when small jobs are completed. can see how it will adapt as my business grows as well
"new to qb app. love it, but needs a ""statement"" tab"
avoid like the plague!. app doesn't work, says trial expired. customer support are unhelpful and have no idea when it will be fixed. we have a years worth of books on this and now we need to find new software  we've been in business for more than 26 years and have never known service like this. seriously, find another solution. this is not the software you are looking for.
crashing at start up with ios 13. love this app but it crashes with ios 13 :( please fix
demoted from 5 stars to 4. using the app on ipad and iphone for more than 5 years. dashboard has been unable to properly show invoice status for at least 3 months now. version 17.9, at least 3 updates ago? no fix yet nor response from intuit after feedback. while i‚Äôm not fond of frequent updates, one expects to have these kinds of obvious bugs fixed in the next update.
great for my business. ‚ù§Ô∏è this program
bad customer service. worked for a month then disconnected from my bank, so email sent, didn‚Äôt get a reply for 2 days!!!! emailed again another 3 days later i get a reply, problem with bank couldn‚Äôt be sorted so i downloaded xero, absolute pleasure to use.dont use quickbooks!!!!!!!!
it's happening. the quickbook people are really developing this app and there complete system, from a very poor beginning the app is is really strong now and very functional, please keep up the good work quickbooks people. highly recommended book keeping system.
quickbooks is quirky. i am not a fan because they just don't embrace mac users. the app is not reliably working.
very nice app. very easy to use and make my all estimates and invoices very smooth and keep the updates very soon
really convenient to use. you can use any mobile device to create invoice and doing expense! really use to use and user friendly!
touch id rules. much easier to login now.
latest update is disappointing. i am on qb on my iphone off and on all day. the new update has me logging in nearly every time. very frustrating. the release notes indicate that its purpose is to fix bugs with the pin and fingerprint logins. it has become much worse. when i add a customer, i am unable to find that customer in my list.
horrible. please update this app so it stops crashing during every use!!! also, critical updates every time you try and do anything???? getting old and frustrating. fix it!!!!! also, why when you update a transaction, it saves it from before the update, so you are doing the work twice???
great software. i worked with quickbooks over 5 year and i say 90% of the time works great thats. good for accounting software
quickbooks online app. very simple use, efficient and stable. i have no complaints!
great app. great app. can grab my ipad anywhere and do what i need to do.
office assistant. i am still a huge fan of the desktop version! the one great thing about the qbo is the online feature! it still needs improvements. if you have multi companies you have to pay individual packages for each company and log out to be able to log on the other. there is no switch between companies feature on the phone app like on the desktop and the full qbo site.
quick, easy & powerful. qbo is an excellent product. the functionality and the strength of the product lends itself to a very useful accounting tool. we are pleased with the product. thank you!
garbage. signed up to their free trial, spent hours putting up my receipts only to be told i have to start again because of an error at their end. now locked out of my account and all my original receipts have faded taking even more hours trying to communicate with them to gain access to my account
fantastic. we are a small chauffer business, since using quickbooks online we gave cut the acoustic administration down by 60%. and it can be used in the vehicle via the app. and best of all, it works.
can't offline book keeping.. it's terrible that you can't add expenses when offline. the app needs internet constantly and that's very frustrating as lots of my business is outside of network. basically the app is useless if you don't have internet!
great improvement over previous versions. previous versions were useless. this finally is an app that is not only useful, but a great productivity tool. had to use the ipad version when splits suddenly stopped working in quickbooks online. discovered the ipad app to now be fully functional.
works well and good value. we migrated from the desktop version and that was relatively easy to do and the online version is cost effective and does what it says on the tin! it's great that it's on my phone and ipad as well as desktop gives me access when i need it. no issues so far and the support is good.
nightmare update. it was bad before the update. how could it be even worse now? unending refreshing bank data (constant spinning wheel) makes it virtually useless and beyond frustrating for reviewing and matching transactions on the iphone.
new update 115. the new update is horrible!! i used to be able to search customers by address and the search bar is gone. also, whatever screen i choose to be in, i have to fully close the app out to go back! what happened?!?!
qb online. just upgraded from wui quickbooks pro 2011 to quickbooks online. this program is absolutely fantastic. i love the ease of receiving payments. love that i can take photos of my receipts paid to vendors. simply a great product. customer support was also wonderful in helping me get transferred from 2011
poor service. difficult to set up invoice template and negotiate site, customer service poor, and when you try to write a review and send it off if the nickname is taken you have to write it all out again. as usual well advertised on tv but fails to deliver.
quickbooks makes it easy. quickbooks is one of the biggest reasons my company has hit tremendous growth. online invoices and payments makes my job literally a thousand times easier.
"not ready for prime time.  can't add numbers in ""amount"" fields like you can in client version (ipad and desktop)  can't edit customer when logged in as salesperson (ipad)  auto populate doesn't work when sending invoice when logged in salesperson (ipad)  can't manage users (ipad)  does not display user name anywhere on screen when logged in (ipad and desktop)"
the best. this app is the best for my businnes, when i use him as a contractor is the best, because i never lost money or forget charge any work. i love it.
callous. no one ever reviews or responds to help tickets raised for quickbooks india edition. better to close down attempts to sell in india rather than bringing bad name to such a great software originally!! not suitable for india unless they make attempts to improve and shun away their callousness!!!!!!
poor. need to put password in every time i start can't write a service invoice and an amount
jan 2019 update is a fail. i‚Äôm a daily  hourly user. the january 2019 update won‚Äôt keep me logged in. after about 90 seconds i get an error message and get logged out.
makes it easy. so glad i decided to go with quickbooks, update daily to keep track of expenses and sales. fantastic for my business.
¬°awesome!. just awesome & super user friendly & modern! good job üî•üî•üî•
not great, but no other options on phoneipad. this is terribly buggy software. intuit is not on the ball with development. enter a transaction or invoice on this app, then find it not entered on quickbooks online. won't sync. menus don't work or show on the ipad or iphone. called intuit and they said it's still a young app and they're working on it. i have little faith. hope this all gets fixed.
how do i remove this app from my iphone?. i do not want to use thus app and now i cannot uninstall it from my iphone. l try by holding the icon and get a message asking if i want to share it. does not show in my settings so i cannot delete it there either. can't find online help.
questionable developers and qa. don‚Äôt bother with this app. more time updating this weekly with version changes and bug fixes... jokers edit; 29th nov 2019  this continues  just look at the version history log on the app...
major flaw. the app ui is pretty good and i really like the interface. the problem is that a lot of my invoices are not even viewable on the app. basically anything that has a delayed charge on it won't show up so there is a major glitch there or something.
create a project under a customer for ios. this needs to be added asap. we are a mobile company and would very much utilize creating a project on the go in ios. both for ipad and iphone. thanks.
helpful. while not a fully functioning mobile version of qbo, this app is great for checking up on things.
review. i am self employed, i find quickbooks is easy to use as my business is extremely simple. i do have an issue with the annual cost. i think that you should have different rates for individuals like myself who only use it a few times a week.
great!. i've used quickbooks for years. very happy with the online. version, it allows me to take care of my invoicing anytime anywhere. my business is more profitable now because i can send an invoice when the job is complete and there's no forgetting to do it at the end of the day. if your business is mobile shouldn't your accounting be also?
rubbish. absolutely rubbish since the last update . keeps crashing on iphone xr. screen message = app needs to close due to critical updates. happens 2030 x times a day when trying to set up an invoice estimate etc. test your updates before release you them, you idiots!
awesome app. great app to compliment the web based quickbooks program, made my accounting tracking and hassles a thing of the past.
great app!. help you keep track of your business records.
quickbooks a real sage beater!. having been a sage customer for over 15 years i wish i had discovered quick books sooner, why did i spend all that money on yearly updates when i didn‚Äôt need too. i absolutely would recommend quickbooks to everyone and i do! thanks for a great product guys üëçüèª
fab. brilliant app that updates instantly, giving a visual handle on your business at any time. thank you
best app for any business. i'm a musician and this app helps keep track of all my gigs and insures proper payment!
seabreeze sealants. awesome app, makes running our business quick & easy in all aspects, we are able to stay in control of cash flow and invoices. highly recommend üëåü§ô
what's happened?!. usually excellent for uploading expenses it's now decided not to communicate with my online account. i can see all my expenses in the app but not online. so now, do i do it all again online? scan every receipt individually? or do i wait until it perhaps decides to work? i really don't want to then have to remove everything if it doubles up! pls fix :(
great app. easy to setup and use.
qb online. quickbooks online is awesome and easy to use, having customer information on your mobile phone help save time money and keeps you aware of who has paid and who hasn‚Äôt paid anywhere you go, it‚Äôs very easy to print invoices to a wifi printer.
updates have made it horrible. i love using the online version. the august updates however have tanked the app. it is no longer sharing information between my iphone, ipad, and mac. the sorting feature of estimates is now gone ( pending, accepted, closed) it only shows in last changed order, not good when working with 3 month or longer history. on a positive note, i do like the photo modification for the iphone. it no longer adds to my photo album, just imports to quickbooks.
topbooks. superb software, tried the rest and settled for the best. highly recommended.
awesome. one of the best apps i have used for tracking and creating invoices, keeps me on track and easy to use.
great program. i find myself keeping better records. very user friendly. great program
awful. iphone app pretty much unusable in the real world. always wants to be signed in each time you open it, touch id feature doesn't work. today it's complaining the app needs to be updated before i use it, it then directs me to the app store where it shows i already have the latest version!
great app. great app for tracking all my company transactions. love that i can get a tax report for quarterly reporting.
new update issues. the previous update solved these issues, but this current update causes error messages with sales rep login whenever creating invoices, and also causes printing communication errors constantly.
app as of lately. every time  every single time  i open app, it tells me it must log out because it‚Äôs running critical updates. it worked fine until a week ago. not sure if it‚Äôs related to apple software but it‚Äôs getting old.
new update changed invoices. the app shuts down every time i get a signature!!
hate the app. limited functionality of the app makes it virtually useless... unless i have access to a pic or laptop, i can't do all the things i need to do. the program itself is good, just not sure why the app hasn't caught up yet.
useless. the app keeps crashing, if you‚Äôre in the middle of typing a long estimate or creating an invoice, it crashes and your file is gone, you have to keep saving your project, otherwise when it crashes, your project is gone. very disappointed, going to a different app or software at the beginning of the year, three years with this crap, paying high monthly rates, and for nothing.
good start. qbo app is a good start, great for on the go invoicing, estimates and receipts. paperless ... i use to have customers sign a paper copy invoice on delivery of products, now i can have them sign on my ipad or phone. negative reviews saying it is too basic and simple. i don't believe any app is made to be full functioning of its base online application.
