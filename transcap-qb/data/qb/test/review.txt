very beneficial app. this is a very beneficial app. it does not replace the pc version but is an excellent aid. it's helpful to send invoices on the go or at the end of a service call. the sooner the customer gets invoice the more chance i have of getting paid. it is a very good aid!
don’t you qa this stuff?. the expenses screen is still full of bugs. the whole thing goes wrong after adding a photo (which, incidentally, are now auto cropped even worse than before) and returning to the expenses screen. don’t you test this stuff before releasing it?? (i’m on iphone x).
great app. the only thing this app is missing is being able to generate reports. give me that and i'd gladly pay a few bucks for this wonderful tool. saves me a lot of time
super app for accounting. super
great app. good for a non accounting person like me. i can keep track and give it all to my accountant and it gets done. i love that i can send invoices from my ipad and enter info etc. two thumbs up!
waste of time. i paid for the app to get the discount, spent an afternoon inputting information and suddenly it wouldn’t save anything. logged out, rebooted, problem still existed. uninstalled app. on reinstall, the system didn’t recognize my login and i couldn’t access any of the work i input. apple has my $$$ though!
best financial app for non-finance people. the most user friendly, cutting edge, accessible and collaborative financial app you can find which is affordable and does the job with least amount of financial knowledge.
"would like to like it better, but it gets worse!. i personally like the ipad app better than the online version for interface, but it has so many bugs! constantly gives me error message that i'm not authorized to do something (add/edit a customer, etc.), but then it lets me do it. but i keep having to close out all the error messages that pop up. often won't let me email an invoice. won't let me add customer off of creating a new estimate (have to add customer, close, then do estimate and choose customer again). the list of basic things that should not be an issue goes on and on. on the iphone app, there is no place for my reps to view the contact person's name at the company! i'm sure there are other things i could think of, but i've just learned to compensate and work around things. however an app with this many bugs should not be out there - it's pretty pathetic! update 11/18/15 - after update, all the previous bugs are still there. pathetic to issue an update and not fix what was wrong! update 1/14/16 - even worse! now i can no longer add an item to an estimate or see the customer name on estimates or invoices under ""activity"". what is wrong with you people? if you can't make it better, leave it alone! now it is completely useless!"
excelente app. intuit ha hecho un excelente trabajo de poner a la mano literalmente los libros de contabilidad de la práctica y de los clientes. totalmente funcional y fácil de usar.
waste of time!. total waste of time. i like the cd version than the online version. i hope intuit will try to combine the app to include all the features that are on the software version. i am a landscaper and my office needs to be with me outside, not stuck in an office. i need a program where i can take my work with me to my job site. so, when i meet my customers i can give them an an estimate right away on the spot and be able to email to them write away or be able have my customers sign the estimate right away. i would also like do the same with my invoices. it would make it so much easier to count all the footage and labour at the work site - that i don't forget anything and the homeowners can count with me too. on top, i can complete my invoice on the job site and be able to send it to my customers right away. the ipad is much lighter to carry then carrying a laptop. more people are choosing the laptop over the desktop for convenience, in the same way, one day people are going to choose the ipad over the laptop. i hope quickbooks can bring that future now. i just would like to be able to make my invoices and estimates at a job site, where ever that is, and basically be able to edit it and send it to my customers and have my customers sign my estimates on the job site and fix the deal. also i would like to be able to enter in my customers payment right away so i don't have to wait tell i get into the office and then enter that in. as well as, have that information on my app be able to easily transfer to my computer when i am able to get into the office. thanks, but quickbooks should be thanking me because i just showed your companies future -should be headed this way if it is not already thinking of this idea!
"quickbooks customer service is atrocious. i run a small business. i did all my invoicing and accounting through quickbooks. i paid for 14 months for this service. now i have to find a new service, reload all my client data for over a couple years, all the items that were saved as line items for invoicing and other things as well. here's the story: customer for over a year. my credit card gets stolen. no big deal. there is a 6 day lapse in payment while my new card is in the mail. i update my itunes account and make sure all of my subscriptions are paid and current. the app proceeds for 2 weeks to tell me that i don't have a subscription anymore and eventually locks me out. the app will not sync with itunes to see my paid subscription. i spent an hour on the phone with apple, they can't do anything. i spent 2 hours on the phone with quickbooks for them almost verbatim to tell me that if i don't cancel my subscription on itunes and pay directly to them (it's $3 more a month) that it'll never work again and that ""while we want your business you don't have enough of a history for us to do anything"". i call apple back and after an hour on the phone they refund me two months, tell me to file a dispute for the last year with my credit card company, report the app and write my experience in the apps review section. stay far, far, far away from this company. they are awful and i will make sure that i tell everyone i can to stay far away from them as well."
paid app. app costs 8.99 a month
discontinued...... of course vie been using this app for over a year now and has been super handy. lately been having issues so i called qb only to be told it's discontinued now. wonderful.
worst service. changed a template i have used for invoices and estimates for 5 years without warning or reason i cannot access the ones i sent even one week ago customer service said i was using a classic template and it's gone and not coming back . makes zero sense it's 2017 get a clue . don't buy don't join charge back!
awesome app. it's very user friendly and informative. i really like how easy it is to assign an expense category and the convenient display of the profit / loss feature.
greatest app ever. i love the “capture receipt” feature. makes life a whole lot easier.
absolutely fantastic!. this app is incredible. having been using for 6 months, and it has revolutionised the way we are able to do business. so easy to setup, use and understand. i highly recommend to anyone that needs an easy order/invoice/sales system for their business.
tonya pitchford. app and product are useless for my particular business. very hard to deal with, fees are high
getting too flaky. i’ve been a subscriber for about 2 years now but am now randomly getting locked out of the app where it thinks i don’t have a subscription! i’ve reported the issue , it always gets resolved but then returns ! went to do my accounts and quotes this weekend and guess what .... i’m locked out ... again! is that acceptable for a business app ! definitely not.
quick books on my phone!. i just found the iphone app and so far, i'm loving it. no longer tied to my laptop and spotty internet on the road.
not pleased. for one i still can't re-download the app after i accidentally deleted it. it's been months. i hit the cloud button and it does nothing. i also put an estimate in and the phone didn't save it. when i checked desktop it was saved 6x because i kept trying to do it on the phone. the app has many glitches but it is helpful when i'm not by a computer but u cannot rely solely on the app.
quickbooks online. i wish the app was easier and more full functional but then the whole online product is sorely lacking relative to the old offline product. saas makes such a difference for smbs but intuit has missed the boat on the cloud-based solution. ugh!!
excellent. does what it says on the tin.. excellent app. works brilliantly on the ipad, sometimes find it a little sluggish on the iphone but i put that down to the poor wifi we sometimes have and bad signal from phone operator. anyways it's so easy to use and i can produce an invoice there and then and email to the client instantly. don't know why i took so long to move from desktop to quickbooks online.
terrible experience. downloaded quickbooks to try it out. two days into the free trial i tried to get the discount through uber and was over charged for 6 months of service after the payment “ failed to process” then checked my bank statement to see it charged my account 6 times(each for 1 month of service) i called and waited on hold for an hour. finally talked with someone who could not help me and recommend i call uber to see if they charged me. the whole experience has been terrible. waste of time and money, would not recommend to anyone. find a cheap/free app that works and doesn’t steal money from your account.
great app. convenient. quickbooks app is very easy to use and makes tracking expenses quick and easy.
awesome app. awesome app and online as well. runs rings around xero. app is 100x better
owner small massage therapy business. for the small amount of paperwork my business requires, this app is perfect. i can input info before leaving the office and it prompts me with appropriate questions to categorize items properly. very user friendly and convenient.
drat! not even close. this has no more functionality than the mobile ap, very disappointing! access to the banking tab & registers to make and receive payments, along with access to the entire vendor tab & reporting would be helpful. i am not sure why intuit focused its efforts on creating an app that imports images & info from social networking sites intead of focusing on making better functionality of what it actually takes to run a business.
high hopes cause big fails. the app crashes all of the time. no integration with desktop versions but ok. i though i would have something on the go for small invoices. i can't get through the first invoice. all progress gets lost with the crashes. i love how much time i save with the desktop version. there customer service has always been terrible. they can't even have a fully working version for the trial period. fail!
"frustrating. the number one use for this app should be to keep track of activity on the go so you don't play catch up at the office. for me, not being able to bill my clients for expenses through the mobile platform renders this app basically useless. i still have to remember to log in and find the expenses of the day and mark them as ""billable expenses"" when i return to my computer?!?"
awesome i just need to learn to use it. its awesome i love it but im new to it so i have a little bit of trouble using some of the features but im sure i will get the hang of it with time n experience
modern and simple. i am happy i made my final choice on accounting software to be quickbooks online and then having this app to accompany it. as others have already said, it needs to have more access to the other accounting features that come with the full online package but i'm hoping for more updates.
helpful app 😊. so far very satisfied with this app. able to record expenses and deposits on the go and quickly. less time spent doing tedious book work. two thumbs up! 👍🏻👍🏻
many tech issues - poor customer support. after weeks of connecting to my bank account and importing my transactions automatically, the app decided to stop doing that. customer service was not helpful. also the reporting capabilities and graphics are very limited.
best app for small business. excellent
deposits take too long. overall the app is convenient for clients to pay me, but it takes entirely too long for deposits to be posted to my account.
great app. works well
great tool. a great app for invoicing on the fly and emailing customers invoices when they forget them or you need to look up how much they owe. no this isn't the full blown desktop/online version and i don't think that was the intent. it does what i need it to while i'm not at a computer.
"dissapointing. used to love this ap. but it has been garbage for some time now. takes forever to login and load on my iphone (even slower on my ipad). once you are finally in adding new customers or saving estimates is just as bad. have called customer support to find out what is going on and received the response ""we know about the issue and we are working on it"". this was over two months ago. i was added to their escalation list and have yet to receive an update. horrible customer service. actively looking for a different direction for our business."
"barely acceptable. tldr; tracking work and getting paid are either impossible or broken via the app, but are functional in the online app, mostly. there are major features lacking in the app: you cannot add delayed charges from the app, invoices generated on the web are present but not *visible* in the app! your customer asks you ""what do i owe you"" and you pull up your fancy app to show him only to get an error that the invoice was created on the web so you then waste time to dig it out of your email, all the while feeling like a fool for agreeing to a perpetual subscription for incomplete functionality. this is your life with quickbooks online. accepting payments via app is a chore: to simply select your customer (which you must do for each payment) entails several annoying steps: 1. load payment screen (two taps) 2. tap ""select customer"" (no in-line search!) 3. tap search *button* to reveal search bar 4. tap search *bar* to bring up keyboard 5. tap the customer how could this critical workflow be so poorly executed? receiving payment is the actual purpose of qb right? since most businesses have more than a screen-full of customers it might be a sane default to just start a customer search as soon as a payment is selected, saving 5 taps. at least focus the keyboard to start searching when you tap the search icon, saving 3 taps. speaking of getting paid, though not directly related to the app: quickbooks payments is a broken product, you send an invoice with a balance forward and your customer has no option to pay balance forward, so you're stuck explaining to customers that the bill they just paid is not the *entire* bill, awesome."
might be better. purchases within the app are very expensive! and, by the way, the app cannot be considered as stable
statement from app ?. works great for me but i wish you were able to print off a statement from the app.
too much it won’t do. for me, this app is long on promise and short on delivery. if they called it qbo transactions, it would be much closer to right. unfortunately, they sell it as an app version of the real thing and that’s just wrong. among the can’ts: - can’t click click into report elements - can’t change reporting basis (cash/accrual) - can’t run reports on most of the chart of accounts - can’t get vendor details - can’t make journal entries - can’t.... unfortunately, the things you can’t do really take away from the other features. i’ve given up trying to use the app, because i kept getting in middle of something and couldn’t take the next logical step.
landscape company. i like this app as it helps me stay on top of the billing before i leave the site. but the client care and billing is horrible customer care is the worst in north america. stay far away from this company. they bill you when they are not suppose to.
mohammed salman 6s. superb app all ledger's are in just my pocket my request is to app developer suppliers options suppliers balance
very good app.. really like this app.
falta información. deberían dar acceso a inventario. aún que sea sin los reportes, para dar una mejor experiencia al usuario y enamorarlo más de app
awesome business app. real time saver with awesome easy features that makes book keeping a breeze.
quality control team is on vacation?. one star to this version because it crashes immediately after i try to open. i deleted it and installed a new version, but same problem. i rebooted my iphone, but same problem. still works on my old ipad because the version is older. force back your quality control team!
slow to respond from time to time .. the app is sometimes slow to respond.
needs a lot of work. needs the ability to update bank accounts from the bank, as for now it only syncs with updates made on my windows or mac computers. needs access to all reports available. i had hoped this app would be a full version substitute when a laptop or desktop computer is not available.
three years using qbo. very dissatisfied.. bugs and more bugs. slow and clunky functionality. bait and switch pricing. no way to communicate effectively with qbo as they are pro forma all about feedback and customer service however the poor souls tasked with providing it have no two way communication with the people who actually code this bug ridden system. i am actively looking for other solutions that provide ipad and iphone data entry. update 2/4/2017. nothing significant has changed. it's very frustrating. i'm really hoping someone else will enter this market with a compatible product. update 3/30/2017. still ridiculous bugs. on home screen every time i open the app i see an error message that says my system has a $10k plus error that needs attention. this has been a bug for almost one year with no fix promised or date to expect any further progress.
very handy. i use quickbooks online and the app on my iphone 6 plus and on my ipad. they work together seamlessly. i am an independent contractor and this fits my business perfectly. i don't deal with inventory, so i can't speak on that part. i invoice for labor mostly. i even created a new client and invoice the other day on my iphone while sitting in a traffic jam. works great. it keeps me informed of past due invoices so that i can follow up with my clients in a timely manner.
great timesaver. i used the free app and i have made up my mind that i will be purchasing this for my small construction business.
awesome. great app for the ipad. i hate complicated software a to tract my work. this ones the most user friendly app i've come across. great recommendation. 5*****'s
rubbish. app crash every second

love it. this app is very helpful for the business side of my lawn care business.
error. the jan 2019 update is plagued with logon issues. i have logged out and deleted the app and then loaded it again on my phone to start fresh. even this does not fix the issue. no matter what, i get a message about critical updates being needed and it logs me out and crashes at each startup.
waste of time!. total waste of time. i like the cd version than the online version. i hope intuit will try to combine the app to include all the features that are on the software version. i am a landscaper and my office needs to be with me outside, not stuck in an office. i need a program where i can take my work with me to my job site. so, when i meet my customers i can give them an an estimate right away on the spot and be able to email to them write away or be able have my customers sign the estimate right away. i would also like do the same with my invoices. it would make it so much easier to count all the footage and labour at the work site - that i don't forget anything and the homeowners can count with me too. on top, i can complete my invoice on the job site and be able to send it to my customers right away. the ipad is much lighter to carry then carrying a laptop. more people are choosing the laptop over the desktop for convenience, in the same way, one day people are going to choose the ipad over the laptop. i hope quickbooks can bring that future now. i just would like to be able to make my invoices and estimates at a job site, where ever that is, and basically be able to edit it and send it to my customers and have my customers sign my estimates on the job site and fix the deal. also i would like to be able to enter in my customers payment right away so i don't have to wait tell i get into the office and then enter that in. as well as, have that information on my app be able to easily transfer to my computer when i am able to get into the office. thanks, but quickbooks should be thanking me because i just showed your companies future -should be headed this way if it is not already thinking of this idea!
why the love. app just doenst work well - slow and just not a great experience.
good. nice app
can't create po's through app. i use quickbooks for 2 things mainly. to create estimates/invoices and send pos once the invoice has been paid. i can't create po's with the app so it's useless. i have to go to the website every time i want to create a po. it makes no sense that they would leave this feature out.
"great for small business...with some accounting background. have been using this for a few months now for my small business. it seems to have most of my needs met very capably, and it definitely has the capacity to grow beyond what i will need in the near future. i am happy with my purchase and choice of accounting software. there are a few opportunities for improvement. while intuit markets this with a ""no accounting background needed"" type of campaign, i wouldn't quite go there. if you have some time to spend educating yourself on some of the accounting basics, it will definitely make your life much happier. they have some very helpful training videos to help but some research on your own (if you have no accounting background) would be highly recommended. without it, you may end up with some bald spots. just sayin! ;-) also, one cannot use the mobile apps (including this ipad app) to do the bookkeeping entries for a credit card like it will for a bank account. even with this application and the online subscription you will be paying for, you will still be stuck having to routinely go to a computer in order to process credit card transactions into your bookkeeping records here. this is a the single largest annoyance for me so far, and really defeats part of the whole point if you are buying this in order to use the app. while it works for a lot of things (and does so very well), you're not going to be able to get very far from your computer for your expenses if you are using a credit card. in the end, it shows a lot of promise. they update it regularly, bringing new features and functionality pretty frequently. fix that credit card functionality and i might even give it five stars."
review this, quickbooks. i was using the app on my ipad, and kept getting a notice to ‘submit a review’. only choice was ‘ not now ‘ . after every transaction, after every page change, the message came up to ‘submit a review’ i pay a monthly subscription, stop bugging me. here’s your review.
nothing syncs. i manage 7 companies with qb online. i recommend qb online to anyone managing a company's finances. this app, however is not good. if you have jobs or sub customers or sub items, they don't sync. invoices paid show as overdue if that customer is a sub customer or is an inactive or deleted customer. void an invoice online, not so fast. it's still there in the app. i tested this app briefly and bought an ipad to be able to manage companies with a quick app interface, not so smart. bottom line, the app needs updates. beware, the data it portrays is not accurate. your customers are not past due so don't call them, they already paid! the app is worthless unless you want to manage a company in its simplest form only using this app. i think an artist at an art fair, a lawn mowing company, a small simple company could use this app and an ipad and be completely mobile.
inferior to qb online on desktop. qb app on ipad or android does not not have even half of the features that qb online has on a desktop. i can manage basic invoicing, basic expenses, see transactions, and pull up basic reports... everything about this app is basic. i have to actually be on my desktop to access the full features of qb online. very dissapointed.
great app but could use some improvement.. this is a great application to have access to while on the go. if it would update the profits and losses more accurately than i believe this would be well worth 5 stars. overall a great app.
great app but signs you out a lot. this is a great app and it works almost perfect but there's one really annoying issue. the app signed you out a lot and doesn't give you the option of entering back in with touch id but rather having to annoyingly enter your password. please fix this as touch id makes life so much more convenient rather than entering your password. doesn't always happen but more often than it should.
do not sign up using the app. signing up from the app store restricts how you can use quickbooks online. you will not be able to change basic setting like email address or password. sign up from a desktop. then you can login to the app later.
rubbish. i hate apps that first want you to sign up before you can try or see info re any costs. this is one of them. i signed up yet still can’t try it as it asks i try a 7 day free trial first. well, i don’t mind but i’d like to see what i’m getting before signing my life away. i don’t want every app to have my email. as it is, after all the signing up this app isn’t what i want and is too fussy. next !!!!!!!
tax rates/counties are incorrect. when i create an invoice from this app, it doesn’t select the correct county even when i manually change it. it causes it to transfer back to desktop version as the wrong county when saved and will not account for that county. please fix 10/8/19 ***still not fixed*** this has been going on for the better of 6 months..why hasn’t this been fixed?? the app keeps sending the wrong county information to the main server which causes me to manually have to change it from the desktop version. i can’t change it manually from the app. this makes my job harder and i have complained several times...i understand there can be bugs, but this has been a known issue and still not addressed.
ok. app ok
"not as good as i thought, but better. i tried a few apps/softwares, but i stopped here. the downside is that it makes you a little bit lazy and have more free time, so people think you are not doing a big job? say if i can get all; 1. all expenses with their attachments organised in one place 2. all invoices and their attachments 3. all bank accounts - even personal accounts to allocate transactions relate to business - and without a need to ""data entry"" 4. my bas can be done in a few min 5. my chart of accounts can be amended as i go from everywhere 6. plenty of reports are ready at any time 7. one look at one graph, i can know what's up. plenty of other features and i like this app"
great. makes invoices and estimates from phone look right professional. i use the desktop version as well and it would be great if the different versions spoke to each otherwise best solution by far
awesome app. this is a brilliant app. i have all my invoices and expenses at my fingertips. very easy to use and synchs perfectly with qbo on my mac. keeps me on track with daily reminders of overdue invoices. no one gets away with not paying me now.
so far so good. very good for tracking expenses on the road to avoid paperwork when back at the office. nice simple mobile interface.
changed our business. from the first version of this app with the online version of quickbooks, this has changed our business. no more scribbled notes on sticky paper or back of a student roster. sales are done immediately and nothing is lost or forgotten. my only request is to please add time tracking fit our instructors into the app, then it would be perfect!
good, not great. you can do the basics, like sync bank accounts, run a few basic reports. but you can’t take many useful actions or get reliable search results. the bank accounts render weirdly. it’s more like a novelty rather than a tool.
useless. i have used qb online for many years, and i’m very happy with it. the app is useless to me though, since the interface is way too limited. for example, one good use for it would be to enter receipts on the fly, but much to my disappointment i couldn’t do something as simple as to pull up a list of accounts to assign the cost to. entering receipts would be a perfect use for a mobile app, but i simply can’t do it correctly. i mean, what did intuit really think it was going to be used for? also, the payment methods i have set up in qb online are not available in the app, all you see is credit, check or cash. it seems like the app doesn’t synch fully with your online info, which makes you wonder what kind of mess it can create in your bookkeeping. strangely enough, when i started the app it said that it was synching with my data, but it appears that this was just the basic data and none of my personal account settings. it’s entirely possible that i have missed some of the finer details, but they really messed up the app by making the interface so different from the computer based online version. having to learn and keep up with two versions is just too cumbersome for a small business owner like me, so this app is now deleted. calling it a bookkeeping app is grossly misleading, since it’s so limited.
makes it easy. so glad i decided to go with quickbooks, update daily to keep track of expenses and sales. fantastic for my business.
perfect!. great app with all the functionality i need to take care of business. i can do much of my books on the go and not let things pile up. love this app!
so cool, so simple, so effective... in the simplest of terms a really rewarding and almost uplifting piece of software that looks so cool and accomplished to your clients and prospects that even the simplest of estimates or invoices, imparts an image of uncanny levels of professionalism and efficiency. in practice it is a simple delighted to use and i could not be more pleased with this lovely piece of software. i'm sure there must be many shortcomings and shortfalls of which i'm not aware, but all i can say is it ticks all the boxes for me, after spending a quite ridiculous amount of time investigating all the viable options and alternatives available. highly recommended.
the best app out there by far. the app is excellent for anyone on the go. easy to upload info from the app. user friendly. tried a few other book keeping apps and found this to be the best by far. gets even better every download. 1 issue(for me) is that i can't attach a pdf to invoices using a device. would be 5⭐️ if the next update includes this.
great app. this is a great app for small businesses.
brilliant mobile app. it has changed my life . i am able to do quotes in the run and save so much valuable time .
before update great after horrible. i have been using quickbooks for over 15 years. there always coming out with something new and most the time it works very well. this particular update makes it so i cannot except credit card payments via the app anymore. trying to get in touch with customer support or get any help on this issue has been a few hours of wasted time. still don't know what's going on i'm assuming this is their a way to force go payment users to buy the new chip reader so they can continue to except credit cards in day-to-day business. if you're reading this trying to decide to update and you use the standard headphone jack card reader and want to still receive payments via the app do not download this update.
good app i’ve grown fond of. makes my life 5 times easier. definitely worth the money
great app. i compared couple of similar products and quickbooks was defiantly the best. i still believe that they could enhance their app to have identical features of their web version.
good app. app does what it says it will do!
"dissapointing. update- now my ipad ap asks me to rate it, but it locks the whole screen up. kills me. used to love this ap. but it has been garbage for some time now. takes forever to login and load on my iphone (even slower on my ipad). once you are finally in adding new customers or saving estimates is just as bad. have called customer support to find out what is going on and received the response ""we know about the issue and we are working on it"". this was over two months ago. i was added to their escalation list and have yet to receive an update. horrible customer service. actively looking for a different direction for our business."
signed out. every time i launch the app i have been signed out due to critical updates. i sign back in and before i can even pull up an invoice i have been signed out again. if i switch to another app and switch back i am signed out again. sometimes when i switch back into the app i’m left with a blurred screen and have to force close the app and relaunch which again signs me out. this is getting ridiculous and hurting my work flow extremely. the mac os app isn’t any better either.
"forced to upgrade to ios 9 - pathetic!. i personally like the ipad app better than the online version for interface, but it has so many bugs! constantly gives me error message that i'm not authorized to do something (add/edit a customer, etc.), but then it lets me do it. but i keep having to close out all the error messages that pop up. often won't let me email an invoice. won't let me add customer off of creating a new estimate (have to add customer, close, then do estimate and choose customer again). the list of basic things that should not be an issue goes on and on. on the iphone app, there is no place for my reps to view the contact person's name at the company! i'm sure there are other things i could think of, but i've just learned to compensate and work around things. however an app with this many bugs should not be out there - it's pretty pathetic! update 11/18/15 - after update, all the previous bugs are still there. pathetic to issue an update and not fix what was wrong! update 1/14/16 - even worse! now i can no longer add an item to an estimate or see the customer name on estimates or invoices under ""activity"". what is wrong with you people? if you can't make it better, leave it alone! now it is completely useless! update 11/7/16 - i absolutely hate you for forcing me to upgrade to ios 9!!! i have been suffering with quickbooks ipad's pathetic bugs for well over a year. i am forced to use it for my job because my laptop is old and i hardly ever pull it out anymore. everything i do is on my ipad. however, i have an older model (not by years, but by model) and after the mess updating to ios 8.3 created for me, i vowed i would never update again! none of the other apps on my ipad have forced me to do this. app developers are generally sensitive to the fact that not everyone chooses to disrupt their life by updating their device and spending days having to learn to use it all over again (and deal with whatever new bugs it brings to the table). you must have the absolutely lowest level of developers out there who first, couldn't fix even simple bugs in your app (like telling me every time i set up a customer or did an estimate ""i wasn't authorized to do it"" and then warning me if i got out of it all data would be lost. but it wasn't and everything i did was still in the system. even our boss got this message and she is the administrator). there were a myriad of other quirks we had to work around and now your solution is to release a new version, but in so doing force everyone to upgrade to ios 9 because your developers weren't smart enough to know how to make it work with previous ios versions??? shame on you! you would get 0 stars in my review if i could and if this new version isn't totally bug free, you will really hear from me!"
very happy. this app makes my accounting work super easy, can't wait for all features to be available on the app.
won't let us start a new tax rate. the best app will not allow us to start collecting taxes. every time we initiate the tax rate and try to save it it simply says it cant perform that function please go to settings and let us know. it's ridiculous that a book keeping app as large as qb's is that such remedial tasks are often frustrating.
best business app. i never write reviews but had to for quickbooks. absolutely love. couldn't run my business without it. have recommend it to everyone.
"quickbooks: decent ideas, horrible execution. the app is ok when it works, which is less time than when it doesn't work. intuit is nothing more than a bloated corporate bureaucracy that has a relatively captive audience, so it's unlikely they'll do anything to improve their products until people start leaving them en masse for alternatives like sage or xero. some of the ideas within the qbo app are good, but when your customer can't pay your invoice because the intuit systems are ""temporarily unavailable"" all day long, you're going to have a cash flow problem. even aesthetically speaking, the app is cluttered and tries to pack too much into it (except for the stuff you really need to be there). i am an accountant and will stick with quickbooks until my last client migrates to xero or sage, then i'm leaving too and won't look back."
where is the payroll functionality?!?!. the app seems to intentionally not include payroll functionality, that’s what i need most! f-
so far so good.. love the app. i think it's great any time i can give an estimate, invoice on the road. thanks.
great app!!. just switched from quicken, and i don't know why i waited so long. qb is very versatile and comprehensive.
small business owner. this app is perfect! 100% of what i need all the time!
not bad, not amazing. it's quick books. the app gives you access to some information, but not everything.
great small business tool. excellent on a laptop, dient handel banks with authentication dongles very well, mobile app doesn't handle them at all. can't do payroll from mobile. receipt tracking is easy and works well. reports and snap shots handy.
easy to use. great app to use
good but needs improvements. great app for small businesses, but should have a feature to customize invoice with a job location on the header not in a small custom field box, also would like to see a disclaimer format to add with invoice

incomparable with ipad pro. this app works terrible with ipad pro. basically made this business expense a complete waste as the app and web program useless on the ipad pro. extremely disappointed and frustrated.
fab. brilliant app that updates instantly, giving a visual handle on your business at any time. thank you
app isn’t working now. please advise. it has stopped working. i click on the app and it automatically closes. new iphone today should work unless not compatible with ios13.
super easy. great app and accounts program - easy to use after a small amount of training. so far i haven’t come across any of those annoying bugs you get in other accounts apps
minor flaws happy with product. when adding a note to a customer file ie invoice or estimate the app seems to struggle to keep up... typing is really slow and sluggish ipad retina third-generation
great app. does cost money this app. it’s definitely worth it! the app keeps up to date
shiny useless tool. this app looks awesome. very well thought out design and it appears that most of the functions are right at my fingertips. not so. i have used it mostly for categorizing expenses. i was trying to run a report, but nothing really made sense. i went first to google to look for some tutorial videos, but it appears that most of the videos available online are only advertisements. that is when i went to the help and support section in app. in the section there is a faqs area. perfect! when i read the only article in this section i thought it must be some kind of joke. it was an article on how to get to the faqs section on the app. it is like some perverted groundhog day scene, or like when you are reviewing a resume for a potential new hire and one of the sections is the filler text from the template they created the resume from. i expect more from this company. fix this or simply remove it.
poor invoicing. the ideas on this app seem great but in reality don't deliver. linking bank accounts doesn't really work (for my hsbc business account). other major problems include: not adding dates to individual entries for labour costs or time. invoice template can't be added to or edited so you can't add add your payment details to inform clients how to even pay the invoice you're sending!? a few other issues which is really annoying- could be a good app but there's a lot to resolve before i would recommend
need options to customize invoices. please add more options to customize invoices. i need to add secondary contact information such as name, address and phone, along with the regular billing address. also, i would like to modify the invoice number. otherwise, this app is great for field use with my ipad+cellular. it has saved me tons of time compared with working on my laptop and quickbooks desktop.
great app. best software for small business, better priced than other software on the market.
handy app.. i've struggled for a while with record keeping and this app makes it very easy to keep records and do my day to day book keeping.
please update. please update app or bring previous version constantly downloading customer data that takes forever and then get errors please fix quick
happy with the app. i’ve used for quickbooks and the app for a year now and it has really helped my business and is a easy way to keep track of customers and quotes
good. nice app
only basics. the app appears to make available only the very basic functions. i don't see reports, and i signed on to complete some company preferences, add classes, and set opening chart of accounts. none of these are functional.
nothing good to say. nothing good to say about the app, the cloud version or the mac version of quickbooks. and i’ve used every version they hawked at me. some business don’t have inventory and sell products. and they just need a simple software solution to manage expenses and bill time and material and labor, send estimates and write checks. everything else rendered absolutely unnecessary. even the most “basic” version offered by them is still crowded with absolutely ridiculous and unnecessary features and you have to pay for them. and the apps interface is way to complicated and lacking because of it. and the visiting the mobile site is no better. i just honestly don’t see how so many people are complacent.
mgrm. great app. useful and easy to use. sample and easy to use
geeat. awesome app...!!!!!!
does not function. doesn't load new invoices. app is now useless.
clunky and awkward. app can be awkward to navigate.
looking for a personal budgeting app. i have spent months looking for a personal budgeting app to replace quicken personal plus. i did like this app a lot, but it didn't do what i needed. ended up switching to boomeringo which links into my bank to get all of my current transactions plus the ability to fully customise categories and very sophisticated budgeting.
"app doesn't work. after speaking with the help desk the advise i got was ""the app must not compatible with your phone (iphone 6 plus)"". i leave this review as i only signed up with quickbooks to manage my businesses accounts ""on the go"" and it's been a waste of money for this purpose"
"latest upgrade is a disgrace. i have never written a negative review of an upgrade, but the latest version of this app made a great app totally useless. you can no longer receive invoices or reconcile bank balances. do yourself a favor and delete the quickbooks app rather than ""upgrade."" the mobile website is more useful than the app."
getting better. you can keep doing more and more on phone. great for us small business owners. it would be 5 but when i first downloaded there was not a lot to transactions you could complete on app.
amazing!. this app undoubtedly helps running multiple businesses on the road possible! when i finally switched my businesses from desktop to online there were a few things missing. i wrote a few complaints and spoke with their development team...few short months later...boom! additions were made! one if which is being able to switch businesses within the app. definitely much easier than logging in and out all the time.
quickbooks online. qbol is totally different from the standard desktop version of qb. i like some of the features such as directly updating my accounts by getting the latest transactions directly from my bank and from paypal. but there were a lot of mess ups due to me not knowing what qbol was doing too. thus many duplicate transactions. i think i have a handle on it now (i say that every month). the app for ipad works better that the desktop browser version for most of the common items, but some features just seem to be missing.
business changer. changing the way i do business. my first sale paid for the app.
works exactly as accounting software should. i installed qb with some trepidation. i was sceptical as i have been of invoicing software in the past. they've usually promised a lot, but delivered very differently in real world situations. however from the time i installed qb, it's worked brilliantly for me. the ability to customise various accounting heads, the intuitiveness and simplicity, yet power of the mobile ipad app has been a revelation. we're in the first fiscal year of using this software and converting from our manual accounting methods, but so far with us being in the third quarter of the fiscal, the software, reports and everything about the software has worked as it should! it has taken the pain out of manual accounting and manual report generation entirely! get your accounting systems up and running on qb. you won't regret it!
terrible support - avoid. terrible, terrible support. continual promises of call backs from customer support agents on live chat never happen because the bugs you find are too hard. open tickets for bugs never get resolved. you ask for a supervisor or manager and you have to email the person you’re complaining about?! get told that because of system bugs you have to manually delete the key back in multiple entries. you’ll be left at year end with books that don’t balance like me. avoid!
can't live without it. i don't know how i did business before this app. i love that i can access my company books anywhere. i love the way i can take a photo of the receipts for my expenses. thank you qb!
best app. love this app makes it easy for me to track all my buisness transactions. recommend
"a lesson in poor user design.. this review is not about quickbook's design regarding the recording and posting of entries. quickbook's is deserving of this one-star review because of the terrible experience i had today with their customer service and subscription processing that snowballed into a 2-hour ordeal. i want to preface by saying i had the pleasure of meeting a few lead ux designers for turbotax so i was actually biased for quickbooks prior to this. my free trial expires in two days and i had planned the whole time to pay, i just procrastinated on doing so. today, however, i attempted to log-on and was greeted with a ""trial has expired"" message. 1) this happened 2 days before my trial period ended 2) i couldn't log in to pay because my trial expired. i later discovered this was because i initially set-up the account on ios, but there was no message to indicate this to me at the time, and i was forced to wallow in my frustrations. after repeated attempts to log in i was able to get into my qb online account when i accessed the site through my history.(not sure how that worked but that’s not the point here.) i finally get in and hit the “subscribe now” button and enter my payment information. i get a “something’s wrong, please re-enter your payment information.” so i do so. and i do it again. still nothing. i switch to my credit card. still nada. i then tried to go into settings and access the subscription tab but it wasn’t there, which after some googling i discovered was probably because i opened the account on the ios app. figured this was also why it wasn’t accepting my payment information. all of this trouble just to pay for the service. but don’t worry, it didn’t end there. so my itunes account is attached to my family payment method, which i don’t want paying for quickbooks. i would like to pay for my accounting app with my business account—makes sense right? well, you have to pay through itunes if you open your account on ios. so i get support on the line and “message an agent,” meticulously explaining my issue. we go back and forth and he tells me that i have to contact itunes if i’m having trouble changing my payment method(not what the problem was). from the message you can tell he really doesn’t understand at all what i’m saying, and he was frustrated by that and was rude because of it. i tell him that i would not like to change my itunes payment, that i’m trying not to pay through itunes because i want to use my business account. he leaves me on read. wonderful. so instead i ask support for a callback. a very kind lady takes my case and after spending quite a bit of time trying to figure out what to do she’s about to walk me through what she thinks is a solution when my wifi goes out, so i told her i’d have to call back. and that’s where i am now. point: i spent nearly 2 hours trying to just pay for a subscription. absolutely ridiculous. 1)trial ended early 2)couldn’t log into account to pay 2.5)didn’t tell me to try my ios app 3)just let me mindlessly enter my payment information without telling me that it was never going to work because i have to pay through itunes 4)nobody at quickbooks thought that a business owner wouldn’t want to pay through their itunes account? 5)disappearing subscription tab without an explanation other than in the forums 6)a rude, confused, and unhelpful customer service agent"
getting better with every upgrade.. great app. they do lure you with the free use then hit ya with the charges later. i think it's a useful tool in the toolbox.
like the app. i find the app to be very useful in the field. unfortunately since the latest update adding new customers seem to slow the app down and to a crawl. wish there was a way to get that bug fixed
app is crashing.... had to key in a credit card thru the computer because the app keeps crashing and doesn’t let you charge a card. will change my review after they fix the issue.
prestige. this app is awesome! i work on my books as well as my clients. i'm surprise that i can do all from my phone! mrs. jordan
very efficient. very efficient app, very handy
ios 13. i’ve updated my iphone 8 to ios 13 and quickbooks won’t load at all. i’ve deleted and re uploaded the app and it’s the same. any updates coming soon for the app? other than that, don’t update your phone if you rely on quickbooks in your phone
very fluid, works just like mint.com, but for business!. i've been using quickbooks for a little while now, and i'm very impressed. i really enjoy using intuits product mint.com, and the interface is very similar. the thing i like about qbo is that i can easily accept transactions while invoicing and saving pictures of my receipts is a complete breeze. there are some things you're not able to do in the mobile app yet, like adding product groups, but it's easy enough to log onto a browser to get those things done. will definitely continue using.
great app but not perfect yet. if they add more customization to this app like adding letterhead to purchase order and provide educational videos on every topic it would make a best app ever.
awesome app!. i love this app. the ability to check the status of an invoice or review an expense on the go is amazing.
just started with it.. can i attach a file to an invoice that i create with the app? i don’t see the option and we need to be able to do this or this app/program won’t work for us.
fantastic accounting app. i love that this allows me the freedom to work and to monitor my accountant's progress on the go. it's extremely user friendly and easy to use. many features save tons of time on simple book keeping tasks. smashes traditional softwares like ubs and myob into the dust!
"yay...it's working again!!. qbs has been quite efficient and easy to use! i appreciate like the constant improvements!! however, note to developer...i wish this app gave ""real time"" reminds/notices of when to bill a client based on days, just to make it more customized???!? maybe add a calendar with an to synchronize with the personal/ipad calendars??? i down know, i just find myself calculating day for my customized client each time, instead of just getting a notification. thank, still love this app!!!"
so much potential!. i went from desktop to online. what a nightmare! well, i’m really liking the speed at which i can create and send/print an invoice now that i’m getting used to it and have some of the kinks worked out. but......there is so much more this app should be able to do!! the accounts are not updated. when i do transactions on chrome or safari, the app is about a month behind even though the balance is correct. transactions just done shoe!? you can’t do any transfers between my accounts. i have to go onto safari and then there is a whole other set of issues! even when using chrome on ipad pro you still can’t see the whole page or “buttons” to click to save something....over all i’m getting better at using the mobile version but it really needs work for ipad version to flow like it does online on a laptop! (which is what i’m trying to get away from) anxious for a good big update.
poor. very poor, looks good, loads not available via app, buggy things get repeated after purge, why there isn’t a test drive feature that doesn’t perm add and clears when turned off is beyond me. phone support terrible, tell them using app and answer is use web browser on a pc, why have an app if core functionality is unavailable. pointless the self employed app is a bit better but no ipad app, it at least has ocr for receipts and auto cat’ing them. if it wasn’t for mtd being pushed in april then i would leave qb alone unti it is more mature
pointless. useless app. can’t even see any supplier invoices etc. what is the point of having the app if you can’t work fully on the go!?
great efficient and cost effective. this app is great and accounting system is too. best value for the money and easy to use.
it’s great. although this program works incredibly well and i’m happy to of used it for the past two years… i would love to do an annual subscription, pay my payment once a year and carry-on.
good expense tracker. good for tracking expensing. everything else really needs to be done from the desktop version. handy little app, but it needs some work to truly run things from this app.
just awful!!!. is this seriously how you're going to roll out your app by pissing off customers. can't even sign in half the time due to 'connection errors'. your company is an ultra fail.
crashes too much, stressful. doing accounting is difficult enough. why did quickbooks create an app that crashes and creates frustration then?! this is not my phone's problem, because i have the latest apple model.
jason marquez. this app according to me is best as it's not that complicated and makes my business easy, i've not used any other accounting app so i consider this very easy for any layman who is not very good in accounting. it could have had few more options like individual job closing so to get more accurate and decrease the paper work.
incredible. this is an incredible application. if you're looking to intuitively streamline your business this is definitely the app for you!
keeps crashing. update: it’s still crashing. i can’t upload any receipts from my phone. 🤬 what’s the point of using it if i can’t upload my receipts! every time i try to upload a receipt from my phone, it crashes when i press save & doesn’t save at all. i’ve tried closing the app & trying again, but it does it every time, so basically i can’t take a picture of any receipt & upload it. please fix! update: i still can’t upload a receipt unless i take a picture of it elsewhere & upload vs taking a picture of it on the app.
"update broke the app. since the update i have to type my password each time i open it after it has been closed for a while. this doesn't work in front of customers. (yes, i enabled touchid. the problem seem to be hitting others and is based on now intuit decided to ""fix"" touchid by breaking it in this version)"
makes accounting a breeze. this app is great. link it to your account and it quickly learns how to categorize your expenses. then all you have to do is confirm or adjust as needed. 👍👍
great app!!. i love it! this program has totally transformed our family business!!
so easy to go work with!!!. as a new business owner this app makes the process of dealing with the administrative side of it easy and convenient!
great app. best app ever for a mobile business.
better than others. i do recommend qb online and from my desktop it works perfect. but for an intuit product and compared to the desktop version, trying to work on my ipad, it sure doesn't do all it should. it took quite a while to figure out the quirks and logistics of the app, i'm still annoyed with the lack of certain features after a year of use. like why i can't print directly from my ipad/iphone which is what i mainly use. and i don't like the form layouts, and that it's hard to change the shipping address under the same client from the app. but, it does sync well with the web/ipad/iphone and does a reasonable job of keeping things organized, which is very important and the problem i had with the previous app we tried.
when it works. i rely heavily on the quickbooks mobile app. when it works, it works great. but every once in a while, it goes down, for days.
couldn't run my business without it!. this is an incredible program! my favorite thing about it is how mobile it is. my business is all out in the field... so i'm always creating invoices, collecting payment, and writing receipts often times right in front of my clients. i can literally do each one of these tasks in less than one minute. customers are impressed, records are kept up-to-date, and my mind is at peace. very satisfied!
quick books app. absolutely love this app, its works fabulously well on my iphone, and i can process things quickly and easily without having the panic of having to beside the computer 24/7. great
doesn't work. app doesn't sync all data with quickbooks online. i see only my company name and customer list. no invoices, expenses etc. intuit support we're not able to help.
great app!!!!. very happy with the app works great and allows for same functionality as desk top
awoolridge. i like the app and actually find it easier to record payments from customers than the online version. however, it is frustrating that you cannot perform all duties ie. creating estimates and invoices etc.. let's ramp it up qb. ;-)
ios 13 incompatible. was using this app, working fine on my ipad with ios 12 but updated phone to ios 13 and will not load app but crashes every time i open it. i’m not paying for a dud app. fix it or refund my subscription.
awesome. such a great package. it made my life so easy with the phone app that i can raise invoices and quotes on the go. it also makes your business look heaps bigger and professional by having proper invoicing that allows taking signature on quotes too. loving it.
sneaky subscription fees and invoicing not adequate. i never write reviews but this has bugged me. so i’d heard of qb once before and have seen them advertised as being useful for business owners and the self employed. i decided yesterday to download and give it ago. you’re greeted with a 30 day free trial and then once proceeding and setting up your account you are immediately pressured into buying a “40% discounted” subscription of £5.99 or face paying £9.99 per month forever. so i agreed to it assuming it would be a useful tool and that naturally like any other subscription company the charging period would begin following the 30 day free trial giving you breathing space to cancel if it wasn’t fit for purpose. well this is not the case. as soon as you commit to the subscription it begins charging you and waived and free trial period! sneaky and underhand move there. also - when actually trying the software i tried to add an invoice to my account that i had sent a client recently. it wouldn’t let me add any additional lines onto the invoice which meant i could only add one cost and notes section completely missing the point of being able to break down various different costs on the one same invoice, such as expenses/sales etc. how stupid. on top of this the advertising didn’t make it clear there are two separate apps (business and self employed) so after downloading the quickbooks app and going through the above it turns out that one is just for business use not self emp. please amend the app title in the app store. i’ve got a refund from apple for the above but this shouldn’t have to happen. please leave your underhand tactics at the door and play it fair like any other subscription service.
fix finally now i can get back to work.. this version fixed the errors from the last update. glad it working again. quickbooks has been good except the last update. this one fixed the issue. we us this app for our onsite business and it's great. several times i would send an invoice to the customer when i'm leaving their home and before i get to the next job it's already paid. update. does not work again. :(
this app does not function properly on ios13. i cannot view any customer files. i can search for them, but the app will not let me click on a customer to edit invoices.
"okay...when it works. i would really love to be able to use quickbooks, but instead i have to waste my time on the ""free trial"" (that tries to convince you to buy it immediately with sale pricing), by constantly locking myself out of my bank account. i can't even log into my bank via the quickbooks ipad app now, because it just keeps getting my account suspended. verifying the login information does nothing. the app keeps glitching, and it's definitely frustrating. while only a trivial thing, they want you to buy into the app, so it is constantly trying to sell you. that's fine, i understand how sales work. what gets me is they offer a 30-day free trial, but the moment you create an account they offer you that sale pricing i mentioned. however, if you buy into the ""act fast pricing,"" you don't get a free trial at all. nothing mentions that. it isn't a ""pay now and you get this pricing after your free trial."" is intuit that desperate for money? they also emailed me an offer for a free card reader for mobile. another one of those things that no matter how many times i pressed process, filled out my information, and checked out, the website kept telling me it can't process for whatever reason. first my address was wrong. then my payment information was wrong (i never got prompted for payment info until after that error). then i just gave up. so many hassles and they don't seem to be worth the effort. i'll continue the trial, then probably move on."
great app for any small business. this is a well polished app with regular updates and new features being added everyday. *credit card transactions are incredibly simple with the intuit gopayment integration. great job on the app guys keep up the good work!
"great app for distributors. we can invoice and deliver on the fly without having to go back to the office to capture the ""in the moment sales"". our accountant has access and was able to set our account up to match his categories for a fast and no worry tax prep."
good but frustrating.. no access to vendor information or purchase orders on an iphone or ipad. have complained about this for nearly 2 years. falling on deaf ears. they agree that it would make sense but there is no one that gives a *%!£ to do anything. 3/13/2017 have now a problem accessing qb online since yesterday. download company on either the iphone or ipad takes an hour or more and on certain devices never will. customer service doesn't have a clue what is happening. we have all gone multiple resets and all other aspects of the devices operate correctly. extremely upsetting on an extremely busy monday.
best accounting app. perfect for any small business. never had any problem, never crashes. only need more invoicing templates.
ipad app. please update your app to be more like the desktop version...i can not track inventory received through the ipad app i purchased and ipad pro hoping to do away with my laptop and so far its been seamless, except for this app not being able to track inventory received. i hope your developers can figure this out before my 8 year old laptop crashes! thanks
excellent. excellent app
time saver. our customers are loving our new system
pay attention to billing ~ unethical business practices. intuit upgrades subscription and charges more than advertised price when you are not looking. horrible customer service - unable to reach by phone to resolve their seemingly intentional billing errors. they practice unethical business behavior, but switching costs are very high once accounts are set up.
great app!. very user-friendly and convenient. great for people who are needing to create invoices and estimates and track expenses. the iphone app is fantastic!
best accounting software i've tried. this has got to be the most intuitive feature rich reasonably priced cloud computing package for small business i've ever seen. waaay better than myob, such a great little app.
app. grate app worth purchasing i'd recommend this to anyone
fantastic app for my ipad pro!. i recently acquired an ipad pro to use for my business and instantly downloaded quickbooks to use on the go. this app has been wonderful for sending invoices, logging my expenses, and managing the books in general. so far, i have yet to experience a crash and everything has been working well for my needs!
"took money. loved the app until it was time to get paid through the app. my client's payment was deducted from their account 5 days ago. after providing information about my client, along with 6 months of bank statements, i was told that i should be paid 5 days from now, but according to the user agreement, it may be longer. intuit is holding on to my money that the client had paid to me for services rendered. i'm switching to freshbooks for invoicing, and opening a chase quickpay account or find some other method of payment. waiting for a paper check in the mail would be easier and more reliable than this garbage. like, i said, it was a great app, until it was time to get paid, which is the point of working. their only explanation has been ""your account was flagged by our computer."""
the worst customer service ever. don’t waist your time. trust my word. update. i’m paying for 3 of the same app now and still can’t get any help.
quick books makes my life easier!. doing estimates and sending invoices is easier then ever!
needs more functions. not a bad app but is lacking better search modes. there needs to be a way to look up customers by address or phone numbers. also, many of our customers have multiple rentals, buildings, apartments etc. there isn't anyway to keep these addresses under the same customer. i have to look at each and every invoice to find the address in the memo section. i don't like having to start the search all over again when i have looked up a customer with the same last name and it's not the correct one.
ash c. i find the app is very hit and miss sometimes simply logging in is a issue! there are features missing such as adding bills and the slow speeds often cause simple tasks to take an unacceptable amount of time. the qbo system is rarely able to update banking transactions on the first attempt and can take up to 7 days with numerous attempts before the transactions will download. other issues such as the vat section being inaccessibility for an number of days also happens on a regular basis. contact with the tech team normally involves explaining the issues a number of times to many different operatives before final giving up and hoping they finally sort the glitches out in their own time! i will be looking for a suitable alternative that does not hinder my booking keeping.
give me a refund. i hate this app it’s trash an i want my money back !!!
superb. the app on the iphone is great. works perfectly and great for quick invoicing. the ipad app is even better as provides much more in depth information. even better both apps work seamlessly with each other. don't know what i would do without this app.
new update horrible. it's always been glitch but since the new update i can't add products to the estimate and customer service is clue less in how to resolve the issue.
solid for business. great app for a small non-profit. easy to navigate and i appreciate the prompts!
good but has a few flaws. overall this app is great for its purpose but the biggest issue is the inability to add gst to invoices. it makes the app almost useless, unless you go out of your way to add the cost of gst as an extra line item in the invoice, but then you have to explain that to your clients which is not very professional looking. without that ability it's kind of just an expensive mileage and expense tracker (it is a good tracker though). i hope they improve this app a bit more because it could be perfect.
dangerous. this app would like customer number, passcode and security number if you want to sync bank accounts. this has been confirmed by lloyds, bank of scotland and santander that doing this is dangerous. as you are giving them information they need to access your account and if anything went missing you would not be protected and this information should not be inserted at anytime
nice app. this is a really good app and i would give it five stars except i keep getting an error message when opening up certain accounts from the chart of accounts.
not working. i've been a customer of quickbooks online pretty much since it came out. the opportunity to use my mobile phone to access quickbooks while i was out and about seemed fantastic. when it's working it's fab. but recently ( the last 4 weeks at least) the app has failed to download my data and won't refresh. saying unexpected error. so i am unable yet again (this has happened before) to access my data. the last time it happened it lasted a few months then suddenly it started working again. i had contacted intuit regarding this and actually the techie from quickbooks online that i spoke to gave up and suggested i contact intuit direct. this is very disappointing as i spend £30 / month to enable me to access my data where ever i am. and it's not letting me do that.
no sales receipts. this app is pretty decent, but lacks the essential functionality of sales receipts. gopayment isn't a solution either because it doesn't link to customers. when can we expect sales receipt functionality?
need improvement asap. need to approve the app asap due to many loss of customers. disappointed of the high price.
amazing product. great product for a small company. combining quickbooks online with the phone app is a great tool. being able to look up customers, create invoices, email invoices anywhere you want. i am also excited to be able to pair qb online payment with this also. all in all it's a great product for a great price so many things you can do with it.
decent app missing features. overall the app works good. i wish it had some of the website features such as the ability to post deposits considering depositing money is a mobile activity.
landscaping on the run. always busy. not a lot of time set aside for paperwork. i'm loving the convenience of this app
very nice!. i love have this power in my phone! i can email invoices or print them out, all on my phone! this app is easy to learn and soooooo fast when you get used to it. there was a lot of thinking when they designed this app, wow
update killed the app. after this last update i can't save to add payments or invoices. can't even take a credit card. it's killing me.
simple and efficient. this makes invoicing on the go so simple. i love that it syncs with my computer and i can take a photo of receipts and it adds them to my expenses. very convenient
amazing accounting software for smbs. great capabilities and integrations. only downside is the ios app is not always reflecting all data from the software. i believe this will be fixed soon
couldn't ask for more. vary good app with great integration with cloud web service. i have been using this app along with desktop cloud version with my business for little more then a year now and find it vary useful and the app tops it off being on the road with no access to computer as long as they continue to upgrade and offer quickbooks online with app i will subscribe
business owner must have. great app to work on the go. create, modify and email invoices. keep track of anything financial on your handheld device. fully automated office on the go for the busy self employed entrepreneur.
crash flow. all the time. when will i stop banging my head against the wall using this app. i’ve tried everything to resolve the crashing issue on this app and still it crashes and still i go back only to have my work lost over and over again hoping that this time it wont crash mid invoice or estimate. please let us know when intuit can develop an app that works. and lower your credit card rates too, why don’t ya?! intuit has so many different ways and apps and products... please just do what you’re supposed to do well, like a functioning quickbooks.
app is great, but.... it is incredibly annoying that i have to sign in with my password every time i open the app now. before the update, i could use a pin or touch id, which don't seem to be working. i contacted customer service twice and have heard nothing back.
access to qb contacts please. love this app, means i can work while out with the kids. would be better if my phone was allowed access to my quickbooks contacts as my husband adds the contacts and they call before i have chance to add them to my phone.
convenient accounting app. super usefull app, get you at the top of your finances, recommended!!!
best mobile accounting app. great improvements in the latest version. easily the best ipad/iphone app for accounting, that sits well alongside the full featured qbo software.
good app and great support. easy to use although experienced problem with vat rate not being editable in online desktop version. intuit' response was really quick and efficient and friendly. highly recommend.
simplicity and ease. i am new to quickbooks online but absolutely love how simple the app is. it creates time and space in my personal life.
only real option for online small business bookkeeping. quickbooks on line is really the only workable online bookkeeping solution for small business. it still needs a lot of work to make it worth what they charge for it. also be very careful when upgrading from one level to another. a very slick customer service rep had me upgrade to a level of service that cost twice what i was paying claiming that i would have a certain functionality that i needed. in the end, not only did i not get what i needed, but i could not return to the basic level, unless i wanted to close out my account and loose all my data. still all this being said, as far as i can tell it is the best of what is being offered as a web based service.
good app. i have used this now for two years. it works well.
convenient. qbo is very convenient for checking biz summary on the go. especially if you are traveling and client asking for some info. invoicing is pretty easy too.
great app. easy accounting program to implement and run with. great to have access across all my devices.
book keeping made easy. with constant updates this is the go to program for my business! this app assists in daily activity and allows me to be on the move.
quickbooks. great app. excellent business account program to run my business from my iphone.
research before you buy. program works ok but has a high learning curve. also apps have restrictions on what you can do. cannot post new checks in apps. cannot log onto the website from a mobile device. reports are limited. i do not do invoicing and use it mostly for my accountant, and i'm still learning so the final jury is still out but from what i've seen so far i can't give it a higher rating.
it works ok. using this app for serval years now. mainly i’m bothered by the small glitches and performance of the app, not so much quickbooks. every so often a new annoyance will pop up.
ipad trouble. i’ve been using the self employed app for almost two years. i had some issues with crossover between a new mac and my iphone. though a painful process, tech support eventually fixed it. now after downloading the app on ipad, the app won’t work on the ipad. says mobile access isn’t available. well what have i been doing on my phone for two years then?
ios 13 not supported. the app will not even start!
best app. very helpful online support
perfect software for the right companies. i absolutely love it! i have a small freelance design company, so i'm billing for services and commissions. there is nothing i need that it doesn't do and do well. i don't need inventory, estimates or payroll, so this program is about as friendly to me as it could possibly be.
not accurate. even after the most recent update the app still dose not accurately reflect my qbo account. all information on vended and clients are not up to date. this had been an ongoing issue for more than a year now. i keep hoping with every update this will be correct, but nothing yet.
app does not allow long passwords. i use long, cryptographically complex passwords that are unique to each website i visit. this is especially true for financial institutions. quickbooks has done something in their ios app to disallow pasting of lengthy passwords. detail: the ipad app will not allow users to paste in a password at the login screen that is in excess of 31 characters. passwords of 32 characters or more are, in fact, allowed at the quickbooks online site. it seems insecure for intuit to be promoting a culture of using short, non unique passwords for login to something like quickbooks that holds the keys to the castle for all of it's customer's financial institutions. please urge intuit to fix this issue and allow the same length passwords at the qb online site as on the ipad. thank you --steve little little stair and building company
long way to go. this app has long way to go, if you truly wants people to work from every where, then make this app work just like web logins works. on apple ipad pro 11 inch, even i login via chrome, use request desktop version option enabled, screen flow do not work properly, its a mess, firefox is up to date, but says update firefox, safari has the same problem not showing screen properly. screen responses are some times too slow, to the point you cannot work from it. app has problems of its own, even though its showing at the time of login that fetching data, but still old data, i have to force refresh it after screen is loaded. direct debut functionality do not work in app, cannot select while creating a new invoice. i will make a change to invoice, save it & when i come back to it, changes will not be saved, its totally unreliable. tested xero app on ipad pro, works like a charm, qb sort it or loose us.
"expense management isn't there yet. the app is so close, but 2 stars because this is a major hassle. expenses that you input and assign to a customer are not marked as billable and there's no way to make them as billable. they're always input as nonbillable. for me, all of the expenses i assign to customers should be billable, so i have to manually go through them at the end of the month in the desktop version to fix this (which means i sometimes miss them). just having a ""billable"" field on the mobile that carries over to the desktop would solve all of this. alternatively, adding the billable field to the main expense view on the desktop, or a report that showed billable vs nonbillable expenses would also fix this."
needs some improvements. great app only thing that would make it better is an offline version for the ipad
no too bad. this app for the self employed version is pretty good. using the ipad is less so, mainly because it will not rotate into landscape view and the appearance of the interface is slightly blurry / not sharp like other apple apps. the features though, on the whole are pretty good.
best accounting app. easy to understand & learn
great as an assistant to the desktop version.. i've found this app to be a great mobile partner to the full desktop (or online) version. there's a couple functions that aren't available in the app but everything you do need is easily available. i can't connect my bank account because my (non us) bank isn't listed but being able to input expenses as they happen is a great way of keeping updated accounts. reconciliation is a breeze afterwards. it's a great app.
great little app. i do emergency call outs and can log in and keep up with my book keeping on the fly.
iphone app switching companies. thank you so much for adding the ability to switch companies without logging out!! more likely to utilize iphone app now on the go 😊😊😊
touch id doesn't work. other than that this is a great app. it is easy to use except that i have to type my password every time i open the app. i love the automatic receipt capture from camera.
crap. this app is a piece of crap my dad got it on our computer.when u scroll it goes the opposite way and there is also a bunch of other crap. i would. it recommend getting this
quickbooks app is a perfect companion to quickbooks online. quickbooks app is a perfect companion to quickbooks online. it works seamlessly allowing you to read through your transactions and even create most of the common tasks. ( with the exception of vat tasks) qb online is the perfect accounts program
overall pretty good. overall i'm pretty satisfied with the app. my one major complaint though is that it doesn't support third party keyboards. so when writing invoices or estimates on my phone i can't use my swipe keyboard which i've gotten very use to using as my primary way of typing. it is to allow third party keyboards, but then they took it away. it would be nice to see this return.
best app for accounting. i used another app before but quickly switched to quickbooks. it is by far the best out there in the market in terms of features and ease of use. i am not an accounting expert but now i can quickly generate my financial statements and get funded. thanks a lot!
great app. quickbooks have a fantastic app with full functionality of the browser version.
what a nasty app!. was forced to start a trial just to open the app. once registered and everything, i realised i don't like the app and wanted to cancel my trial as it said 'you can cancel anytime'. and that's when hell started. it's impossible to find info on how to cancel. had to log into the desktop version on my phone and in order to go that you wait for a code sent to your email which never arrived. tried again the following morning and once i was finally in my account, the site was so poorly built that it kept redirecting me to other pages and not the help page where i was hoping to find out how to cancel. finally had to log in from my laptop (after waiting for a new verification code) to find out you just let the trial run out. what a massive waste of time. highway robbery. disgusting!
worst user experience, terrible app and product. i’ve spent the last four hours attempting to use what should be easily configurable software, or at least is billed that, and this is absolute rubbish. there’s no way to modify a beginning balance contrary to what the “help” says, there’s no way to separate expense categories beyond the few default ones, and i am shocked that software that is this widely used is such a terrible user experience. both the web access and the ipad app are kludgy. don’t do it.
"great app. excellent app that integrates with lots of other apps i use. it has saved me many hours doing my accounts. (game changer for sure!) - i just wish i could change the wording ""shipping address"" to ""property address"" but maybe in time"
frustrating!. this app and the full cloud service is very frustrating. i am an accountant and i’m beginning to look for alternatives for my clients because qbo, app and full cloud, crashes repeatedly. my clients experience countless hours of downtime throughout the day. also it makes no sense that qb self employed has the ability to track mileage but the more expensive versions such as essentials and plus, do not have that ability. i have clients who are self employed but they need essential or plus version of qbo and they are not able to track their mileage. instead, they have to use a third party app. it would be nice to be able to setup other accounting capabilities such as tracking loans and investments. come on quickbooks! this level of service is unacceptable.
great app. only thing missing is the ability to track billable time with clients
need it but disappointed. i need this app and use it almost daily for our small business but i've been very disappointed every time you do an update. so many glitches every time making it hard to trust that new invoices were created, payments actually were taken, or emails sent. the last 2 updates were especially frustrating. smaller font on invoice numbers and buttons for taking action (such as taking payment, sending emails, print options) are a real annoyance. if these kinds of things could be fixed i would change my review to 5 stars.
lacks important functionality. this app doesn’t let you see current bank balances for any account, which is a major oversight. intuit: please add this feature.
very convenient and usable. great app that connects me too my work platform everywhere i go!!
love it!!!. app is easy to use and saves me so time! wish i did it a long time ago!
sales tax calculation is wrong. when creating an invoice, the app does not honor customer's sales tax setting. it applies tax even on customers with tax turned off. please fix asap!!!!
good. good apps
missing key functions. whilst i understand this is a mobile app, even the qbo version lags behind in key functions from its desktop predecessors, all of which intuit has had ample time to upgrade to fully integrated functionality. intuit needs to put full functionality above the profit margin and put customers above dollars.
ok but frustrating. doesn't do as much as online version. lots of error messages when downloading bank data. poor customer service, not responsive when errors flagged.
new update fail to open. just updated and app will not open
what a joke. downloaded this app so i could pay employees and taxes on time without having to be at my computer and i can't do either, i have to be in front of my computer to do both. i don't understand why it's not allowed on mobile app.
owner. great app
great app!. this app has saved me tons of time and i love it!
disappointed. this app falls short. for one you can't see inventory. can't create p/o. can't enter a bill against a p/o. on the online version one cannot enter a partial bill against a p/o. cannot creat inventory level alarms. come on man!
3 stars. doesn't do everything i would like it to do but overall pleased with this app.
small biz owner. i can't function without this app. perfect for the owner on wheels and phones constantly.
left hand doesn't know the right. when i switch from logging in online to the ipad or iphone, the app doesn't seem to be updated with the new information. case in point, my credit card was hacked so i had to update my account info on all my subscriptions that used that number. i received a notice form qb that my account was suspended. apparently it isn't possible to update the subscription info from the app, so i did it online. now when i open the app it still says my account is suspended. one of many glitches that exist between the app and the online experience. needs to be streamlined! also requires too many clicks to achieve objectives. frequently crashes when trying to import a customer.
generally impressed. great utilization of ios. i am generally happy with its performance. there are three reasons i won't be using it yet: 1. the lack of accounting (bank accounts & chart of accounts) options on ipad app 2. the lack of form customization (invoices and estimates) 3. the lack of memorized transactions numbers 2 & 3 also apply to the difference between qb desktop and qb online. if i switched to qb online i would be using the ios apps almost exclusively. i can't make the switch until these problems are addressed. i sure hope they are fixed soon!
game changer. i love the seamless transition this app allows me to have between physically being present in my office working or out of my office. every entry is reliable and super quick. easy to navigate through billing, issuing po's and even receiving payments with scanned documents attached all from my phone!! love it. syncing issues? nope never!!!! if i could only generate reports within the app so communicating figures while on the go could be seamless too. until then 4 stars is where it's at!
great app for business. love this app. great for my work as i'm mobile 90% of the time. certain features that i can't access on the app easily than on the desktop.
love it. this is a great app to keep your accounts up to date on the fly.
great app but still buggy. this is a great app and has lots of functionality which is awesome. i can see my day to day company accounting actually being easy using this however i can’t actually accept bank transactions to reconcile an expense for example. big shame as it’s a great thing to do when stuck somewhere with just my phone and the functionality is clearly there, it just doesn’t work for me for some reason. it works fine in my browser and support have been great in assuring me that it’s being looked at but it’s making me think twice about committing to quickbooks after my trial ends. fingers crossed for an app update soon to fix it. *update* this issue has been resolved with the latest version and the support team were really good throughout. extra star because of this! thanks developers.
no access to payroll. the app seems to have a menu for everything except payroll. i find these types of oversights all over quickbooks online- glaringly obvious features that are incomprehensibly missing and customer service has no answers. don't waste your time.
great app... works amazingly well.
great app. i use this everyday! wouldn't want any other invoicing company
needing improvements after more than a year. the app is good for entering transactions and it does this poorly. you have to perform searches which are cumbersome. despite the fact on mobile i have entered transactions for only five vendors, it shows a list of the vendors with whom have transacted business with the most for the last 15 years. this app only does a fraction of what the full online app can do.

awesome!. great job! better late then never! we are an ipad company and we have to keep a bunch of pcs around just to enter our qb data. now we can finally ditch a couple of the pcs. looking forward to more updates on this app! us small business owners need full functionality plus more from our qb app. the features i would like to see on future updates: - customer can sign invoice in the field - can print invoices and reports via airprint - access to our balance sheet - custom date options on p&l and other reports - build in payroll into this one app
cis unfriendly. useless if your a contractor or subcontractor. if your in the construction industry, this app is useless. you cannot create cis invoices which renders this app useless.
great accounting app. i've been using the quickbooks app for a over a year now and i love how it allows me to stay on top of my business accounting. i love that the app allows me to take a snapshot of my receipts and link them to their corresponding expense transactions within quickbooks.
oakes firewood llc. great app! love it! easy and fast to use. good job!
easy to use. this app is so quick and easy. my business is on the go all of the time and it makes estimates and invoicing so quick and easy.
even worse after last update. didn't think the time loading could get any worse. i was wrong. ap is pretty much useless while with a customer. everything takes forever to load. need to sign in every. single. time. then you click out of the ap and right back in and it makes you use the touch id. super sucky. i very much dislike, yet i need to use it everyday. ugggggggg.
not like the online version. the app is alright. missing a lot of feature (if you compare it to the online version) but if they come up with a solution and have them on the app version i would rate it 5 stars.
no security with ios 13.0 update.. nice to have the app working again .. too bad it opens without the required password. shoddy update.
best app for invoicing. hands down the best invoicing app i have found, it was recommended by another business owner and i am very pleased with the purchase.
not just yet..... still have to enter my password every time i open the app. touch id or app pin don't work. ipad and iphone data isn't identical. this is so annoying.... especially in front of customers!! tired of wasting my time. update: deleted the app and reinstalled it to see if that made a difference. touch id works for now. will update after some use. bumped from 2stars to 3stars. update same day: already back to manually enter in in password. 2 stars.
terrible customer service. my subscription got canceled unbeknownst to me due to a payment problem, updated my info and it just shows as “-$1” in my bank account and still says i need to update my subscription?! to top it off it kept saying there was an issue with my billing information and when i checked my account it showed several charges where i tried to resubmit the information when it said it wasn’t going through. i called the number provided, and it is one of the most frustrating processes i’ve had to endure. finally got to a human being and was told i had to be transferred and was on hold for an hour before i finally hung up! now i’m waiting and have had to do several jobs without quickbooks, extremely frustrating!!! will probably be looking into a new accounting/ invoicing program soon if this isn’t resolved.
great app. the most recent updates made this app amazing. it is invaluable in my business. there are still some tweaks to be made but overall i give it 5-stars.
"there photo above shows signature capture, it does not have it. no signature capture update : response to developer 8-5-17 puzzled ? as am i 🙄 i called in 4 times about this ability to capture signatures first time i called the customer service person tells me, no we dont have that no you cant. then i asked why is it your help center data base clearly stating plain as day instructions on how to. 1. create new invoice 2. enter all needed information 3. click on the capture signature. also not to mention the fact the screen shot here in apple app store for quickbooks clearly shows a signature being captured. so after lots of back and forth tells me this is a new and quickbooks company doesn't tell them (customer service) what quickbooks os doing. what!? got off the phone didn't want to waste anymore of my time. round 2 call customer service tells me that its not capable of capture signatures, then after guided her to your help center where it clearly states how to puts me on hold then comes back and says that its new and there and there implementing it in in phases !? and my account number is part of phase 3 and would add the capture signature button in 3 weeks. ugh ok i guess i can understand that. round 3 called in again she also tells me no its not possible explained my last call with customer service and stated i was checking on the the update phase. after explaining the last call i had to this customer service rep. she was more bewildered than prob you are right now reading and she to was left puzzled as was i. then proceeded to put me on hold to research. comes back tells me yes you can but only if you have a merchant services account through you. hmm thats odd i thought. she tells me that the signature capture is for payment credit card. so i proceeded to explaining a plain signature capture by a customer on an invoice. she proceeded to tell me no unless you have a merchant account. ok fine over, but before i got off i guided her to the help area in quickbooks if you search how to capture signature. it clearly says so and what she told me didn't match with what was posted on the help area. which is capture signature---available on invoices and estimates. now if your estimate is being signed i didn't know you had to have a merchant account and i didn't know thats industries standard to run a credit card transaction off of an estimate. in the end puzzled as you are and pretty much moving on to another service unless you can find someone that knows what exactly is going on over there at quickbooks. that i will end up speaking too someone that knows what there doing and what there talking about, i will not call and waste more of my time . and by the way your web browser version of quickbooks online on a mobile device does not load correctly the right side is cut off making the invoices or anything you do on there useless im on an ipad 12"" pro. doesn't matter what browser you use same prob, try using the app instead but cant as it lacks all the features the browser version does. so any way you cut it. no signature capture something so simple to do. please let me know what you think of all that, im trying to be helpful here as i expect better from quickbooks your industry see your help instructions below capture signatures using quickbooks online for mobile open a new or existing estimate or invoice. add any transaction info, as usual. select get signature. let your customer sign with their finger. they can always clear it and sign again. select done (android) or save (iphone/ipad). you'll see the signature on the estimate or invoice. it's that easy! update: 7-27-17 there is no signature capture on invoices even though they tell you there is there is not. it only applies through tak ing payment by credit card transaction through quickbooks. something that is so basic to business the leading book keeping company can not provide. walk into customers store drop product they sign the invoice received! thats it! nope not quickbooks so pass them up. plus thats not counting time hours and hours of lousy customer service and back and forth till they finally fessed up to it. don't waste your time."
what a life saver. i needed something to simplify the data input that comes with invoicing and dealing with the piles of receipts with the flexibility of not having to open up my laptop to do so every time. when i saw a promotion to try out quickbooks online with ability to have access on mobile devices i figured i'd give it a try. it's been a life saver. my account transferred seamlessly and quickly. it eliminated having to manually enter my credit card purchases and bank account transactions because you can link those accounts right to quickbooks and they update automatically. i can take pictures of receipts right from my phone or ipad and take care of them immediately as well as emailing invoices or recording payments received right from my phone or ipad. it's great having this ability on the go. so far i've discovered that i do have to log onto the website directly to get more detailed/specific reports, but it's possible i just haven't learned how to do it yet via the app. thanks for simplifying my life in this aspect anyway. hoping it makes tax season a little easier.
easy to use. generally easy to use. some limitations on app.
awesome app!!. seamless and intuitive. can accomplish so much with this app. thank you!!
better than others. but for an intuit product and compared to the desktop version, it sure doesn't do all it should. it's pretty basic and does pretty much what i need as a small business owner. it took quite a while to figure out the quirks and logistics of the app, i'm still annoyed with the lack of certain features after a year of use. like why i can't print directly from my ipad/iphone which is what i mainly use. and i don't like the form layouts. but, it does sync well with the web/ipad/iphone and does a reasonable job of keeping things organized, which is very important and the problem i had with the previous app we tried.
taking our business to a new level. we have been so happy since we switched to quickbooks online plus! it has allowed us to streamline our invoicing and bookkeeping. our clients love how easy it is to pay invoices online. we love knowing we've received payment for each cleaning performed! qb customer service is excellent.
"not seamless, very frustrating. why isn't ""transactions"" listed as a choice in the left menu bar?! i wish the choices in that list were the same as they are on the web version of quickbooks online, making it a truly seamless solution. i also can't edit a transaction in the app once it's been saved, or make it a split transaction. so i have to go to web version anyway. this makes the app useless much of the time. it's incredibly frustrating, and if my accountant didn't ask that i work in quickbooks, i would abandon it in an instant."
simplifies. this app makes it really easy and fast to manage receipts and expenses.
time saver. i highly recommend this app, specially for small business. quick, easy and in combination with service m8 it's all i need.
keeping my desktop version. update: 7/12/2017: app doesn't let you customize your invoice settings. the app is limited so you have to use the online version at times. once you subscription is over the app makes it hard to renew. ive tried it for 6 months and its been real difficult to run a business with limited features. i have used quickbooks since 2001. so i love quickbooks. save a lot of time on accounting side of the business. when i was making the move from a windows based laptop to apple (ipad) for my mobile business, i found this app to be very low on features. simple tasks like sorting a list, inventory, and reports were poor and lacking. the online monthly subscription is a joke. you have to opt for a more expensive subscription to gain features that still pale to the desktop version. long term, it's cheaper to buy the real program. plus all your personal financial and customers info won't be out in the web as much. the web version of this app does not inner exact well with a ios web browser. that being said, i bought a windows based tablet and install my desktop quickbooks. i have no monthly fee and i have all my info not floating around on the web.
priced higher than the performance. this app does a lot of things well. however, basic things like connecting accounts are a nightmare of inconsistency. i've spent the better part of an hour simply trying to connect checking accounts that are all at one bank in to my app. it worked one time and let me connect one of my six accounts on that connection but wouldn't let me do the others. after that it wont connect using the same established connection. so many cryptic errors or connection issues, so many verifications of the stupid i am not a robot despite that i already did touch id and text verification and user name and password to get in. every single time they error out, i have to redo the captcha bit with the pictures. which are the worst. i know that once it is set up it is an ok experience, but the setup is a nightmare that is representative of a free product not one that costs me a monthly subscription.
great app. i’ve been a subscriber for about 3 years it’s a great app ... for me the one thing lacking is being able to enter and track progress payments.
i spoke, they listnened. i have had my fair share of frustrations with intuit and when they send out questionnaires i answer them and my biggest complaint was no access to a p&l which is now apart of the app. it's perfect for what i use it for and there's nothing like creating invoices and getting paid on the go. great update and thanks for listening.
good app.. it works good with my ipad mini.
great until update. all good until the update. now inputting new customers or suppliers is very slow (that's probably an understatement). hopefully going to rectify this as i'm still paying every month.
love this app and it's capabilities. the only feature i wish it had is to be able to see bills from suppliers.
great app. love it! easier than the desktop version!
app barely compatible with computer. the the features on the app and computer barely cross over and i can never find customers on the app that i have on my computer so i have to jump back and forth to make things work.
ipad app keeps me up to date. i appreciate very much how handy the ipad app is for quickbooks online. it continues to add new & helpful features. the one i’m most happy about lately is being able to successfully “match” downloaded bank transactions. this keeps me connected to my actual cash flow without needing to have a bulkier electronic device with me. i travel a lot and being able to work with the qb online app is key to keeping my business successful.
needs work. glitches, freezes all the time, constant updates asks me to review app while i'm using app so annoying
love it. i love this app, just doing what i want
"best idea yet!. run a one-man business on this app, it's the best idea. once in a while, life has its financial surprises, and would be nice if there's an option that you could pay your dues without having to call, especially on weekends when no ones there to answer so the business doesn't stop or on a stand still. and would also be great if intuit would allow an online payment for our customers that can be tag onto our own websites...that would be a nice touch, one option monthly billing! another thing, it would be nice if intuit/qb would integrate the ""sales-forms"" invoice payment and receipt sales as one to show customers that they did paid up! hey, do it qb, it's for the best! still, awesome job! love the app so far!"
new app is great!. the new app is super user friendly and versatile. it’s easier to use quickbooks from my phone than it is from my pc now. vast improvement over the previous versions.
can't live without it. the app is super handy for viewing business info on the go. i'd love it more if there were a few more reports.
no access to payroll. the app seems to have a menu for everything except payroll. i find these types of oversights all over quickbooks online- glaringly obvious features that are incomprehensibly missing and customer service has no answers. don't waste your time.
worst customer service. i have had quickbooks for over 6 months and have had to call customer service probably 10 times. i have never spoken to someone who knew what they were doing and have always been on the phone for 40 minutes minimum while the operator reads through the instruction manual and tries to solve the issue. the clearly have no training on the software and have no issue wasting your time. wish i could go back in time and choose another service that actually cares about small businesses.
my experience. quickbooks is a system designed for people in business to streamline there activities. in doing so allowing their accounting processes to flow more effectively. quickbooks has changed my business dramatically. thank you
there photo above shows signature capture, it does not have it. no signature capture update: 7-27-17 there is no signature capture on invoices even though they tell you there is there is not. it only applies through tak ing payment by credit card transaction through quickbooks. something that is so basic to business the leading book keeping company can not provide. walk into customers store drop product they sign the invoice received! thats it! nope not quickbooks so pass them up. plus thats not counting time hours and hours of lousy customer service and back and forth till they finally fessed up to it. don't waste your time.
questionable developers and qa. don’t bother with this app. more time updating this weekly with version changes and bug fixes... jokers edit; 29th nov 2019 - this continues - just look at the version history log on the app...
desktop should be same as app. great app but a shame that the desktop version dies not have the same functionality
love quickbooks app!!!. great app. allows me to conduct business while on the road when computer access it not possible.
how do i remove this app from my iphone?. i do not want to use thus app and now i cannot uninstall it from my iphone. l try by holding the icon and get a message asking if i want to share it. does not show in my settings so i cannot delete it there either. can't find online help.
business owner. this is the best app on the market!!!
best app. i wish, i was aware of this an year ago. nevertheless, loving this ....
"fees on fees. while the app itself works and is fairly handy, i strongly advise against quickbooks as a company. i signed on as a business owner for $6.95 a month and was immediately slapped with over $100 in fees hidden in ""fine print"". worse is the utter inability to get any customer support from intuit. i canceled my subscription and despite already paying for the month, lost access immediately and lost all of my records. then i got billed again. stay away."
useless app. mileage tracking is grossly inaccurate, way too many inadequacies and limitations on the invoicing and accounting features. this app is a joke. i tried it for several months and have lost money as a result of it's shortcomings. the positive reviews here must be fake. do your research and search the web for accurate reviews. i recommend everlance as a better option.
app is handy, but buggy. recurring invoices are a wreck. i have had the same issue for 2 years with quickbooks resetting my settings every month and automatically sending invoices to my clients without approval.
very nice!. i love have this power in my phone! i can email invoices or print them out, all on my phone! this app is easy to learn and soooooo fast when you get used to it. there was a lot of thinking when they designed this app, wow
waste of space. all we want to do is access quick books online via our ipads. this app is worthless. as my business continues to grow we will obviously be looking for a software provider that listens to clients instead of putting out disappointments like this. save the space on your ipad and don't bother.
crash issues. this app crashes on the new iphone 11 pro max using ios 13. please release updates to resolve the issue.
i am truly loving this app. been hunting for a simple app for managing the finances of my farm business. this helps me with capturing and analysis of all my expenses and income. the reporting is also amazing. i also love the fact that i can even get more stats and reports via the web. amazing stuff. already introduced it to quite a number of industry colleagues. truly an amazing app
great app!. only change would be to allow for a larger job location field. other than that i can honestly say it's helped us tremendously with invoicing.
awesome. this app is great and very robust
research before you buy. program works ok but has a high learning curve. also apps have restrictions on what you can do. cannot post new checks in apps. cannot log onto the website from a mobile device. reports are limited. i do not do invoicing and use it mostly for my accountant, and i'm still learning so the final jury is still out but from what i've seen so far i can't give it a higher rating.
too many glitches. i love quickbooks and i love that they have an app but there are a lot of glitches in the performance. the screen goes blurry, logs you completely out of the system inconveniently, customer list is unlined with the screen, there are more but minor.
new business. great app, easy to use when building my own business.
business. i'm very happy with this app help me a lot
fantastic software !. this has made my life a whole lot easier. invoice and estimates on the go. i really feel in control of my accounts.
quickbooks online is lacking in a number of areas. first of all the payroll service and the support that comes with the payroll service is substandard based on my experience. the support staff is not very helpful. also the software used to be better, but it stopped doing all the forms as of recently and you have to manually do some of the forms. intuit once an innovator of financial software has been lacking in recent years on a number of their products, they just don't seem to care about customer service and the quality of their software's as they used to. at some point, i am probably going to switch to xero as i find both the customer service and the progression of the software not to par and even amateurish in many aspects.
expected better.. for quickbooks having been the leader for so long in small business accounting software, i expected more from their online format and their app. while it is great for quick, on the go stuff, you can't add accounts in the app. you have to log into the web version for that. overall, i expected more and felt i stepped backwards in using online from the desktop platform i had used for years.
keeps crashing in iso 13, can’t even start up. didn’t they have enough time to test before the final release of ios13? minor issues are one thing but the app doesn’t even start, that’s a sev1 that should have been caught long time ago.
so far so good.... the app does what i need it to do mostly. one of the coolest things is being able to photograph my biz receipts into the app, and throw away the original. i'm not crazy about the app in terms of creating invoices that do not match what my desktop version looks like. hopefully the fix for that comes soon. 4 stars from our end.
terrible support. after a couple of years of bombarding to upgrade to online i gave in. no one explains how many features are locked down in the online version, until you migrate and start to use as a long time desktop user. the product itself has a lot cleaner interface. but the support for a business product is terrible. the people you speak to don't know the product, and have no means to escalate a knowledgeable person, any attempt to get a close out to a problem is impossible, they won't commit to when an issue will be fixed and once they escalate, you are in the dark. i want to manage my business, but since migrating to this product i feel i spend more time talking to intuit than my customers. if someone would sit on a call and commit to close my issues, i would rate it highly as a product. but as a technical guy, clearing the browser cache is not the answer to every issue. if your business relies on this product, i would seriously consider not bothering. i'm sure if missed our subscription then there would be some attention from the account team. if you want to leap in the dark, then my advice is don't migrate your qb data and start afresh.
not reliable. app logged you out while you’re still driving or doesn’t log you when you need it to. this used to be a great app but then this glitch happen with it not logging in and logging you out when you don’t want it to and when you contact customer service there’s no help other than delete the app and re-download it re-login yeah that doesn’t work.
can’t subscribe after trial period. it’s a good quickbooks version but i started trial period made a profile and invoices but the app won’t let me renew subscription the buy now button doesn’t work when clicked on. now i may have to start another profile and lose everything?
ipad perfect until ios 8.5. app hasn't worked since 8.5 update. have sent several request about the app crashing and no one has gotten back to me. i've deleted and redone loaded, rebooted ipad, etc. when not crashing it's a 5 star app. please fix asap!
doesn't work. app doesn't sync all data with quickbooks online. i see only my company name and customer list. no invoices, expenses etc. intuit support we're not able to help.
quickbooks online for the ipad. it works great!! anywhere at anytime. create your customers, create the estimate and then bill it out!! if your smart you will setup the direct payment to your bank account too!!
thumbs up for the business help!!!. take the time to go through the orioles and this is an amazing app to help with any small business!!!
good app it works. happy enough. do miss the previous button on items like supplier bills and customer invoices. app is also improving. thanks qbs
average at best - limited functionality. this app is not a first release but still lacks many features needed to make it worthwhile. the app doesn't offer full functionality and will let you do thing like create and send invoices but won't let you run your business from the road or while on vacation. the bank feeds you set up in the desktop cloud interface are not viewable and you can not categorise transactions. this is offered in the usa version though. the invoices look sharp on screen on the app but when you send them they revert to the ugly templates intuit provide. also if you run a business with multiple brands / sub brands or trading names you can only use the parent company business name and logo. massive flaw if you sell over different channels. intuit have a good base here but the development is incredibly slow. look back at the forums and see that feature requests have been asked for over 12 months and not been developed even though they are basic things that xero offer. worthwhile having the app, but don't be fooled thinking you can use it for running your business books.
"useless. i use quickbooks online extensively at my corporate office. this app, and what is available through the ""mobile"" website version of qb online, is useless for getting any work done outside of the office."
beware: app & the company. i was recommended to get the quickbooks app for a client who turned out to be a scammer. i sent the scammer an invoice and sent a trusted client an invoice the same day. quickbooks quickly red flagged the scammers payment and requested that i verify my trusted client. there is no customer service for this app, email assistance only. when i finally got through to someone who could help me they assured me that my clients funds would be sent to my bank account. that was november 9. my client contacted her credit card company and was told that the quickbooks had already received her funds and because i had rendered the service would not refund her account. now i am told that i must wait until august 15, 2019 to receive the funds that my client paid me for my services rendered. this is a scam! i think that quickbooks is sending this scam out beware!
poor functionality. constant crashes inability to complete selected tasks poor functionality this app try’s hard but doesn’t quiet make it with its functions. it didn’t at all shot me but that’s what the 3 day free trial is for. i wasn’t going to rate this app but after they charged me $10.50 for a 1 month subscription after i cancelled and deleted the app; i will rate it
daily user of this app. getting better and better keep up the development i appreciate it.
very intuitive. incredible app. i find it easier to use than the desk top version.
could be better. this online app could be a lot better. limited in what it can do, but not bad for the cost
desktop user tries online quickbooks. don’t do it. i repeat, if you are used to the desktop version, there is nothing but pain and frustration in your future. and, when you decide you do not like the online version, be prepared to loose all of your estimates (10 years for me) and have your books be off by ridiculous amounts (about a third of my gross receipts for 10 years is missing from my banking account). who knows what errors i have not found yet. i was lured in because of some problems i have been having with 2015 qb and have wanted a more mobile friendly version of qb since i started with them in 2008. i have wasted countless hours trying to make this work and final ended up buying a windows tablet pc (mac user, so that was painful) to get the mobility i need, assuming i can ever reconcile my books again. the one star is for the online techs. they are the all-stars of the quickbooks techs with the patience of job. which is good because they will need it and you will need them.
solid app with pros and cons. let me start by writing that i'm a finance major by education and i've been a qb desktop user for well over a decade, so i'd consider myself a qb expert user. then i was exposed to qb online (the plus version) through some work i do with a non-profit. if you're coming to qb online, from qb desktop, there's going to be a bit of a culture shock. i say that because, as an advanced user i find that the online version is lacking a number of features that i am used to in the desktop version. also, there are a number of hidden features that are not available to general users, but you really won't know that until you call tech-support... which is, i have to admit, really quite good. because you're dealing with a remote database you're going to find that there is a lag time as qb writes and retrieves data. this becomes a painful realization if you are entering a large number of transactions, or trying to clean up someone else's nightmare idea of bookkeeping. as a sidenote, i read in another review that someone complained about data not being in sync across multiple platforms. i found this as well on a couple of occasions, however, in my situation this was resolved by closing the app and reopening it. i have also had to reboot the app (on every platform) for various other reasons, a remedy that is more than slightly annoying when i am trying to get large quantities of work done. all of these ills, in my opinion, are attributable to the fact that you're dealing with the remote database, and something gets hung up in communication. those criticisms aside, qb online does have a lot of great things going for it. it's extremely portable, and does have many of the rudimentary features found in qb desktop. i've been able to look at financial data, send invoices, make vendor payments, as well a whole host of other tasks right from my ipad. overall i have to give qb online a thumbs up. yes there's still work to be done, but it's a solid app, and intuit is moving in the right direction with this product.
owner. don't do it! the customer service is horrendous. i have spent hours and hours on the phone with their people. they canceled my subscription when i went to fix something i can head no customer service. when i got the subscription issue corrected and then renewed my subscription they charged me twice for it, after that was corrected they canceled my subscription again. so when i needed customer service after that i could not get any customer service. both of those times good cook it shut me down for a day each. a little while ago i got there update for their online version. tonight i printed 50 invoices fold them and they do not lineup with my windowed envelopes. so i called customer service to get that taken care of. their suggestion was go by different envelopes. maybe i should buy a different software
no offline mode. the main reason that this app will not work for me in every case is that you have to sign in every time and that means having good cell signal. i was frustrated recently when i was doing service work for a customer and i had no cell service at their house. i needed to access previous records and because i couldn't open the app without signing in and that requires internet, the whole situation left me quite embarrassed and feeling very unprofessional. maybe i should just use my phones native note taking apps to keep records that way and then just use quickbooks on my desk top only. what's the point of a mobile app when you cannot access it. not everyone has ideal soul service 24 hours a day. i have other apps that i use for different various reasons and it has a sync feature. this allows you to access the app, enter information, access information and it will sync up when you get into cell service or wi-fi later on. i thought this would be the standard. if you're worried about security just have an app that has a lock code on it. so i would like to ask the developers to create the app that has the same feature like the majority of the other apps have, sync with an optional lock code, no internet required.
still needs some changes. multiple addresses for a company is still a drama as it changes all pervious invoices and quotes. plus now on the ipad version it says i can't access until subscription is paid but it is.. works on computer but can't use my ipad. annoying!!!
crashed when entered a sales transaction. downloaded this app to see if i could use it instead of at a computer and the app crashed as soon as i tried to enter a sales transaction. i tried to enter in the receipt type and it crashed
down hill. the app use to be great and every time i launch it it would use finger print to open, but now it is asking for a password every time i shut it down. it only asks for the finger print if the app stays running in the background.
great updates and really user friendly. all works better than before and integrates brilliantly. makes understanding our financials a doddle!
subpressions. like the mobile app
"best idea yet!. run a one-man business on this app, it's the best idea. once in a while, life has its financial surprises, and would be nice if there's an option that you could pay your dues without having to call, especially on weekends when no ones there to answer so the business doesn't stop or on a stand still. and would also be great if intuit would allow an online payment for our customers that can be tag onto our own websites...that would be a nice touch, one option monthly billing! another thing, it would be nice if intuit/qb would integrate the ""sales-forms"" invoice payment and receipt sales as one to show customers that they did paid up! hey, do it qb, it's for the best! still, awesome job! love the app so far!"
great app. a lot of functionality from the site packed into the app. easy to use.
simple and easy. great for keeping tabs on your business on the go but would love to have the actual versus budget comparison on the dashboard instead of having to bring up a report.
"don't download latest version!!. software was great before the latest update. now, no more touchid support, no ability to email invoices. we all remember what apple did with the maps mess, i wonder if intuit will have the testicular fortitude to ""can"" the person who attempted to update the already good software?"
good app with a few issues. easy to use. easy to enter receipt into it. switching between companies is s pain you must log in and out to do that. overall a useful tool.
latest version is a disaster. face recognition does not work at all. you have to sign in every time you open the app and often get kicked out especially when switching between companies. colossal waste of time.
life is easier. this app has made invoicing for my business easier and more mobile. i no longer have to be in the office to create estimates, invoices, receive payments, etc... perfect for my marketing business!
great app a must for business. i have waited to switch to qb online as i had read a lot of negative feedback but this is a great app for keeping in touch with the finances of you business and easy for those not trained as an accountant
quickbooks app. i like the app except i can’t seem to add accounts to the chart of accounts.
intuit. great app will be nice when we can scan bar codes on receipts
great app but .... i use this app frequently while i’m not at my computer but am disappointed that i can’t access my suppliers & update supplier bills etc, will you be able to add this feature?
jireh landscaping. great!! great program and app!!
very user easy. this app is great. very user friendly!
couldn't do without it. the qb on line version has really simplified our operations. the ability to have multiple users from different locations, especially remote access, has made life easier. either using a laptop or my ipad is great when out of the office. the only thing i've found that the app does not allow me to do is prepare a purchase order. but, there seem to be periodic updates so hopefully this will be coming soon. i would recommend qb to any small business.
"confusing and cluttered app. i love that nearly all of the features in the desktop app are here in the mobile app. however the interface, especially the home page, is confusing and cluttered. ""company activity"" is a bit useless as the default page. show me the charts of paid/unpaid invoices. i think the developers are tasked with including every single feature and that clouds their design judgement. it's not an easy ask but let's make this app more mobile friendly."
app needs major work. the app is useless, i have to pull out my laptop or wait till i get to my home or office. i would love to use my ipad pro, that i carry everywhere but the app is literally useless!!! please fix asap
junk update = worthless app. since the latest update, my qb app shows an error saying that my session has expired immediately after i log in. i can't use it at all. pc access is okay.
chrashing in estimates. the app is great, only hiccup is that it restarts as soon as i go into opening a new estimate
makes life easier!. helps me keep record of everything from invoices, payments customers and expenses. all from my phone
great app. i haven't subscribe fully but am definitely paying for this...
great but needs some updates. just recently i am unable to log in to my company. i can get on to my online account, but not on the app?? says my email and password isn’t found?
turnover. i just really want to know how much i’ve turned over this month. can’t see how to get this easily in this app. in the desktop version it is on the desktop. can’t find anything about this
"amazing for my business. i wouldn't know where i would be running my own business without this app. it truly gives an ""on the go"" experience and aided with other tools i can work anywhere in the world. thanks quickbooks!!"
google sign-in never works. i have tried and tried to get into the quickbooks app using the google sign-in. i get it to work maybe 1 out of every 50 times i try to login. i don't know why they haven't fixed this issue yet. i always end up logging in on my mobile browser instead. fail
great tool for any business owner.. qb online is a great resource for any business owner and any individual that wants to get away from the paper-and-pencil ways of managing their finances. it allows for quick invoicing, keeps client/vendor information handy and auto-populates their info on forms, allows you to run tons of reports and is fully customizable to suit my business needs. all of my products and services are ready in drop down menus so i just tap a few buttons while i'm out in the field and i can send receipts, invoices, anything. it's smart and can connect to all of my accounts and imports that info to a digital check register. when my cpa need info, i can email it straight from the app or, if you're lazy like me, just give them the login info and they have access to whatever they need. i've been told that qb can also be automated to send out docs on its own, after the right set up, but i have yet to get to that level.
qbo. pretty great app, i hope they add some additional features; like printing a pick list, and a few other things.
great & smooth accounting app. very good up to keep on top of your finances . it's the best on the market.
i like it. best app for your small business
great accounting apps. great apps..
don't update the app!. i updated the app this morning and similar to other reviews, i can't use touch id. i have to enter in password every time. i'm unable to save a payment to an invoice also. hoping this gets resolved soon. previous version was flawless.
quickbooks app. i find this app to be the most useful app on my phone to run my yard care business due to be able to add jobs that have been done right on my phone to make it easier to remember what's been done
excellent program & service. as a small business owner we never have enough time. qb makes account quick and is very easy to understand. $15/ month (which is a tax write off) is a great deal. think about what you'd have to pay a cpa to complete all of this paperwork. my accountant can easily sign in at the end of the year and get the necessary information. the customer service line is more than helpful. i've thought about going to qb training classes but there is no need to pay someone else to teach you about qb. with their helpful videos and attentive agents i've been able to learn and understand the program quickly. i've gotten 2 other business owners to use qb and will keep spreading the word!
great app unless you have employees you want to use it. (even after the recent update that seemed to target the below issues, non of them were resolved). the app works great if you're an administrator but if you have employees you've set up as users who you want to empower to add expenses directly into quickbooks (for example), which is a super basic feature that is 100% described as possible by intuit, you're out of luck. they are unable to see accounts when they go to attribute an expense to a particular account (or a class for the matter) and the app doesn't let them add an expense without attributing it to an account. and then, even though you wouldn't want employees to do this, if the employee tries to add a new account in the app in order to add the expense, whyte told they don't have permissions to do so. it's a bug for sure but a very big one that 100% cripples the app for those users. i can't believe this hasn't been addressed yet by a company and an app as big and established as quickbooks. please fix this asap!!!! ** i appreciate the reply to my review but two updates later and one of which supposedly targeted this issue and yet the issue persists!
quick books app. have been using quick books app for my business for a few months now, and i am very impressed with the package, as it's great value for money. i enjoy being able to use the app on my phone as it offer all the services that i need to be able to quickly raise and send invoices and pull up important info.
missing too much functionality. basic features like looking at an account are missing. my chart of accounts are listed but clicking to view transactions says this account not viewable in the mobile app.
excellent. i love the immediate accessibility of our business's financial position. no need for me to meet with the bookkeeper and accountant nearly as often. i haven't had any issues with the app.
don't believe the hype. this app is practically worthless. all important actions require you to be on the website. i need to be able to invoice, payroll, and do taxes from the app as i am hardly with my computer.
great app. let's me keep up with things while i am on the go.
good accounting software. i've experimented with xero,reckon,myob and various accounting apps but this is best of the lot. it connects to your bank account transactions and as you enter your expenses it automatically matches them making bank reconciliation a breeze. once you set up your customer list it's so easy to select one and see what they owe you and also to look at costs for that customers job. the supplier list is good and you can see where your at with a particular supplier at anytime. customer service is fast and you get very detailed answers to any query. the only thing i would like to see is more customised invoicing. i like how you can add as many receipts photos and notes to each customer happy with the program so far.
seems great so far. this is what i've been waiting for so i can invoice my jobs right on the spot. a few months on and yup this app is amazing works perfectly for what i need.
quickbooks online for the ipad. it works great!! anywhere at anytime. create your customers, create the estimate and then bill it out!! if your smart you will setup the direct payment to your bank account too!!
good online bookkeeping application. i am an international tax accountant but i use qb online for my personal expenses as well as for a small swimsuit company that belongs to my fiancé. the linking system with qb and bank/credit card accounts is quite impressive. app could be confusing to some who do not have previous experience but it is somewhat simple to learn. the only thing i would like to be able to do on qb online is enter transactions into an account as i would be able to in qb desktop version. entering expenses (not using the bank account linking) can be very tedious using qb online.
awful. iphone app pretty much unusable in the real world. always wants to be signed in each time you open it, touch id feature doesn't work. today it's complaining the app needs to be updated before i use it, it then directs me to the app store where it shows i already have the latest version!
no ability. i download the app and signed up, then i realized that i have to be self employed
intuit is too big to care about quality.. hi intuit, you are a multi million dollar company. why is it that importing a contact from my ipad customer list into an invoice cannot pull the address with it? this is just one of many clunky problems that companies with much less resource would identify and solve. you think you are so large and we need you so much that putting out an app like this will go up noticed. i have been using qb online since it began. your first ipad app was laughable and this one just makes me angry i have held onto my subscrition for so long. now that there are competitors it's going to take more than lowering your rate to $19/mo to keep this customer. it's insulting.
complicated interface, terrible customer service. i am not an accountant by any means, but i was hoping quickbooks online would be easier to use for us average joes. nothing about their program is intuitive- you are instead given loads of video tutorials and when that’s not enough you can call their sales department to get transferred to customer service (don’t try direct, it’s no use) who 9/10 times have thick foreign accents (which makes it even harder to understand the foreign accounting software) and if you’re lucky you get scripted answers with a side of sass. in my opinion, if your programming isn’t overwhelmingly user friendly you should at least have an overwhelmingly good customer service experience to give us all hope that we can, one day, figure it out. i am stuck with this program because my husband finds it easy enough to create and send an invoice, but unfortunately this leaves me to figure out the rest once a month. so all in all, thanks to quickbooks online our customers do know how much they owe us but as for the accounting, nobody knows what’s going on there.
not that good, just ok.. the app doesn't do everything. so i go to the webpage. when i do, there's all these dumb invitations and prompts to use the app, which doesn't do what i need it which is why i am there in the first place. marketers, true to their nature, are ahead of the tech department. i can't see the whole screen on some of the webpages. unless i go to a computer, which defeats the purpose of qb on-the-go, i don't know what is in the corners of the screen. the bill to and ship to shown on invoices and estimates is mega-aggravating. it ends up the in right spot sometimes, at best. how can i present myself professionally when qb is making unfixable typos on my behalf? if you enter a customer, then change what you entered at a later date, it's like a baby bird has imprinted on the wrong mom and it can't be changed. again, professionalism is at risk. baby bird follows you around indefinitely. however, qb does lots of things well. it is probably the best out there, which reveals a kinda pathetic marketplace for this stuff. good luck with qb!
so much that's so wrong. this rating is for qbo overall, because the app lives in an infrastructure. qbo is rapidly becoming the biggest pos in the accounting world. not sure what they’re trying to do, but it isn’t producing a usable set of books. the app is just a small part of the collapse.
hot garbage. latest update to this piece of garbage app requires you to log in every single time. pathetic these guys can’t get it right. update 02-02-19; still has constant logout problems after all these years. would give 0 stars if i could.
could be better. still no auto save. it’s 2018 folks, time to wake up. does not perform the same on my phone/tablet as my desktop. i.e automated emails on my desktop autofill my clients name, my phone does not. on my desktop i can switch the order of items on my invoices and estimates, on my phone i cannot. the simple editing features are extremely important on a device that smaller than my hand.
good but frustrating.. no access to vendor information or purchase orders on an iphone or ipad. have complained about this for nearly 2 years. falling on deaf ears. they agree that it would make sense but there is no one that gives a *%!£ to do anything. 3/13/2017 have now a problem accessing qb online since yesterday. download company on either the iphone or ipad takes an hour or more and on certain devices never will. customer service doesn't have a clue what is happening. we have all gone multiple resets and all other aspects of the devices operate correctly. extremely upsetting on an extremely busy monday. 4/4/2017 we are still stuck with no access to our invoicing. we were told that a review was coming out today. customer service is usless!!! we are looking for an option to change to at this point. 7/27/2016. they have been making periodic changes that for the most part just cause us to get use to small changes that don't relate at all to the items we have been concerned about for over a year.
perfect app. perfect app
general consensus. customer support for mobile app is horrible. the mobile app really needs some help. they should travel along with mobile users to see issues and frustrations that arise in the field. i am a professional but at times this app makes me look very unprofessional. the should work on offline features.
awesome app. it's a womderful app, so versatile and functional
great app. great app!
works great. good app. works great on the road for creating fast invoices on site. great companion app for quick books am dos fully functional.
app shortcomings. if you are a business owner or manager and having ready access to view/pay taxes and entering a bill is important to you, this app is worthless as you can’t do that. i was hoping to ditch my laptop for travel and just take my ipad pro with keyboard, but, this is not viable, at least for me. and if you think you can bypass the app for these things and open up qbo via web browser and work with that, fuggedaboudit, doesn’t render or work properly.
"not as good as it was.. getting worse. incorrect allocation of funds to invoices. the mobile app doesn't allow expense entering anymore (""we're working on it"" - november 16). yes, you can see invoices and forward from the phone, but wouldn't want to do anything else. come on qb, get your act together. u.k."
great app. works well for small to medium size businesses on the go!
excellent. for someone who hates keeping receipts. this system is perfect, i simply photography my receipts, lose them as usual and still get to claim my expenses. no more awful receipts for me!!
missing deductions!!. the main reason i’d want to use the app is unfortunately not available in france- photographing any expense receipts i have and immediately entering in deductions when i make purchases. until this part of the app isn’t migrated over to the french version, the app is almost totally worthless to me. so bummed. however 3 stars because the app runs smoothly in what it does, even if you can really only enter sales and receive payments.
not bad. app is good. qb online is lacking.
very easy and convenient!. i love having the mobile app. it makes it easy to enter transactions on the spot without having to stop and open up my computer to login.
perfect. works great for my contracting business. i mainly use it for estimates and invoices.
"hilfreiche ergänzung. obwohl die app nur auf englisch vorliegt und damit die bedienung manchmal ""erraten"" werden muss, ist sie eine gute ergänzung zur pc-anwendung quickbooks online. es gibt zwar einige einschränkungen insbesondere bei den einstellungen, die teilweise nur am pc geändert werden können, aber für auswertungen oder schnelle eingaben unterwegs durchaus nützlich."
crash instantly on iphone 5. this app crashes instantly and doesn't operate on my iphone 5 running the latest iphone software. i tried removing and reinstalling but it still doesn't work. why don't you guys fix this?
excellent app. easy to use. makes record keeping on the go a snap.
lame first attempt - try again please. this app leaves so much to be desired. i would expect maybe 50-80% of the functionality of the online version of quickbooks. but, this only provides a few very basic things. and, things that are already handled by the iphone version of the app. it seems like whoever is designing these apps doesn't actually use quickbooks and doesn't understand what is really needed. using quickbooks for ipad, i should be able to: run reports (as i do online), create invoices from employee time, enter time, match downloaded transactions. this app just doesn't make sense. who cares about a list of activities, i want to see my information organized the way it is online.
missing key functions. unless i am daft and can't see it, there is no option to add a bill. i just want to add a bill from a supplier to the company. adding an expense won't cut it, because some of the bills are not due upon receipt. i don't see the chart of accounts. i don't see the ability to pull up the supplier history to pay the bill or simply check up on the account. if these functions are available, they are not easily found, therefore making this app not very user friendly these are not super advanced needs. these are pretty basic functions that are not available on this app.
finally!. ah, finally...an app worth paying for. i've been shopping around for ages trying to find a business program that suited me...there were lots suited to photographers, but the interface was kinda annoying. quick books is great...it's simple to use, it's an app not web-browser based and the design layout is pretty nice! something that's missing, is i can't add my banking details or a paypal link for different ways a client can pay me...which is a little annoying....and i'd love if we could make prettier invoices, but i guess not necessary...just my creative side wanting a bit of flair. overall, great so far!
a great improvement over the mac desktop version. it saves me tons of time that i used to spend recording payments, expenses and running reports. client payments are easily paid via credit card by the client and automatically applied to the invoice. it has simplified my accounting.
very good and getting better!. qbo has been a great addition to our company and has many great features over qb desktop. there are some bugs to work out but i'm very happy so far with the online application.
awesome. it's taken me a couple of weeks to figure everything out but wow this a well thought out software and app!
awesome app. as a small business owner i'm constantly on the go. this app is amazing. with very little effort i can quickly add a new client create an invoice and get paid how i want.
couldn't do it without this app. love this app. sooooo mobile friendly!
works for me!. i love this this quickbooks app can cross platforms. every entry is accounted for in a matter which device i use (and i have a ton). as with anything, there are glitches but they do not stop production. like everything can't be perfect all the time and with the constant improvement, bugs are expected here and there.
session expired loop. every time i log in i get a session expired message and logs me out. app is not usable.
app keeps crashing. please fix your app... i pay a lot of money a month for your service and this app is terrible. for the most part i have to log into the online service to do any work. please fix your app
amazing app!!!. this is the most powerful and helpful app to manage a company, it it easy and friendly!!
what a life saver. i needed something to simplify the data input that comes with invoicing and dealing with the piles of receipts with the flexibility of not having to open up my laptop to do so every time. when i saw a promotion to try out quickbooks online with ability to have access on mobile devices i figured i'd give it a try. it's been a life saver. my account transferred seamlessly and quickly. it eliminated having to manually enter my credit card purchases and bank account transactions because you can link those accounts right to quickbooks and they update automatically. i can take pictures of receipts right from my phone or ipad and take care of them immediately as well as emailing invoices or recording payments received right from my phone or ipad. it's great having this ability on the go. so far i've discovered that i do have to log onto the website directly to get more detailed/specific reports, but it's possible i just haven't learned how to do it yet via the app. thanks for simplifying my life in this aspect anyway. hoping it makes tax season a little easier.
good start. this app is a long way off from being useful in the field. don't get me wrong, the pie charts and colorful graphs look really cool and may even convey a lot of info quickly, but as far as practical use this app needs work. i'm sure in a few months as features come online this app will be great in the field. but until then stick with intuit's quickbooks mobile app, (designed for iphone) they've finally got that one to the point where it actually works and saves time. it works on the ipad too.
excellent app. keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
ios 13 crash. an awful app that is made even less useful in ios13 because it just crashes straight after running.
update needed. for the past three weeks has not been tracking the miles. otherwise a 5 star app when working properly.
nonexistent customer service. i have had some very poor experiences with quickbooks desktop versions. the product itself is generally fairly good but customer service is ridiculous. so when i was looking for a accounting program to use on the smart phones, i was reluctant to go with quickbooks after using three different companies and having a good experience with fresh-books. in the end i only went with quickbooks because the they were the only ones who had a canadian payroll system available. so far a horrible mistake. i signed on with my credit card to turn my trial basis into a regular subscription, complete with printed receipt. now it is still not giving me what i paid for and warning me that my trial period is about to end. that in itself is annoying, but trying to actually contact a real person in their customer service is virtually impossible. in comparison to when they were trying to get me to sign on and were phoning me personally. so my recommendation is to go with anybody but quickbooks. oh, and if there's an actual person who works for quickbooks, my invoice number is b1–7383544. in case you actually want to fix this disaster.
quickbooks = easy bookkeepping. love the mobile app, very easy to use. access accounts from anywhere, raise invoices, pay invoices. simplified bookkeeping!!
poor customer support. in general the service is good unless you need help ,almost no response from customer service , payroll service is poor .no follow up ,nothing invoice on ipad doesn't accept the customer signature anymore on ios 9 ,no update to be found either no phone number ,end of year will be a good time to switch provider
super & excellent apps. very user friendly application . i would recommend this software to other people
please add a vital function. need to add bills but can't. how ridiculous to not have this function. adding bank deposits etc. surely it's time to add this to the app. for me it's unusable
"quickbooks on-line has many software issues. as a decade long quickbooks user. we upgraded to the quickbooks + nearly as soon as it was released. this option allowed for mobile device support. worked great. then with a 30day noticed we were switched to qbo and this app. this is where our love affaire with quickbooks ended. the program has give us hundreds of hours of lost productivity, spent on the phone following red dot with tech support only to be told ""this issue needs to be upgraded to programming"" or something of the sort. system will go offline making all your information unavailable during the day. new and constant programming issues with nearly every update. issues have cost us thousands with our cpa trying to resolve issues caused by qbo. btw- our cpa firm says the same, qbo is a problem for many of their clients, resulting in a lot more billing hours for them. bank account suddenly stop syncing, sometimes for days or weeks at a time. credit cards will process, but not register to banking at time, throwing off banking balances. extremely limited on invoice or estimate layouts and designs. in ability to customize fields. first time we tried to print a check register in reverse order, program reversed the order on who the checks where written to, but not the amounts, so nothing corresponded. another programming issue. for over a decade we encouraged fellow businesses to use quickbooks. with qbo, we highly discourage this unless you prefer spending hundreds of hours trying to correct qbo related and caused issues."
great app. this is getting better with each update it makes. i you this app everyday to run my practice and it makes it very convenient because i'm constantly on the road and i don't have to sit at my desk just to enter expenses or send invoices to clients.
another update, still a poor application!. once again, with excitement i upgrade only to be letdown. when will intuit make a full function app? i love the message that tells me the function isn't't available for my device but i can access it from my p/c...great, i'm still tied to my desk! why bother with the mobile app then?? still, does not use all the functions of my iphone. i love how i can only rate this useless app once in the lifetime of having it,i would give it no stars if i could!
qb app is useless. update quickbooks refuses to recognize they have a problem with data being displayed incorrectly on the ipad app. it simply doesn’t show all of the current expenses like the online version does. i deleted the app and reinstalled same problem, so please quickbooks support listen to us and fix the problem. i’ve been quickbooks user for a long time and discovered this app gives a totally different set of numbers than quickbooks online does. expenses are different than real version so please beware, you can’t trust the numbers. contacted support to no avail. i guess they don’t read the other reviews either. received a response from developer tried all their suggestions results the same. my mobile app doesn’t display an accurate picture of expenses. many others have noted the same thing. the solution isn’t to delete and reinstall the app. that’s not a solution that’s a work around.
major issues not getting fixed!. in ios quickbooks application logs out every time it is closed. often cycles through the 2step verification process until restarted again. quickbooks engineers are aware of the issue, no resolution date. sure makes thinks look unprofessional when i’m trying to make up an invoice in front of my customer and my software won’t work. just turned a 3 minute process into a 30. now i loose billable hours as well. thanks quickbooks!! i pay a lot of money for such crummy service and support
great program. i love quickbooks. i run payroll and create estimates, invoices and sales receipts. i am able to link all my accounts even my square account easily and seamlessly. the customer service representatives are competent and friendly.
great app. just started my own business and having quick books is a lifesaver. easily customized and user friendly. the app saves time since i can maintain my books on the go and my cpa sees the same thing instantly. great app for a service business
only good thing is the price. it is a good value for the price, unfortunately that is about the only good thing about it. they need to set up some way to let you pay for the app from your company checking account instead of having to go thru an app store. they need to make the print function available on anything you are looking at. the need auto-fill on email addresses. this app could be so much better but they rarely upgrade it because they are the only game in town. i would switch to another companies app in a heartbeat if one ever becomes available.
horrible photo receipt capture function. the recent update apparently changed the algorithm for identifying receipt paper boundary in a photo that makes no sense at all. two out of three times it only capture a useless fragment of the whole receipt which the makes entering receipts a horrible and utterly frustrating experience.
amazing app. wouldn’t be able to run my business without quickbooks. thank you for the prompt ios 13 update!
must have for small business. i love the app is easy to use and easy to monitor business finances
crashes every time. when app is installed i can log in to my account. then the app says « downloading data » and when download is complete it crashes. if i open it again (so still logged in), i cant even get past the launch screen.
this stinks!. what is the point of a mobile qb app if you have to pay $20/month to receive payment when you already pay for this feature online! big ripoff! you shouldn't have to pay twice for the same feature!!
good deal. i appreciate this app. it helps me keep an eye on my business so i'm not always sitting in front of my laptop.
worked great until the latest update. i've really enjoyed having access to invoicing and to see how everything is doing right on my phone as i'm out about about taking care of business needs throughout the day. as of the last update, however, i seem to have lost the ability to see or send any new invoices or add customers. along with that, as of the update it is no longer allowing me to log in with touch id or pin, instead asking for a password every time. i loved the app until this latest update.
poor service, poor quality product. this product is the worst i have had to deal with. service is non existent, the app is constantly in errors, backing up is slow, the system does manual and not by the operator, everytime the + symbol is used it closes the app. my accountant doesn’t even like the system. i have loaded, unloaded and reloaded the app so many times it’s no longer a joke. quick books tells me they fixed the fault, like never.
managing partner at green mesa capital, llc. a very useful app. i can do everything i want through this app. in addition, the app has features the browser does not have, like the expense receipt capture.
easy enough to use, works best with the online version. i'm only using this for the basics of bookkeeping, so it's enough for me. the functions in the app is different than the online version, so i mainly use it to take pictures of invoices. i enter an invoice online, then snap a picture of the invoice using the app. i also use the app to quickly get a monthly total per supplier, which the online version doesn't have. april 2017: loving the new update, now there's a way to attach multiple notes/pictures to an expense, so i don't have to go back to the desktop app for that to work, thx!!
"alternately great and lousy.. they have now added an additional layer of security that makes it very difficult to use this as a mobile app. it has cost me money twice. the story i get from support is that it was a decision made in the ""board room"" and their is no work around. every time you use this app from a new location you are required to enter a six digit code that is emailed to you. their system is s l o w generating emails. if you are wanting to use this app in the field it's difficult. i am looking for new software. marketing with postcards by date is still very difficult. it's a problem i was promised a fix for over 10 years ago. the app updates every time you open it, so your computer thinks it is a new program. the suddenly and without warning added a new level of security to the on-line and windows app versions that that requires an email verification. i had a task that should have taken 60 seconds and after 10 minutes trying to fix it myself and another 45 on the phone with tech support, i was invited to call back in the morning. i am looking for another program. recently they have taken to making unnecessary changes without warning."
splendid. excellent to have such an app to complete all needs and it's on mobile too
life is easier. this app has made invoicing for my business easier and more mobile. i no longer have to be in the office to create estimates, invoices, receive payments, etc... perfect for my marketing business!
simple, yet capable. does everything i need and i love being able to use it online, iphone and ipad. on the go flexibility is a must and this app does that flawlessly!
not bad, but needs improvement. this app is good but needs improvement. improvements are mostly needed with the bank connections. i have to constantly tell my clients to update their login information in quickbooks for their bank accounts. this makes it's frustrating and time consuming for me and my clients. the app should also make it easier to do the same things as the web version.
time saver & ease of access. if you don't have the app for your small business account already, well you better just click download now! it saves me hours of computer time each week and my clients get the necessary paperwork even when i'm on a job site working. invoicing and inputting receipts has never been easier!
"not worth money and it's free!. when it works it's ok at best but it's too flawed to take seriously. among its faults: failing to find entries on search even when the search term is correct. doing things like stating the ""delivery server is down"" when trying to email an invoice. the ""delivery server"" is not down as the user finds out when they continue to send other invoices. upon investigation of the fault it issues brainless messages such as ""you (name) and you (same name) we're working on the document at the same time and you (name) finished before you (same name) did. you get the point! app search not formatted with an ipad so the ipad user cannot see all of the information being searched for (when search works at all) seems to randomly wish to send verification text codes even though it claims that it should only happen once. updates do not address the faults just add a fluffy new feature. seems the app was slung together and no one researches how it might be used. in use there are constant error messages (like for every step) saying you don't have permission to add s part and then it lets you do it. imagine going to your customer for a signature and they see these messages. app is constantly updated giving the user features they don't need but they never update to fix the bugs!"
shiny useless tool. this app looks awesome. very well thought out design and it appears that most of the functions are right at my fingertips. not so. i have used it mostly for categorizing expenses. i was trying to run a report, but nothing really made sense. i went first to google to look for some tutorial videos, but it appears that most of the videos available online are only advertisements. that is when i went to the help and support section in app. in the section there is a faqs area. perfect! when i read the only article in this section i thought it must be some kind of joke. it was an article on how to get to the faqs section on the app. it is like some perverted groundhog day scene, or like when you are reviewing a resume for a potential new hire and one of the sections is the filler text from the template they created the resume from. i expect more from this company. fix this or simply remove it.
does not show suppliers. since update app does not show suppliers or let you add expense, which makes mobile app a waste of time
"not useable in multi-user environment. here we go again, another update and still no fix to locations and classes. intuit must be the worst software company on the planet. so in april intuit ""reaches out"" that a fix is on the way. that was 5 months ago! i stand behind my criticism. still a 1 star. what is wrong with intuit programmers? yup, yet again another update, and still not useable in multi-user. my business has more than 1 user account. locations and classes do not work in their accounts. how many years will this take to fix a bug that has been present since day 1? another update and i stand behind my previous review(s). seriously? another update, and still not multi-user friendly. but, oh boy, something works with apple watch. when will intuit fix the multi-user issues? someone else mentions they fix bugs. i can say the exact opposite - they leave bugs for years! i want to use and like this app. i've looked at every update since the very 1st version. it does seem to be slowly improving, but is still not useable for my company."
actually makes accounting a little bit fun. i absolutely love the way this app allows me to record, photograph and categorise expenses from receipts. so easy that it actually is fun. delighted that i can get rid of all this paper!
needs more functionality. time tracking capabilities are missing which make this unusable for me, forcing me to use the online version which defeats the purpose of this app. it doesn't really make sense to release an ios version that can only do a portion of the tasks.
great app, but!. this app has been great for my mobile business. invoices and estimates look really nice. like most mobile apps this one has many limitations. if you pay for an app you should get all the bells and whistles that you would get on a desktop or laptop computer. hence the word mobile!
subscription. cannot updat subscription gives error on can’t upload data, now expired, very frustrating need solution
please add a “transfer” option on app. overall good app but would like to have a transfer option on the mobile app- i find myself having to login to the desktop version just to transfer amounts between my accounts. also, someone please find a way to mark estimates as “read/seen” by the customer just like the invoices do. ipad version needs help; jumps around too much
"needs splitscreen support. how can this app have as many revisions that its had since ios 9 came out and still not have split view with other apps?? also the glitch is back that when you hit the ""back"" button when viewing a customer it takes you all the way to the top of your customer list instead of going back to where you were. frustrating..."
landscape company. i like this app as it helps me stay on top of the billing before i leave the site. it is quick and easy to use once set up with your desired pricing. customers are surprised at how quick the bill is in and how great the invoices look. if you are just starting or want more family time i suggest this oh and for receipts you can take pictures and save them in the phone. the only part i hate is the billing is monthly only by credit card. they need a yearly subscription. first year buy a box set as it is cheaper i am now in my second year of using this and madly in love with it.
not an intuitive product. i'm very disappointed with this product. i've used quickbooks on my laptop for two years as well as the gopayment app. this has been extremely frustrating to setup and use for both my accountant and myself.
love qbo it's fantastic.. this app rocks. i can see they are adding more features.
disappointed. after everyone raving about this app, i decided to look into it. i was offered a discounted joining fee before i had even looked at it and this was withdrawn if you did not take it there and then! having joined i thought it was okay but not for £10 a month. looking online i found a six month deal for £3 per month and it had the features i was looking for. but, having enrolled the old account had to close; not a problem only the new account does not have an app/mobile feature. the opening spec said it did! i like a product that does as it should for a good price. this is not that and is not fully transparent. shame.
great app. great app
useless. app is slow and hard to use.
great app. i've been a qb user since the early 90's. the app keeps getting better with greater functionally. i'm confident that all functions will be available on the app in future release. i use this app all day to create estimates and bill customers. it's great.
so many good things ... but. i loved that i could take a photo of my receipts and then just throw them away. i like that it was in my phone and i could easily record real time so i didn’t have to go back and think what was that for? my hope was that i could easily share this info with my book keeper who also uses quick books. so i logged in on the computer so she could download the information. unfortunately the product she uses is different and it changed my app and my account such that while the information and all the receipts are in my phone the are not on the computer and i have no easy way to print the out and the book keeper is going to update all the info by hand. five month of hand entering again every check and purpose of each purchase. i talked to customer service for a long time. his final advice was to delete the app and download it again. i had just started to feel like i was getting a understanding of how my business was was going with this little app and then poof. gone. i will down load something else.
great but.......... i want to not be bothered with pop ups asking me to rate the app. this is a tool to use for business. i don’t want ads and pop ups continually having to be closed in order to work
happy and safe. at last. an easy to use app that work well for fast quoting and invoicing while on the go. my b2b clients are very impressed on how fast my quotes/invoices come in. it's a great selling point to my business.
great app that scratch. is freezing and scratching often
outstanding. very user friendly app. like nothing you have seen in accounting. the future is here.
slowly losing my business. i'm about tired of this app not functioning properly. embarrassing to say the least when i have a customer trying to pay their bill and i can't even connect to quickbooks online server. none of your apps are working as advertised. $25/month for what again?
works great for me!. this app is very convenient and easy to use. my business is not complex so it handles all of my needs quite nicely.
billable expenses. new website and app are nice, except on ios cannot specify expense as billable....why? no clue.
best app for my business!. not a good app when it doesn't download your banking, nor did it make good invoices/estimates. i love invoicesasap, but this app needs help.
not working properly after update. i just updated the app and now every time i try to edit an invoice it forces me to refresh the invoice and i lose my changes. the pin number does't work, i added it again and made sure it is turned on, but i have to sign in with my username and password each time. it worked perfectly on the last update.
small business accounting. very helpful software for my business. has everything from accounting software to expenses, to employee payroll and deductions. has helped me become more efficient with my time. makes estimating and invoicing more streamline.
avoid merchant service. avoid at all cost the merchant services. they preapprove you and then hold on your money for a month before forcing you to refund each transaction you processed with them. i had to call 6 times 1 hour each time and it is still not fixed. they are still holding the funds and it’s been more than a full month. terrible customer service.
mobile glitches... love using quickbooks but i run my business out of town where we are not able to have wifi other than mobile hotspot. using the quickbooks mobile has been convenient but also a p.i.t.a... glitches, closes on its own, logs me out, and sometimes doesn’t save invoices/estimates. has been like this for a while and haven’t had any changes..
unreliable. downloaded this because i was looking for something a little more functional than my current invoice app. had for about a week and now the app won't even open, very disappointed because i was really starting to like the software. thankfully i was still using the free trial and hadn't purchased it for the month or year like i had planned on doing.
great tool for repetitive stuff. the app version is great for day to day functions.
working great, love dashboard. app is easy to use on the go. some things are better done on desktop but for the most part can do a invoice from phone and accept payments.
great!. this app for quick books is fantastic! works just as it's supposed to! thanks!
freelance business functions like agency. this app is brilliant. i can check the status of invoices, p&l's, reference invoices, and client trends. best business app i have on my phone!
too expensive. i do to want to pay for s subscription , i just want to buy the software
"pretty much useless. have been a qb online user for years and my account is setup for a non-profit foundation, i.e. we don't have customers, but have a lot of transactions. this app is totally focused on users who have customers, but for my use, i can't see my bank register, can't run reports, can't look back at transactions more than a year ago (essential when doing multi-year grants), can't manage payroll, pay taxes, see my to-do list, and can't reconcile. presentation and formatting is primitive (hello - 1993 called... they want their user interface back!) the help system is pretty funny. not really a true ""help"" system, but more of a faq. virtually all of the answers to the faq questions start with: ""go to your web based qb online and do the operation there."" how about some functionality and help regarding this app, not excuses for the lack of features. for anybody who plans to download this app, sign up for qb online, and plans to run their business using this app, don't even think about it. there's so much missing that you could never run your business accounting with an ipad and this app. thumbs down on this one!"
does the job, but could be more beautiful. i was disappointed to find the iphone and ipad app did not have beautiful graphics, charts and graphs in the same way the desktop browser version does. i wanted a quick, general overview of where i was at rather than a line by line detail of the most recent transactions.
take me back. new updates are awful. keeps crashing..unable to do simple functions on the go such as editing invoice, sending a statement, etc. old version was much better. change it back to how it was..not every update is a good update. especially not this one.
simply superb!. quick books app really took my accounting overview in a single glance. thanks qb team for amazing ui
having issues with iphone 11. after installing the app, and attempting to access it results in crashing.
excellent app!. anything that can please my accountant and help me stay organised gets my vote!
excellent customer service. i have been using quickbooks for a short while now but have found the app to be very user friendly and easy to use, one thing i wanted to mention was the outstanding customer service i received when i spoke to tom on the phone when setting up my account, he was very helpful and gave me faith that quickbooks is a platform that i will continue to use and feel like i have my own little team behind me helping every step of the way! thankyou so much!
app is almost useless for me.. the only reason i upgraded to quickbooks on line was so that i could do estimates and invoicing on site. this app will allow me to do an estimate but will not let me do a partial invoice. if i can’t do a partial invoice on the app it’s simply a waste of time for my small fencing business.
simply works. it does the job. would like to give 5 stars but unfortunately the app still doesn't allow me to work with multiple currencies.
great app. quickbooks online works really well, fits my needs as an independent consultant.
great app. great app for someone on the go. chris
great app. i was reluctant to make the switch to online, but now i'm glad i did! app is awesome and quick. great for small businesses.
"bad idea. i downloaded to approve parole only to find i need a second app for that. two out of three ""recognized"" transactions are inaccurate. back to my mac for qb. ugly app guys. sorry..."
knight in shining armour. i've been in business for quite literally decades now. during this time i have used accountants, advisors, both financial and investment sectors. some of these were the most amazing money saving specialists i've ever met, and some were down right ridiculous. i've seen software not fit for purpose, over complicated and i hope you see where i'm going with this. i was low and business was slow, my profit was non existent! the seeds of desperation were growing in my head and i couldn't sleep a wink! and then by lucky chance one day, i saw an ad on a tv show, an ad the like i've never seen ' experience something different' it said, 'with our new quick book software, it's quick, it's simple and confidential, and amazingly good value' and so i bought a subscription, then within the hour i was up and running and haven't looked back. it's so good that my hair is starting to grow back. this has to be the best yet, and a genuine essential app for any business large or small yet don't just take my word for it! don't delay, download the app today
don’t use this with an ipad.. bought this app and was unable to get it to work with an ipad. 4 hours on the phone with this company and still no success. they charged me and told me to get my money back through apple. there is an open known problem being worked on their end but user’s beware. you won’t find out until you’ve paid.
love it. my entire business is conducted through my iphone. thanks qb for making life so easy!!! greatest app for any small business, hands down!!!
junk. this app is an embarrassment to use. doesn't attach correct to emails, rude default email tags, and prints too light to fax. i used qb contractor for 10 years before being talked into ipad by apple as the way to go mobile. save your money do things right. this freezes up a lot too which if you have time to wait may be for you.
very good app. have a small transport business. this app is already (after only 3 weeks) showing me where i can save money. up until now we were guessing!!!! never a good way to operate a business and the data i'm seeing will certainly help me to make our next purchases required for the business. i would recommend to everyone who is in business or just to track your personal financial status. it only takes a few minutes each day at home or take it on the road with you. works great..
need app to send estimates from mobile devices. looking for way to send estimates from phone when away from office. i have been testing this qbo out for a week, this in no way replaces desktop version. currently not willing to quit the desktop version. there are a few apps out there for free that create estimates/ invoices, but don't sync with quickbooks. i had high hopes that this would be the answer, even willing to pay $20 for the app. but when i found out that i must choose between desktop and qbo, and that i have to pay a minimum of $15/ month........ i just don't do enough outside business to justify $180/ year quick books needs an app for estimates that syncs with desktop. been using desktop for about 3 years now.
quickbooks. this app is excellent and the version on my computer is even better save's me hours when quoting well worth the money.
fee increase is a bad deal. fees increased but same services rendered. otherwise it’s a decent app. i’m disappointed that they get people to invest all there invoices and history in app and program then up the fees in them nearly double. can’t trust a company that does that to ya.
lots of crashes. i am a new qbo user this year. signed up in dec 2015 and had my myob converted so my clients and suppliers would be all ready in qbo for me i have started to use the app tonight just to zero out some balances left over from myob import so it's ready to start using next week .... the new financial year have found that most times i submit data the app comes up with a note saying that it had an issue, not to worry as data is safe in the cloud and to report the error code(err 10000) using the feedback form not sure why it does this as its concerning - the data seems to save ok - i'm just messing about clearing out data right now so i'm not too concerned - but i wouldn't use it for production work if it keeps doing this i have gotten the same error a few times when just browsing the data with the app too..... will go back to using pc web browser if the crashing keeps happening
qbo for iphone is amazing!!. i give it 5 stars and i love it. i have to say i am hoping they offer the ability to generate & email purchase orders from the app - then it will be complete!
hassled. having a negative experience trying to connect bank account. tried the right credentials and still not getting anywhere. waste of time.
not very user friendly.. not very user friendly. have to open the app twice every time i use it. it says critical updates required log out and log in to refresh. every. single. time. i . open. the. app. i’ve tried deleting and reinstalling multiple times. when entering receipts it could have a search box at the top of vendor list do you don’t have to ask to search every time.
"discount. update: developer says “. when it comes to recording discounts in the mobile app, we've got you covered. if you add a discount to your invoice and then select the tax rate, quickbooks will automatically apply the sales tax after the discount. however, if you tap the discount again, there should now be a ""sales tax before discount"" box. simply check or uncheck that box to get your taxes to apply properly. “ this is not how the mobile app works. there is no option to change the order of the discount. maybe this is related to the bug in sales tax on the mobile app (as in its wrong and can’t be changed, another material problem with the app). terrible. why in the world would you apply the discount after sales tax? in the mobile app, you cannot toggle the order. ridiculous."
great app. i was only half way pleased with the app before. but with the new upgrades and changes, it is almost fully functional! it is so nice to be in a meeting with my partners or accountant or client and be able to look up data on my iphone. so worth it... i love it!!!!!!!
great app. i don't understand what some people are complaining about it. this app works great. thank you
great app. great app for small businesses
major flaw. the app ui is pretty good and i really like the interface. the problem is that a lot of my invoices are not even viewable on the app. basically anything that has a delayed charge on it won't show up so there is a major glitch there or something.
fix finally now i can get back to work.. this version fixed the errors from the last update. glad it working again. quickbooks has been good except the last update. this one fixed the issue. we us this app for our onsite business and it's great. several times i would send an invoice to the customer when i'm leaving their home and before i get to the next job it's already paid.
intuit keeps working it but stumbles on occasion. i've been a qbo user for over 4 years now and run my whole one-man business on it. each app version is a bit better than the last and they do fix bugs when notified. i continue to be happy to see intuit continue to improve the app and the web interface. the blanking of bank account data in the dashboard appears to be fixed in v5.3.
love the app. it is amazing to see how well the app learn how to categorize expense! the design and ui are also amazing!
defects still in app. app was brilliant until it started alerting that my trial expires so need to upgrade when i'm on a full package and not trial version? fix needed intiut.
great but could make better. it’s a great product but i would like to be able to view and print my quickbooks invoice through the app. not sure why i can’t do this ?
great apps. good performance
excellent app. great app
getting better all the time. still needs tweaking.. i use this app for my business every day, and the mobility is excellent. saves so much time in paperwork. i've been waiting for a couple of fixes for a long time: 1. there is no way to change whether a discount is before or after tax as in the desktop and ipad versions (it's locked to discount after tax and to change it requires logging in on another device to make the change). 2. i'd love to see a couple more report options, particularly invoices by month as on the ipad version. other than having to log in on another device for these things, it's solid and i'd encourage anyone in a similar business (service industry) to use this app.
easy to use, even for a newbie!. great app. easy to use, even for someone with little accounting knowledge.
so far so good. i've been using the app for a week and love it so far. i find it extremely easy to make invoices in the field, and also very convenient to accept payments.
awful app.. literally the worst business related app that i have to deal with. get ready to log in every six seconds and have no changes saved when you modify things. the idiotic data entry fields do not allow you to enter information half the time. if literally anyone anywhere came up with a program that would import my contacts and records from this steaming pile of junk, i would switch.
easily the worst app on ios. this is the single worst and buggiest app on the app store. it is buggy, gives random permissions errors, and generally fails to get the job done.
lacks a lot of usefulness. this app is pretty good but misses a lot of the functionality that you would hope to have. it can only run a few of the reports and can only assign some of the expenses in the banking features. the app continues to get better, just wish it made the big leap.
"missing a couple things. would be even better if the mobile app allowed you to enter the ""ship time"" and ""ship date"" and if the ""reports"" could be viewed on the app- could be more full service"
ótimo. só apresentar mais facilidades ao intel o app
inventory. i would like to see quantity of my inventory on the app. please make this happen.
great functionality for mobile versatility, could be improved. qbo has made my invoicing and receiving payments from clients, much easier. i like the mobile aspect, app has just enough functionality that makes it easy and convenient to use. as of recent though, certain data won’t sync with qbo browser version. vendors, in particular, don’t sync up. this makes it a little tedious because you cannot see all your transactions in the app, even though it’s there in browser version. customer service has been excellent every time i’ve called.
a changing life app. i’m new to the u.s and this app helps a lot to get organized. just love it.
app issue. i've been using the quickbooks app for over 6 months and it worked fine. now, for the past week the app will not let me access my company data or the data is incorrect after multiple reinstalls. this is very aggravating and qb's customer support stated it's an ios issue. please correct this issue asap. thank you
very good app- missing one feature. i've had quickbooks for 3 yrs- and love the new app- one thing missing is a milage tracker in the program- had one on the desktop version- so now i have to use a separate app to track business milage.
could use a lot of work. it would be nice if i could mark invoices as paid with credit card on my mobile device without being forced to use quickbooks merchant service. i have to make it as cash and then go back and change it on the web all the time. also, if i did use quickbooks merchant service, it would be nice if it interfaces with the actual invoice so it marked it as complete when running a cc. apparently the gopayment app and the card readers don’t interface with the app. lastly, i bought two different card readers to try out gopayment and neither of them ever work. so i just use square for my cc payments because it always works and they also seem to go to bat for me when a client tries to refute a charge. one time i paid $300 for a part that my client got for free. i literally paid out of my own pocket to fix this guys computer and not only didn’t make a dime but i paid him $300 to fix his computer because i bought the part. quickbooks is a mess.. i only use it because my accountant makes me and she thinks there is nothing better.
love it. i've used many online accounting platforms and this is far the best. the app is amazing.
can’t attach pictures to expenses any more. the latest update does not allow you to attach an existing photo (for example, a picture of a receipt) to an expense. when you select the picture, there’s no button to add it to the expense. in fact, the picture is presented with no buttons or links on the page anywhere, which leaves you stuck with no way out. the only thing to do is force quit the app. apparently this problem started with ios 13 and intuit has released app updates since then, but for some reason they refuse to acknowledge or fix this bug.
fantastic. we are a small chauffer business, since using quickbooks online we gave cut the acoustic administration down by 60%. and it can be used in the vehicle via the app. and best of all, it works.
problem fixed!. app works great!
discount. why in the world would you apply the discount after sales tax? in the mobile app, you cannot toggle the order. ridiculous.
bad update. befoe you used to record bank feed but no more! this update ruined the quickbooks app
awesome. this app is great and extremely helpful with my small business. it saves a lot of time and work. not only do i find it very resourceful but it's easy to use. customizing my invoices and estimates is probably the best part of the application aside from it allowing me to check my profit and loss. i recommend this app to any user, especially a business owner.
better than the others but still need to work. when it’s working it’s working great. i’ve tried a couple different systems and quickbooks is by far the best with invoicing and estimates and excepting payments which is why the rating goes as high as four stars but it often crashes because i think it tries to do too much. also there is no way to change when the system starts counting days past due. you can set it for net 15 net 30 or whatever but it will start counting from when you create the invoice not when you send it. for me i create an invoice on monday and continue to add through it throughout the week and i send it on friday so by that point it already says it is past due five days so i have to set it as net 15 just to not make it scream at me
excellent. best app to run your business
not ready. app keeps crashing, features aren't loading... ever. balance sheet, profit loss... they error every time. hasn't worked once. app is not ready for release.
awesome app. i really like this app, i can track all my incomes and expenses, it shows my net profit and everything else i could possibly need. i really enjoy using this app.
great app would be useful to do bills on it though. reminder email doesn't work on app
so so.. while intuit has made many improvements in the last few years the iphone app is virtually useless. the ipad version is a slight improvement but neither app allow access to the most commonly accessed information. oh well.
great app. great app and great accounting platform.. i switched from using invoice2go and myob on pc. it's so much easier not having to re enter invoices twice. i love the bank syncing which is accessible from the ipad app. it lets you sign invoices and estimates. it was a little leggy but now it's upgraded it downloads the data to the app so it's much faster now. quickbooks are making lots of changes and keep developing the platform for the better. it's very intuitive and a joy to use. it's obviously not as comprehensive as the full install version but it's enough for small / medium business. it has a separate add on for payroll which i have not used yet but i assume it will work well.
keep crashing. after last update keep crashing. new update came just an hour ago still same crash???!!!doesn’t launch the app. please fix asap pleasseeee
great tool. awesome app, so far so good
good, but needs to get better. quickbooks online is a welcome change from the shackles of the desktop version, but there are still key features and functionality missing (in the app as well as in the browser) to really make this useful. like.... being able to manually adjust the amount of sales tax on a general journal entry.
worst customer service. i love the idea of the app but it’s too confusing i don’t get a lot of the options and customer service i barely understood anything was no help at all. i just simply needed the app to track income/expense and personal pay.
needs improvement. i just started using this app while traveling. it doesn’t compare to the site on my pc. very unfriendly and difficult to impossible to bring up to date.much incomplete data. need to go to work on this one of its to be useful.
easy and convenient. as a first time user, both app and desk top versions of quick is easy to use. moreover, the app makes my life much easier. even when i'm out of the office, invoicing, paying, receiving, and quick views of current status can be done at the fingertips.
great. great app, great software all around for my small business!
discussed. app would not download after several tries.
incomplete. the mobile app is not very useful compared to the online version, missing so many functions! like time sheets and billing be with them!
helpful. it's a very convenient app, i use it all the time and it's been the best!
helped me simplify. i use this to send estimates that turn into invoices immediately with a few quick adjustments (my decisions - otherwise it's a simple one click). i have it automatically set to accept credit cards, bank transfers, or they can send a check. once you set it up the first time and make everything look how you like, it's automatically way easier to track everything and even send all transactions even via phone. i'm using my iphone 6s to run my whole business now.
could be better. while it's great to access your company file while mobile it lacks certain details and/ or functions that make it a complete app. the option for creating purchase orders is available but only for an expense not an inventory item. disappointed.
so much better. intuit have certainly listened to there customers and have massively improved the app with some recent updates. so much better and easier to use than before. well done intuit finally glad a huge company has finally listened to its customers
curious???. i own a paint contracting business and we work all over nj and ny. i need to be mobile with the ability to run all positions of my business to keep that professional image along with being prompt on sending estimates and invoices. qbo gives me that full range on the go!! i'm just curious why make an ipad app that seems to have limited features when you can now simply logon through safari on your ipad have full features as if in your office behind computer?? any, amazing job on qbo all together. give the iphone app full features and i'll award 5 stars ;)
not useful at all. this app was written by someone who does not understand quickbooks and its purpose. get back to basics please if this is to be used by us.
app constantly glitches and it's very slow. i've had so many issues with this app. lately it has been extremely slow, it randomly shuts down for no reason in the middle of inputting a transaction and it won't load larger invoices. i'm very disappointed as i use this on a daily basis for my business.
won't open. this app won't open. don't waste your time.
outstanding app!. owning a small business has enough headaches as it is. with quickbooks, estimating and invoicing projects and services couldn't be easier! everything is streamline! here's a look inside my day to day as a landscaper using quickbooks: initial client meeting-> estimate delivered before i leave the property.. bam! they call back that night or the next day and we have the job. after we finish the project, turn that estimate into an invoice on site.. bam! paid! $$ in the bank!
owner. i bought my basic subscription through the apple store and now i want to upgrade to essentials has anyone done or knows how to do this
instant customer service 👌. great app for small to mid size business. phenomenal integration from windows 10. so far so good. thanks.
perfect for small businesses. i run our homeowners association with a budget of less than 100k. quickbooks is the perfect app for managing the everyday finances for our small business. it literally takes less than 15 minutes every quarter to send out 24 invoices to homeowners. the previous board spent hours sending out invoices. the account also links perfectly with our bank account so reconciling all income and expenses is simple and quick. reporting meets our basic needs and allows me to share information with our board members automatically every month. the ui is very intuitive and pleasing as well. overall, the cost/benefit of the app is perfect for our needs.
i love it!. great app haven't seen anything better.
worse than useless. i downloaded this app as use quickbooks daily, the pc software is great! the apple app is such a waste of time, i can’t access any reports and the info it does show me is a waste of my time just a load of numbers that don’t mean anything. no thought has gone into this app i suspect it’s just a tick box exercise creating an app...
almost usless. the app does not show all the info like logging in from a pc. also scrolling up or down on a page is very glitchy. quickbooks has a lot of work to do on making this app useful.
bank transactions not loaded. there are several limitations with this app. but my major issue is the inability to load bank transactions. the connected bank account goes sometimes for weeks or months without the transactions transferred to qb. other times they are uploaded every couple of days. there is no option to upload the transactions manually through the app. i called customer service but no one helped. this makes the phone app pretty much useless.
permissions issues. i would rate 4 stars if the app permissions were accurate. whenever adding a note or signature to an invoice i'm informed i don't have permission to make that change, however i do have permission to make the changes and the changes are reflected in the invoice/estimate.
"terrible!. i find it incredibly infuriating that the same issues and headaches remain with this software. how has this company not been kicked to the curb by a superior competitor yet? marketing? i researched other competitors for hours! i've tried numerous other options. i hate this product and so badly hope that somebody will produce a better option. have 2+ businesses? quickbooks says, ""kiss my grits!"" quickbooks doesn't care if you are paying for multiple qbo accounts. access from their app is limited to 1 account per device. want to see your accounts on the run? buy more iphones."
brilliant app. quickbooks is an amazing app. i'm an electrician with a small business, so i need something quick and easy when i'm in the field. entering expenses and creating invoices is so easy on my tablet and/or phone saving me hours per week. great work...i'm very impressed!
crashes often. this app goes from being usable to worthless on a whim.
improvements. 1) stock quantity should be displayed in the app 2) round off amount space in invoice
excellent!!!. i just love this app. i has allow me to invoice and collect payment at the point of sale without the paper work fuzz. it has allow me to improve my cash flow while increasing my efficiency while i am in the field. my only regret, i should have implemented much sooner into my mobile service.
changed the way we do business. i love this app. we needed something that we could easily use in the field. we can create estimates, invoices, receive payments and even attach check images to those payments. our productivity has skyrocketed. quickbooks has figured out the mobile accounting software. customers for life.
great, when it works. app is great, seamless when it works. problem is, it's only about 75% of the time. lots of errors on the mobile and desktop versions. any complaints go unaddressed. if you can run your business on 75% proficiency with no accountability from quickbooks tech support, then this app is for you!!
construction co.. this program is awesome. it allows me to keep all my books squared away. balances with my credit cards and my bank account. also the customers can pay online with the invoices and receive their own paid receipt. i have a choice to allow them to pay with their bank account to the my account or, a charge card. and if i want i could add a 4% convenience fee. this program is awesome it covers everything from payroll, subcontractors, invoices, estimates, bank transfers, bank balances, you can even keep inventory and many other things on this program. that do with a business. there is no better program out there than this one
just barely ok.. app has multiple issues . with page format. browser must use google chrome to get all options . called 3 times , on phone over hour each time . weeks later still nothing fixed . app is very limited .. customer service is a joke . here i thought i was upgrading to a better software . lol i was so wrong ..
great app. only thing i don’t like is if you accidentally delete an invoice you can never get that invoice number back and it’s now been voided. that needs to be fixed so it can be adjusted or recovered. none the less it’s a great app. won’t ever connect my bank info none the less because that’s how you get audited for nothing.
app shortcomings. if you are a business owner or manager and having ready access to view/pay taxes and entering a bill is important to you, this app is worthless as you can’t do that. i was hoping to ditch my laptop for travel and just take my ipad pro with keyboard, but, this is not viable, at least for me. and if you think you can bypass the app for these things and open up qbo via web browser and work with that, fuggedaboudit, doesn’t render or work properly.
"pretty much useless. have been a qb online user for years and my account is setup for a non-profit foundation, i.e. we don't have customers, but have a lot of transactions. this app is totally focused on users who have customers, but for my use, i can't see my bank register, can't run reports, can't look back at transactions more than a year ago (essential when doing multi-year grants), can't manage payroll, pay taxes, see my to-do list, and can't reconcile. presentation and formatting is primitive (hello - 1993 called... they want their user interface back!) the help system is pretty funny. not really a true ""help"" system, but more of a faq. virtually all of the answers to the faq questions start with: ""go to your web based qb online and do the operation there."" how about some functionality and help regarding this app, not excuses for the lack of features. for anybody who plans to download this app, sign up for qb online, and plans to run their business using this app, don't even think about it. there's so much missing that you could never run your business accounting with an ipad and this app. thumbs down on this one!"
awesome app. feature rich and also user friendly
great app. first time business owner and have to say it's a great way to stay organized
left hand doesn't know the right. when i switch from logging in online to the ipad or iphone, the app doesn't seem to be updated with the new information. case in point, my credit card was hacked so i had to update my account info on all my subscriptions that used that number. i received a notice form qb that my account was suspended. apparently it isn't possible to update the subscription info from the app, so i did it online. now when i open the app it still says my account is suspended. one of many glitches that exist between the app and the online experience. needs to be streamlined! every other app just re-ran the billing info and automatically updated to the cc replacement number. all qb is able to do is create frustration and berate the customer by suspending his account. also requires too many clicks to achieve objectives. frequently crashes when trying to import a customer.
not bad. pretty nice app. went from desktop manufacturing to quickbooks online. i like having access to my books while at craft fairs and being able to use different devices. still needs some work -- it's been weeks and my gopayment account is still not linked and now find out the online doesn't accept/recognize the chip reader. square app is more robust and may use that instead. also would be helpful to have a mileage tracker.
missing the ability to record bills in app. really can't believe they missed the opportunity to take photos of invoices we receive using the ipad. apart from that it's a excellent app
"slowly getting better!. new app is working great - i can take payments from within the app now vs using the gopayment app and having to import the transaction. that saves a lot of time. touch id works! the home page is very convenient in seeing my activity and p&l's. one thing that needs fixed is the ""due on date"" for invoicing. all of my customers are cod and even though i have this option selected it still invoices out net 30 across all platforms (mac, ios and windows). would love to see the option of allowing customer to add a tip in the future, like in gopayment. feb 22, 2017 - open/paid/pending invoices aren't showing up under customers name.."
paid for my subscription twice, intuit not interested in fixing the issue.. when i first downloaded the app i was offered an introductory offer if i signed up for a subscription within 24 hours. £5.99 instead of the usual £12.99. seemed like a good deal so i signed up on my work ipad with my work apple id 10 months in to the subscription i log into the app on my phone and a screen pops up to say i no longer have a subscription. so i quickly sign up to a subscription l, the only option being a full price £12.99. a couple days later i realise i’ve accidentally signed up with my personal apple id. so i cancel that subscription and log on to the app on my work ipad to sign up again with my work apple id. only to find out that i’ve been charged twice for the same month, on two different apple ids. now i’m stuck because i’ve got a £5.99 subscription that’s not registering me as being subscribed on quickbooks. ideally i don’t want to cancel it, because i’ll have to revert to a £12.99 subscription. i’ve been unable to send any invoices for the past three weeks or log any of my receipts. i’ve tried to contact intuit. i’ve emailed them, they don’t respond. tried the live chat, doesn’t work. spoken to them on the phone. says there’s nothing they can do, i have to chase apple for a refund. i told them i could email screenshot proof of all the issues i’m having. they gave me an email address. i send an email and they don’t bother responding to me. i go to report the issue to apple and there webpage tells me to contact intuit!! terrible customer service. no interest in sorting the issue out.
great app!. so easy to use, really makes a difference to be able to invoice and do payments on the move.
great app. i love using quickbook on my phone. very easy to access and a quick way to send my clients invoice and get a signature! i'm definitely paying for this! it's the best app i could have downloaded to take care of business! 💯💯
extremely limited. no credit memos, you can't have a simple addition of how much you have to receive in open invoices at a specific date, no journal entries. i have only my ipad pro and if i try to access the web version, it's not compatible with any browser on ios. so you're stuck and you need a pc/mac only for these things. it's a terrible, terrible experience.
can’t generate po’s. 90% of my business is generating and sending po’s which you can’t do with this app for some stupid reason. i’ve been requesting the feature for years (which i shouldn’t have to request) and quickbooks has never responded.
could use improvements. really like this app! however, it won't even add my phone number or business address on my invoices, so i add it in the message section. qb creators, please test run every possible business need. i've already done business via this app, so i can't afford not to have it at full & complete capacity! please! make me love it! i want my partners to use it too!
the worst app and support ever. if i could give this minus stars i would. the app has multiple problems: duplicating downloads from my bank account giving false balances. not recognising matches. losing transactions. camera rotates image by 90 degrees making it virtually impossible to photograph receipts. slow and inadequate response from technical support. the list goes on but i’m fed up typing now. if you are considering this app my advice is: don't if i had the time to change to another accounts packages that would upload the intuit data i would. any recommendations?
essential for my small biz. very useful app. does have some annoying issues ( crashes,signs out often, etc) but overall great app.
make that 6 stars. love love love this app! makes life easier!
great app. i love working with quickbooks i can take it with me anywhere i go and makes everything with my business that much easier. i have used other apps that were good but they didn't tie everything together like quickbooks. i highly recommend it.
lacks some functionality. my biggest problem is the app does a poor job of reconciling obviously matching expenses.
awesome app, love quickbooks. use it often to add expenses and check bank data. nice feature of receipt photo, works great
tons of bugs and glitches. there are lots of glitches and lack of features in this app. the vendor transaction history is spotty, many vendors and missing history all together. profit and loss report doesn’t scroll. can’t see the true checkbook register of checks that are written out but haven’t yet cleared. it’s really not very good.
no gst only take !!!!!. why is this an option the the web based but not the app. makes the app useless!!!!!!!!!
bookkeeping on the go. i own a small tax and accounting firm and this app has done wonders for customer service! being able to give my clients real time information from anywhere at anytime is a huge plus!
not easy to use. simple tasks like entering a transaction are complex. app and online qb have a slow response when tapping things. just overall frustrating trying to switch from desktop qb to the app and online qb.
great app. an amazing application for small business owners. a personal accountant only for 700 egy a month + you learn accounting
perfect for construction guys. i'm always running from job to job and the mobility to give estimates and invoice is on the spot is priceless... plus the customizable terms for each builder/customer with the added alerts helps me stay on top of receivables
great app. very easy to use. reliable. every once in a while it has loading issues but it's rare.
love it. love the app, really intuitive!!! and great customer service!!!
not useful, unnecessary details, waste time!!. when we want to enter any items on estimate or invoice, all the items pop up... thousands.... we are trying to write to item name but name isn't pop up from list, i mean you have to write manually all the item name or you have to find on the products list and need to choice..just waste time, it should be fast, useful, easy.. like google, like i phone.. we can manage everything on the mobil device. we can't carry the laptop every time so we need to control and do everything with i pad or i phone.. not everybody but the owners want to see everything on their i pads. just give one access for him and the other users. charge whatever you want just do it what we need pls. not unnecessary details please; usually business need estimate, invoice, expenses and inventory.. if we need more we have to buy them and we have to add our app. not employees, a lots of complicated things.. pls do it special mobile app easy to use.
great app. i love this app
great app!. i have used quickbooks for years and love their software. this application takes their wonderful software to a whole new level. the mobility and ease of use are excellent! the app is well built and very easy to use. it integrates well with your main quickbooks program and syncs all your data in real time. a+++
disjointed. nearly everything i do with this app requires amending in qbo. paying an invoice always pays money in to undeposited funds instead of my business account. when adding an expense it only offers 3 payment options and doesn't pull down the options from your own account. it would be great to see these creases ironed out so that something done on the app doesn't have to be corrected online.
adequate at best. once again i have found that intuit turns out an adequate, but overpriced product. i have used qb as a desktop products for years, never totally satisfied, but not willing to endure switching to something else. on my migration from windows to mac, i learn i must shift to qb online. i select essentials as my needs are, i thought, minimal. to my surprise essentials will not allow tracking of expenses by customer, something i thought essential but not intuit. to get that i would need to upgrade to plus for another $20 a month. if you can use something do. update: the product believe it not is getting worse.
handy app.. i've struggled for a while with record keeping and this app makes it very easy to keep records and do my day to day book keeping.
keeps getting better. i've had this app since its first release. i can finally rely on the phone / ipad app without needing to boot up my computer - including accurate profit and loss accounts and easy invoicing. the new bank reconciliation for the app works perfectly and is a very welcome addition for my business. i look forward to international currencies being supported in a future release.
"very good app.. i am an electrical/mechanical contractor and i have recently switched from quickbooks desktop to qbo. mainly for the mobile ability. i do not do too much with the mobile app, but i do make an occasional invoice or receipt. it is never going to be as fast and easy as doing it on a computer, but it comes in handy. i like to look up past invoices, customer info, or my prices for various materials. the only thing i can really say that i would like to see changed, is the ability to see the vendor/supplier info under a product. i take the time to enter the ""description on purchase forms"" on the computer, but i can't see it on my phone. i have an iphone 5s and it works great. the map function transitions to the map app seamlessly. i can add photos easily into the qbo app via the ""notes"" function. all-in-all it is a good interface."
just what i needed. i run a small contractor business doing remodel work. the mobile app has been a god-send. i can track all my estimates, invoices & expenses in one place. helps me track clients that are late payers too (which sometimes happens). i like it. 100% worth the subscription
online version need improvement. the online version specially on ipad is very difficult to use. if the could make the ipad version like the desktop version gui it would help. the app is a little unstable because of the cookies and the background history that doesńt refresh the actual data timely. overall, it is a decent product they just need to make some tweaks.
beautiful app, curious about next features.. the revamped qb online is really attractive. still people coming from the classic qb are missing features. qb uses a great system to allow customers to vote for features. the success of the online version will depend on how fast qb development will be able to produce the big wishlist of new features.
predatory data collection. the app wouldn’t allow me to accept payment without my giving it geo location. why do you need it, other than to use it in ways completely unrelated to my bookkeeping? the app was already near useless. good bye qb app!
iphone x and ipad pro app crashing/no login. the app has had intermittent issues where it logs you out every once in a while causing you to close the app, re-login and you were okay for a day or so and it would do it again. now it doesn’t work at all. i cannot remote login to my qbo account from an ios device. the whole reason i went with qb online 7 years ago was to get access whenever and wherever i needed to of my business. currently running a $4m business on your app and now looking at alternatives to move the business too. this has been an issue for nine months now. get it fixed!!!!
"qbo has miles to go.... quickbooks online is so erratic, and so full of flaws. one thing works one day and then the next day wont work. consistently new types of things – supposedly to help users – pop up on the screen but just cause delays and inefficiency. i would think this was possibly related to weak internet service, but it's not because other softwares and apps are functioning as normal on the same servers. hopefully quickbooks online will someday i get all the multi tiered bugs out of it software system… i'm a very frustrated user. my wife and business partner just chimed in, ""that's two of us""."
quick books. the best app ever, easy to use, never had an issue that could not be easily resolved. i run 2 nyc businesses and mostly on the run.
experience getting worse. entering transaction requires way too many taps. it isn’t location aware to suggest transactions you just always search. recent updates have some bug that makes the app download the data file with almost every login and login often you must. usually twice a week it loses my password. i have enjoyed quickbooks online but this app experience may have me evaluating competitors in december.
great compliment to qb online. been using qb for over 10 years. recently switched to online and added this app. amazing ease of use and highly functional.
nice app... wish it did all i need it to do. i have told people, do not buy an ipad with the intention of running qbo on it, you will be surely disappointed! the app doesn’t do enough, especially in reports and you can’t run payroll... and in the browser it’s terrible.
where’s the progressive billing option?. i was having the hardest time trying to find the progressive billing option on this app, i soon realized that the app may “just not have it”. i went to the website to find the option and create a progressive invoice, then went back to the app to apply the finishing touches. i bought an 11” ipad pro to not have to use my computer anymore for things like this. so if any developer looking at this could add this very simple feature it would be very very helpful. thank you! also an undo button would be great :)!
owner, billing, etc.. i read the reviews after i started the free trial. i have to say, that so far the app is a good fit for me. most of my business is due upon services rendered. the app seems as though it will work fine for keeping track of those clients and how much they pay for my services.
nice app that works well!!. works well, well thought out and presented. helps me day to day for sure!!
super & excellent apps. very user friendly application . i would recommend this software to other people
disappointed. just updated to the latest version and this app is crashing all day i can’t even use it normally i need to log on 10 times to write one customer i can’t run my business normally like this please fix asap the app tells me you need to do critical updates. idiot i juts updated the app and now it crashes ever time i open it
great- can scan bills directly with phone. i use phone app instead of pc sometimes, as i can record bill right when i make purchase, complete with scan on receipt. awesome.
beautiful app, curious about next features.. the revamped qb online is really attractive. still people coming from the classic qb are missing features. qb uses a great system to allow customers to vote for features. the success of the online version will depend on how fast qb development will be able to produce the big wishlist of new features.
great app. so easy for me to bill from anywhere.
content. i am a young entrepreneur who has a background in mechanical engineer with a focus on manufacturing and product development. so when i decided to strike out on my own it was along these lines. i have tried several other software packages and they never seemed to fit the needs of my young dynamic company. obviously what kept me from going qb right off the bat was cost. however, the integration with numerous other platforms and companies always was appealing to me. then when my accountant made the suggestion to switch to qb she had a very good point. qb is about the only reliable and cost effective software that would handle the more complex project and multi-level customer account strategy that was necessary for me to implement. so i switched. i am happy overall. there are minor details that are infuriating, but for the broad spectrum of technicalities that i face this software blows all others out of the water. that is coming from someone who is very adept at programming in excel and could easily automate all that i need to accounting wise with time. time being the key word there... why reinvent the wheel?
nice, but naughty. i am writing this review at christmas, that explains the headline :) this app used to be awesome. now i get a lot of can not connect to data or can not refresh data even after multiple refreshes. hope they fix it
i love qb.. that is a great app for me.
no link. why is there no simple way to link it to computer to send information. who made this useless app
"alternately great and lousy.. after all this time, they still refuse to make tiny minor changes that would make this app infinitely better. i have conversed with them a number of times and gotten a number of promises and it just never happens. they have now added an additional layer of security that makes it very difficult to use this as a mobile app. it has cost me money twice. the story i get from support is that it was a decision made in the ""board room"" and their is no work around. every time you use this app from a new location you are required to enter a six digit code that is emailed to you. their system is s l o w generating emails. if you are wanting to use this app in the field it's difficult. i am looking for new software. marketing with postcards by date is still very difficult. it's a problem i was promised a fix for over 10 years ago. the app updates every time you open it, so your computer thinks it is a new program. the suddenly and without warning added a new level of security to the on-line and windows app versions that that requires an email verification. i had a task that should have taken 60 seconds and after 10 minutes trying to fix it myself and another 45 on the phone with tech support, i was invited to call back in the morning. i am looking for another program. recently they have taken to making unnecessary changes without warning."
cancelar assinatura. fiz uma pergunta sobre cancelar assinatura e responderam algo na com nada. será que vocês podem responder como cancelo a assinatura, pois não utilizarei o app? aguardo um retorno obrigado
should of bought it ages ago. such an easy to use app and system, back up support were quick precise and friendly. well done quick books
great app for small business. simple easy to set up and use on the road.
great app. been with quickbooks for two years now and still really impressed very easy to use and works across all platforms would strongly recommend
statements. wish i could send statements from the app. i do love the convenience of the app!
great app. it's quick and easy to learn. prefect for me.
absolutely inconsistent. probably the worst app i had on my phone. i have deleted it. it gives incorrect, inconsistent notifications. it’s completely useless to access certain parts of qbo. how incredibly unfortunate that intuit can’t build an app that can compare with the advances made in qbo.
great app!. great app for small medium enterprises
don’t use the pay options.. app is great but don’t use the pay option. it took a week for the money to hit my account.
update = crash. haven't been able to use app since updated. disrupting my business. will not open.
perfect. i can't speak for large business but for a small business like mine this app is almost perfect. the only thing i need added is a milage manager for vehicle use. i love it, my tax guy loves it, what else could you ask for.
mobile app yes. i love being able to use the mobile app for quickbooks. you can't do everything you can online but it's great being able to knockout some tasks on the fly and i can show results in an instant, which is a good motivator.
forget using with iphone or ipad. app is hopeless!. despite being sold this online accounts app so that i can use it with my iphone and ipad so i can cut out the amount of work i bring home it has the following issues: it does not support pinsentry for online banking. therefore it does not link with my bank. i have to borrow my daughter's old laptop. it does not pull through personalised invoices, estimates and statements on my iphone or ipad. my work either looks messy or i have to go in and edit each document separately. i am in dispute with quick books over these issues as i have been sold an accounting package and app which is not ready for sale to the public.
app will not open after update. app will not open on my iphone, making it impossible to input expenses and worse still accept payment on jobs!
great app. makes life easy. one addition will make it perfect. add journal entry to the app.
glad i made the change. we were using xero for years purposely ignoring all its flaws cause hey, anything was better than going back to myob, though after a few frustrating years of not having basic functions on the app, no call centre for support (really??) and having to frantically search through countless 3rd party apps for simple features we finally gave up and honestly not looked back. we are now paying less than half in subscription fees, have all the functions we need built in on the web and on the app, and most importantly can speak to a human if we need help with anything. we can see that these guys are serious about improving their product and that’s why we had to give them a great review! thank you intuit for reducing our admin hours, we now spend the extra time focusing on our business and ourselves. cheers
so many good things ... but. i loved that i could take a photo of my receipts and then just throw them away. i like that it was in my phone and i could easily record real time so i didn’t have to go back and think what was that for? my hope was that i could easily share this info with my book keeper who also uses quick books. so i logged in on the computer so she could download the information. unfortunately the product she uses is different and it changed my app and my account such that while the information and all the receipts are in my phone the are not on the computer and i have no easy way to print the out and the book keeper is going to update all the info by hand. five month of hand entering again every check and purpose of each purchase. i talked to customer service for a long time. his final advice was to delete the app and download it again. i had just started to feel like i was getting a understanding of how my business was was going with this little app and then poof. gone. i will down load something else.
please: give us delayed charge already!. how many times do we have to ask? for the love of gawd, why can i not add a delayed charge on the mobile app?????? this is something you actually want to do when you're at a client, not get them to sign for an invoice every time you visit them during the month.
desktop to online. i run a construction company. i am on the go constantly, i also tried staying with qb desktop as long as possible because that was my comfort zone. after 4 years of everyday desktop use i made the switch to online. a little getting use to it but once you understand its web based and the use of the apps you will love it. the construction software i use integrates with qb online so it was a no brainer once i was fully setup with it. only 4 stars because it's a little clunky, sometimes you get delays and bumps but if you use the desktop app its much better. it can only get better imo the pros far outweigh the cons. my whole team is thrilled we switched as we can all work at the same time with ease.
quick books. love this app. very easy to use!
touch id still doesn't work. they said they fixed touch id but if you do not use the app for a while it prompts you for a password every time still. app works pretty well otherwise for quick checking of accounts and expenses. actually putting expenses and/or invoices can be a little cumbersome. i'd rather use everything online.
andrew. great system and good app. i have been using it for over 2 years now. however, there are some downsides which they couldn't rectify even after reporting them a few times. maybe i expect too much, but: you cannot upload pdf and sent it by app (eg. t&c to add to the quote), emails i sent to customers supposed to by coming to my inbox as well to keep track while sending quotes directly from the software, not happening anymore.. and some small loops while sending template msgs. but honestly, the best app and system for me so far.
latest update removed every feature i used. do not update! they really need to go back to the previous version of this app. every time they make an update it seems to be useless tweaks in navigation, font size and anything else that adds no value or functionality. they really need to just work on bugs and leave the layout alone. with the latest update, they literally removed every feature i used to use- dashboard widgets, p&l, balance sheet, bank account updating-all gone. it’s now absolutely useless.
more of a headache than a help. registered online, used same login info for the app, and the app says it's a free trial. online service not communicating well with app and i was hoping to use the app most of the time. sigh.
amazing. all i can say is i used quick books desktop version older version, the online is amazing and the availability of this app and the notifications keeps me up to date on every aspect of my businesses
buggier and more expensive than ever. don’t believe the five star reviews. intuit has somehow been able to monopolize bank feeds in order to force us to use its second rate software. this app is the slowest and buggiest app on my phone, but also the most expensive. the latest bug is that you can’t change the date when you enter transactions. it only records today’s date. it’s been like this for about two months now, just as they announced big price hikes because of all the “improvements” they’ve made. these people really have a lot of nerve.
takes too long to receive money. the good: i love how easy it is to use and it fits all my business needs. the bad: it takes way too long for the money to be deposited into my bank account. most times i wait a week or more. of course i can do it quicker with paying more fees but to me that's just another way for them to take advantage of it to make more money. i already pay a monthly usage fee, and then on top of that i pay transaction fees so for anymore fees, it's ridiculous. i stopped allowing customers to pay with credit cards because it was taking so much of my money from the fees. being a very small business, i need as much of my money as possible so the fees add up quick. if there was another service out there that didn't take as much as they do, i would switch. maybe i will start a new business offering the same service with a fraction of the costs. :)
fantastic. fantastic. i'm am obsessed with this app. a must for everyone!
love it. business owner love this app
cool app. very easy to use
app has low functionality. quickbook rocks but the app has very limited functionality leaving it as something not helpful to review reports
newest update ruins app. after updating my app touch id no longer works and i can't receive payments and clear invoices anymore also it makes me sign in every time i open the app , before this update the app worked perfect and deserved a 5 star rating , you have ruined it and made it unusable , you need to fix this.
absolutely love it! best business accounting app. great mobile online app/ tool that syncs with your online quickbooks on both mac and pcs. is everything that you could ever want or need for bookkeeping, accounting, invoicing and estimates.
comprehensive app for a small business. i have excellent experience and is easy to use with all functionality that i required. have tried xero, myob as well but quickbooks stand out for me as far as feature & function and good value for money.
great way to do your books while on the go. i’ve been a qb user for 8 years now and only recently upgraded to the online version. after several months of relearning how to use qb, i’m now enjoying the flexibility of the app. what i’m using the most in the mobile app is creating customers in the field. in my business, i will do my work and create the customer while in the field, then complete the invoice when i get back to my office. being able to create customers and starting the invoice in the field is a time saver.
app notifications. app has issues which never get fixed. always receive a bug upon opening, can’t connect to bank account until refreshed, deleted invoices won’t delete, i no longer receive notifications when customers make payments. tried reinstalling, nothing works. how do i get this corrected?
great app. the only thing i would change is making the app run things like the “report” section so that i could view profit and loss in categories such as “classes” or ‘’cash/accural” and add the ability to view and record sales tax payments. other than that this app is amazing and i don’t know how i would run my business without it.
needs work. i want to be mobile but this app won't let me select different dates for items on invoices or employee hours. please make it more functional.
absolutely horrible customer service. i have called for over 6months on issues related to reconciliation of one of my accounts. hundreds of transactions are missed every month by their software and it hasn’t been pulling in correctly. after the 5th time of over an hour phone call- i decided to cancel my subscription and start over with a different accounting software. what’s the point of software if it isn’t doing the job it is supposed to? i’m back to counting receipts etc! fail quickbooks. it’s total junk. if you have it now- check your bank records in comparison, see how many transactions you’re missing. i’m probably not the only one.
missing some elements, overall good. i like this app. great to be able to give client receipt right away. wish we could do deposits and reconciliations!
great app. this app makes keeping up with everything so simple!
"a great tool for accountants. this online version for my phone & ipad has come in so handy to check client info on the go...as well as categorize waiting transactions while i am out and about. i still use the qbo version on my laptop for ""major"" work. but being able to see things while i am out of the office is super helpful!!"
great app!!. this is a fine app, help me to run my business on the go.
easy to use, no enough control. the app looks great and is easy to use. it does not however, give me basic options. one example is that i can't seem to add the cost of materials and labor for an item that i sell. only the price of the sale. i have to manually add in expenses for each item. it's tedious and doesn't give me a good reading of how my business is doing.
good but not great. it needs to have form customization like the desktop version. intuit needs to realize existing customers are switching over for its convenience too. therefore, they cannot omit features that effect the end look of invoices and estimates. especially when the customization options are so limited as to even being able include additional images.
quickbooks online is a lifesaver!. we have a small family owned and operated business. i love the simple user interface that quickbooks online uses. it's very easy to get started with and it saves us so much time. the reports are clean and well put together and it gives me so much flexibility when categorizing expenses. it also integrates perfectly with our square card reader and gives us the option to attach receipts. all around perfect bookkeeping software for people on the move!
the best. buy an ipad. shred up your paper estimates/invoicing. stop using pens. download this app. holy crap i've been in business 4 years and feel stupid after downloading this. plus u look awesome w an ipad. plus everything's stored forever.
sneaky subscription fees and invoicing not adequate. i never write reviews but this has bugged me. so i’d heard of qb once before and have seen them advertised as being useful for business owners and the self employed. i decided yesterday to download and give it ago. you’re greeted with a 30 day free trial and then once proceeding and setting up your account you are immediately pressured into buying a “40% discounted” subscription of £5.99 or face paying £9.99 per month forever. so i agreed to it assuming it would be a useful tool and that naturally like any other subscription company the charging period would begin following the 30 day free trial giving you breathing space to cancel if it wasn’t fit for purpose. well this is not the case. as soon as you commit to the subscription it begins charging you and waived and free trial period! sneaky and underhand move there. also - when actually trying the software i tried to add an invoice to my account that i had sent a client recently. it wouldn’t let me add any additional lines onto the invoice which meant i could only add one cost and notes section completely missing the point of being able to break down various different costs on the one same invoice, such as expenses/sales etc. how stupid. on top of this the advertising didn’t make it clear there are two separate apps (business and self employed) so after downloading the quickbooks app and going through the above it turns out that one is just for business use not self emp. please amend the app title in the app store. i’ve got a refund from apple for the above but this shouldn’t have to happen. please leave your underhand tactics at the door and play it fair like any other subscription service.
used for many years but. intuit is increasing the price of quickbooks by 25% the next billing period. the app doesn’t support key functions that you can access online, for example adding multiple email addresses to one invoice.
best accounting software. best investment made so far on quickbooks and the app just excels... this is really awesome :)
"add a little more. new to the app. ( 3 months ) it is a perfect fit for my little contracting business, customers seem impressed when i ""whip out"" the i pad to invoice them after a service call. especially the sign on the screen part. but on the vendor/bill side, a couple of more functions would be very helpful. mostly entering bills, in my business i have multiple trips to suppliers, so so i end up with a bunch of non mailed ""invoices"", it would be great to be able to enter them real time on the fly. right now i can only do it via web view and sign in with font that is too small for me, as is the speed via cellular data, not near as convenient....so the receipts pile up for the week and entering them becomes tedious. five stars from me if they can add the enter bills function."
love this app!!. could run our company without it!!
master electrician. this app has done everything that i have asked of it. fantastic of estimating, invoicing and receiving payments in the field while on the job site. really saves me time.
great app. easy to use for on the go business. wish it had check printing feature. please add that.
pretty complete finance from your phone. i'm not too sure about the need for a separate app for payroll, but this does work as advertised for the most part.
good app. no complains
getting frustrated. i hate that the computer version keeps crashing. the app is nice but doesn't have all the features of the web version (or if they are there i haven't found them yet!)
expected better.. for quickbooks having been the leader for so long in small business accounting software, i expected more from their online format and their app. while it is great for quick, on the go stuff, you can't add accounts in the app. you have to log into the web version for that. overall, i expected more and felt i stepped backwards in using online from the desktop platform i had used for years.
upholstery shop. very good app
please add more search options. this is a great app to accompany a great service. my only request is that i be able to search for content within invoices themselves. for faster lookup!
great app!. an awesome compliment to the web version. addition of balance sheet would be beneficial. cheers!
"don't like it. this software is clunky and difficult to use. the page that opens first on the app makes little sense. the terminology used in expenses does not apply in australia and i have no idea what some of it means. the invoicing section is awkward to use. i tried another type of this software called ""self employed"" (another app by the same company) which seems better and easier to use but it also uses non australian compliant wordings. i found a reason not to use that either. why do they have two apps which are basically the same but slightly different? hence more confusion. it would be better to streamline both and turn it into one app as both are meant for a self employed person anyway. why does one have an auto logbook but the other one doesn't?"
love it!. i love quickbooks online and i love this app!
please add photo ability. please add the ability to upload photos to products and services! you have no idea how much that would simplify my life for me. please! other than that big issue (for me) i'm pretty happy with the way the app works - does all i need it to, except above mentioned issue.
great app really does work for my business. really easy to do my accounts and invoices.
service after the sale is nonexistant!. i’ve been trying to get incorrect billing corrected for almost a month now. customer service directs me to my sales rep and the sales rep no longer responds to emails from me or his coworkers in customer service. try waveapps...it seems to be comparable to the simple start plan and it’s free!
great app. i run my one person business on quikbooks and i am not a detail person. my clients comment all the time on the ease of payment!! love it love it
just need it to be reliable, that’s it. simply just opening the app and signing in is more trouble than needed in some days. qb has everything i need already. i’d rather have bank connections, signing in, viewing basic info, and all the basics work flawlessly than anything else.
great program. i am a startup welding company, so computers are not my strong suit. literally self taught with qb’s help section, and a couple video tutorials. i mange my companies financials, expenses and payables on my own. this is a big feat being a neanderthal who sticks metal together.
awesome app. quick books is really an awesome app. links up to accounts quickbooks payments. i can access from all my devices. it’s really versatile. you can make great estimates as well. emailed invoices and estimates look very professional.
where’s my po’s.... vendor access is very limited.. need to be able to access full vendor info and functions. app falls short on the vendor side.
app won't open after latest update! please fix asap!. app won't open after latest update! please fix asap!
touchid times out. unfortunately the touchid authentication doesn't work as you'd expect. the app constantly asks for you to enter a password even with it enabled.
good for invoices. the mobile app doesn’t have all options from the desktop app. and it’s something that makes sense... i mostly use the mobile app to check on invoices status. also the alerts ... it sent notification when an invoice is paid, and some basic information as well.
easy to use. a very easy to use software that is cloud based with a great phone app. i’ve been using this for some time now and it evolves every year. most for the best. a helpful help call centre should you have any problems. 4 stars as i don't believe you can back this up
bug fixed. your problem with app
epic receipt capture fail. this app is terrible. it is slow, has bugs, and it takes way too many steps to capture receipts and add them to a transaction - which should be the main selling point for this app. in fact, you can’t even add receipts to transactions that are “for review.” you have to add the transaction before attaching a receipt. not at all useful when you want to attach a receipt do your cpa/bookkeeper can later weigh in on which account the transaction should go against. my workaround is to add the transaction via computer, then go back in via iphone to capture the receipt, but i get an error message if i do this right away...have to restart the app to get it to work! given the choice between this app and a seasick crocodile, i’d take the seasick crocodile.
all that you need at the same app. great app, easy to navigate
online version is a work in progress. new to quickbooks online. easy to pick up. issues with duplicate transactions. laborious to shift in between screens frequently. not ideal for basic businesses. no ability to make an account inactive without deleting all transactions. home screen not useful. mobile app not useful for credit card transactions.
looks great!!!. keep the updates coming! great job of being quick to update the app and user interface and continuing to add great features!
good app!. add travel tracking to app
laborious expenses assignments. uploading pictures of billable expenses requires two lengthy entries...first at point of upload info is requested... but for accounting purposes only. second step is required to access list of expenses online and then manually retype all info listed under accounts into item chart...date, item, splits, quantity, rate, amount, check billable and then re-enter client to be billed. why this can’t be entered once at point of upload is rediculously annoying. my manual invoicing system took less time than this program takes!
good ap sketchy company. the app is probably good if you've already paid it's a great feature ill admit. but the company makes it hard to switch to desktop which is unfair. in 2017 their gonna make me a mac user use internet explorer?? huh?? everyone knows they don't make that for mac. i was forced to leave the desktop for mac version which was serving great. they no longer offered a version i could use to pay my independent contractors. i went to online. without a choice. i have since been forced to buy the most expensive plan to do what i used to do on the desktop for free. a company like this would gain more to be great to its long time paying customers. but hey, we live in these times it is how it is. dear quickbooks. show us mac users some love!
"passwords incompatible with quickbooks online www site. we live in an era where passwords from linkedin are stolen by hackers and used to commit identity theft by accessing victims accounts who used that same passord twice. intuit is certainly one of the companies targeted by cyber-criminals. it is, therefore, incumbent on software designers to urge users towards secure login practices. end users should use cryptographically complex passwords that are unique to each website they visit. this is especially true for financial institutions. quickbooks seems to do everything wrong in this respect. one such case in point: quckbooks ipad app does not allow long, cryptographically strong, passwords. detail: the ipad app will not allow users to paste in a password at the login screen that is in excess of 31 characters. passwords of 32 characters or more are, in fact, allowed at the quickbooks online site. this forces users to change their passwords to something shorter potentially reducing the entropy. changing the password on the qbo site is not easy and seems to require a call to their support number to complete. it's not just inconvenient but seems a bit insecure for intuit to force use of short passwords. it's downright irresponsible of them to not list what the password length on the login screen. this sends their clients into potentially hours of troubleshooting when a short line like ""passwords up to 31 characters in length"" would have solved the problem. please urge intuit to fix this issue and allow the same length passwords at the qb online site as on the ipad. --athonia"
good app, but could be better. the app is good but could be better with more functionality. for example not being able to add 'bills' but you can add 'expenses' a small change but would make the app much better.
great app. found this app so easy and user friendly for our small business 😃
cant even start the app. how to rate a app that not even running
almost perfect. just missing two things, edit or view notes online, and no touch id needed any time i try to open the app
bugs galore. i hvae been using this app now for 4 years and it is the buggiest app i have ever used. there are times where the app works flawlessly, and when it does it is a great tool, however this is a small percentage of the time. i would not recommend using the online version to anyone using the desktop version. the worst thing about the app is that you cannot transfer the content to the desktop version for mac.
not useable in multi-user environment. yup, yet again another update, and still not useable in multi-user. my business has more than 1 user account. locations and classes do not work in their accounts. how many years will this take to fix a bug that has been present since day 1? another update and i stand behind my previous review(s). seriously? another update, and still not multi-user friendly. but, oh boy, something works with apple watch. when will intuit fix the multi-user issues? someone else mentions they fix bugs. i can say the exact opposite - they leave bugs for years! i want to use and like this app. i've looked at every update since the very 1st version. it does seem to be slowly improving, but is still not useable for my company.
great app. extremely easy to use and has made doing my accounts a much easier and enjoyable experience! would highly recommend!
good app but could be better. overall i love the app. i've been using my ipad pro for traveling more but we need this app up to speed. in sales view i would love a simple addition to show next to the invoice if it was sent, opened or not sent. it's a simple change and would save a lot of time instead of having to open up each invoice. also, would like to see a total amount of outstanding invoices at the top, not just divided out in overdue and due. i'd also like in sales view to be able to sort by po number and invoice number. would also be nice to have a note icon next to each invoice number that if we click on it, it opens to show the notes we wrote. another note that i have been requesting on all quickbooks online apps for a while now is the feature the billings app used to have. a simple list of all the clients emails for that particular company in a list with a check box next to each. we can select our repeats to automatically select those for estimates and invoices. but we can easily click to add others or remove them. it helps so much to have all of those email addresses for each specific client to select from. currently, we have to go in to the clients info page and add the email there or go and copy / paste it into my email. both do not seem very organized were thought out for an app it's expensive considering the free app you took over had it before. plenty of large companies just bringing freelancers or they have different people handling billing. we need a faster, simpler solution to select company email addresses foe each estimate/invoice. please address these issues. if so i will change my rating to five for sure but right now there is room for improvement.
does not refresh. my primary complaint about this app is that it takes forever to refresh, or does not refresh certain things at all. this one issue is a huge annoyance. despite how many times i have opened and used the app, it still shows me my profit/loss for february (tomorrow is april). it also continues to display an invoice i deleted months ago, and when i try to delete it again it tells me it's been deleted already. so frustrating, especially because i am paying for the qb service.
great app -- easy to use. enough said. it helps me keep track of my invoicing as well as my expenses. great for small businesses.
tremendous. great app been using quickbooks over the years on desktop version specially go on mobile is the best way to go there is a couple tweaks that need to be worked on for example keeping track of inventory etc. and so forth been using quickbooks pro help ticket update these features as quickbooks from other than that it's a starter
dashboard is a great. the most recent upgrade gives users a real time understanding of a companies finances through graphical representation.
fantastic!. i love this app. it works really well, and makes it easy for me to stay on-top of invoicing my customers.
very unstable!. downloaded the new version but the app consistently crashes just after login. real shoddy development and testing by intuit.
would like to like it better. i personally like the ipad app better than the online version for interface, but it has so many bugs! constantly gives me error message that i'm not authorized to do something (add/edit a customer, etc.), but then it lets me do it. but i keep having to close out all the error messages that pop up. often won't let me email an invoice. won't let me add customer off of creating a new estimate (have to add customer, close, then do estimate and choose customer again). the list of basic things that should not be an issue goes on and on. on the iphone app, there is no place for my reps to view the contact person's name at the company! i'm sure there are other things i could think of, but i've just learned to compensate and work around things. however an app with this many bugs should not be out there - it's pretty pathetic! update 11/18/15 - after update, all the previous bugs are still there. pathetic to issue an update and not fix what was wrong!
missing. really enjoy the service helping me to stay organized, but the app is missing a lot of the features on webpage or desktop version
nice work. each revision makes the app even better. i did not appreciate the price increase but if the service continues to improve then it is valuable to my organization.
long-time holdout. i've used quickbooks desktop software since 1995. over the past couple of years some of my accounting clients adopted qbo. i have not cared for working with it, as it felt very clunky compared to the desktop version. a couple of weeks ago i converted my own company file to qbo. i found that it doesn't feel nearly as clunky when you are using it for your own business. i very much like the iphone version, which allows me to enter expenses on the fly. also, i can send client invoices right from my phone. very convenient. when it comes to generating a p&l or balance sheet, for some reason you can't do cash basis, only accrual. one thing i don’t like about qbo online invoicing where you give the customer the opportunity to pay by e-check, is that after you get the notice that the customer has paid # you don't see the funds show up in your checking account for at least a week. i guess that's why it's free.
stuck in data download. can't open app on ipad or iphone. stuck in a data download loop. support says there are no known issues, what a joke.
great app. i personally find the app easier then the desktop version. everything is quick and easy to do. raise an invoice or estimate instantly and see your bank account balance. great.
absolutely fantastic!. this app is incredible. having been using for 6 months, and it has revolutionised the way we are able to do business. so easy to setup, use and understand. i highly recommend to anyone that needs an easy order/invoice/sales system for their business.
not there yet. i run multiple entities through qbo, and have a very large volume of transactions that need to be classified/matched through the online bank transactions screen. the app does not allow for classification or matching of transactions, which is all i really want to be able to do while i'm on the go. until this functionality is added the app is useless to me.
quickbooks app. as a finally self employed electrician after many many years in the trade i decided to try qb online & it is quite simply amazing, easy, intuitive, versatile & very good value, looks professional and cannot recommend higher. thank you, matt m.b.s. electrical, jersey
great app. removed and reinstalled the app on my iphone. works fine
limited functionality. the app has very little of the on line functionality. and the on line version of qb has less functionality than the desktop pro version that i used previously. very much regret going to the on line version.
must buy two services. i’m self-employed and need to track miles as well as be able to send estimates. with “quickbooks self-employed” you can track miles but you cannot send estimates. with “quickbooks online” you can send estimates but you cannot track mileage. to me, these things should be doable with the same service/app but here they are not. plus, customer service is not educated on their product or helpful.
do not update!!! horrible!!. if you use this app for everyday business like i do do not update it. i have been using it fine for weeks ,then i updated thinking it would be less buggy, wrong !! the app doesn't even work now ,boy did i look like i didn't know what i was doing in front of my customer. what a horrible experience and canceling quick books right away and going back to paper invoices until these non brained developers actually test the software first.
cc payment signature window. love the app but, something was changed in one of the recent updates. the screen for the customer to sign to authorize cc payment was made into smaller window. every time you touch it to try and sign, it just moves the window up and down. you can barely make a single line. starting to get frustrating for customers and myself. please address this asap thanks!
loads of bugs since updating to ios 13. broken links. can’t call up customer information. dashboard only shows banking information. invoices and estimates haven’t saved when generated on mobile device.
great software. with each update this app gets better and better, great integration with turbo tax small business
time saver!. we recently had a glitch with the program in that our quotes and invoices weren't displaying correctly if sent from a tablet. qbo support walked us through the problem and made the changes to the back-end templates until it was rectified. invoicing and quoting should never be a burden. we are happy with the outcome.
headed in the right direction, but needs work.. this is a good app, with many great features. i use it to write quick estimates, or edit estimates written from my computer. however, there are a two major drawbacks 1. multi user doesn't seem to be an option. im hanging in for now to see what happens but if this isn't changed soon then i will be looking elsewhere. 2. they don't seem to understand who the app is made for. is this for tue small business owner, accounting, felid opps? i can write estimates from it so that seems like accounting is out, but not all the banking is available via mobile either. that leads me to say this app for the small, one person, business. i plan on growing...so what do i do then? please don't get me wrong this is a good app. i just feel they need to get a focus group on this app, and figure it out. i would like to see multi user support, with areas that each user can be limited to using. basically management, field, accounting, and even inventory to some degree could be using this system.
intuit is quick to take your money, but somehow doesn’t have the ability to cancel your account. i signed up for my business, never got around to using it. i finally decided to cancel the account. i had to call customer service because after an hour trying to figure it out i learned there is no way to cancel on the app. on the call customer service “doesn’t have the tools” to cancel the account either. i was sent to the website through safari to find out that there is no way to cancel or delete the account there either. thankfully the account was suspended according to the customer service representative eventually it will just disappear. great, that’s the best they can do.
great support. we use the app almost exclusively to keep our business mobile. recently had an issue and contacted customer chat to get it resolved. they had me screen record it happening and said they would push to engineering for fix. honestly didn’t expect anything fast but they fixed the issue and included it in the new patch. it’s been about a week or less so a big thank you the support teams for getting it fixed and getting us back to normal.
handy, but needs work. the app is pretty hand for some of my clients to invoice on the go or take photos of their receipts. i find it a little too dumbed down for my uses. i would love to be able to add delayed credits and charges and drill down on the financial statements. it would also be great to pull other reports, not just p&l and balance sheet.
great app but missing some things. i think this is a great start to the quickbooks app! it is clean looking and well organized. you are able to enter in or download transactions, refer to client information and many other things. my only complaint is that you cannot reconcile any accounts in the app. i would love to be able to reconcile. it would get 5 stars from me if the app could do that.
slow and buggy. disappointed in app. doesn't correlate well with desktop version. slow to load information and sometimes won't update accounts.
customer service is great.. had a little trouble setting up called customer service and they got me up and running.
excellent app. keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
amazing app. i love this app makes everything easier for me and faster. this app is amazing i just love it!
subscription renewal poorly thought out. i have been using qbonline for more than a year. it picked the worst time to time out and demand a subscription renewal. further it requires multiple logins and you must be st your desk top. nothing more frustrating than what amounts to a software crash when you are trying to get things done. huge fail quickbooks
getting better with every upgrade.. great app. they do lure you with the free use then hit ya with the charges later. i think it's a useful tool in the toolbox.
quick books on line and app. would be a great program, if it supported merchant services, and multiple customer pricing, i like the convenience of having it on my phone to bill customers. can't customize invoices either, so another issue. hope they make a few of these changes so i can switch from my desktop version.
need an important upgrade. i love the app and all the updates but we really need to information from journal entries to show up in the expenses on the app. it shows up on a computer but the app gives us false information.
works well enough. i'm not in love with using apps on my phone, so it was confusing to re-learn the app after the recent update. i can't seem to find some things on the phone app that i can easily find on a laptop.
same as other free app. wave does the same and it's free... once it's finish my period i am out.
immature!. this thing keeps popping up rate me rate me please! well so here you go i'll rate you. we got quickbooks online and paid for the whole year to try it out thinking we can always come back to the downloaded version. it is very limited...... you cannot customize your invoicing or estimates at all very very limited. you definitely are much better off using some other kind of software for your estimating and invoicing purposes but wait that defeats the whole purpose of using quickbooks online. yes it does and is such a pain in the you know what. so far i'm sticking with joist for my estimating and invoicing until quickbooks releases a much better customizable online version of quickbooks online. by the way joist is free. quickbooks online charges you arm and a leg and they got three different tiers so basically if they don't get you on the way in they'll get you on the way out. overall i am disappointed with quickbooks online!
slow books. can’t accept transactions in banking section. sluggish app, end up using the computer more often.
j’aime!. it’s a great app. i love it!
seems good so far!. i just downloaded the app, however for what i use qb for, this app is perfect and will definitely make my time more efficient. i am always on the go and hand-write all checks. from what i can see, you can quickly enter checks written (and even take a picture) and also manage your online banking. which is perfect for my needs.
great app. user friendly for billing and collecting payments. also help with keeping up with customers invoice balance!
fantastic app. the best bookkeeping app available. love this app. my bookkeeping has never been so up to date.
slowly losing my business. i'm about tired of this app not functioning properly. embarrassing to say the least when i have a customer trying to pay their bill and i can't even connect to quickbooks online server. none of your apps are working as advertised. $25/month for what again? vendor profile on iphone isn't in sync with current information online. trying to enter/view bills within a certain vendor and it's showing info from 2016.
expenses off. expenses are off. it’s showing expenses from an inactive account on the app. it’s correct on the website, so it’s definitely an issue with the app. i checked and the settings are the same. both should be displaying expenses for this month. also customer service was terrible. not one person was able to help and after five days of contacting one new person after another i finally unsubscribed. you should be able to assist a new customer immediately if you want to keep them long term.
cant update billing info in app. slow, awkward layout, intelligent prefill of categories usually incorrect slowing down workflow. will be using moyob to set up accounts for my next fy.
crashes a ton. this is a great app for bookkeeping for my business, but it crashes almost daily on my iphone. please get better engineers for the functionality of this app!! so frustrating when i’m in the middle of printing invoices and the app crashes! how am i supposed to conduct business that way!?!
very easy to use. this app is extremely easy to use and very helpful.
app crashes. this app crashes or cannot save my data on every entry i make. horrible app!!
poor service, poor quality product. this product is the worst i have had to deal with. service is non existent, the app is constantly in errors, backing up is slow, the system does manual and not by the operator, everytime the + symbol is used it closes the app. my accountant doesn’t even like the system. i have loaded, unloaded and reloaded the app so many times it’s no longer a joke. quick books tells me they fixed the fault, like never.
limited and buggy. there are too many features not included to make the app any use.
not bad. convenient app. not as functional as quickbooks online, but it adds to its subscription's value.
contractor couldn't live without it. i use this app every time i bill a client and can provide him with an accurate, complete invoice and receive payment on the spot. importing customers from my contacts is a great help. a must-have complement to quickbooks online.
crash books. this app constantly gives me error pop ups! it does not work as described and has a difficult time doing anything that the desktop version does. i have two different companies listed on my account, and the app never will let me switch between the two. it always load the same one no matter which one i click on. if you use a lot of features and have multiple employees this app seems to have problems. needs a good bit of work to fix the bugs.
love the convenience. great app
awesome!. so easy to categorize expenses and view financial statements in seconds!
quickbooks app. great app. really useful.
not bad. convenient app. not as functional as quickbooks online, but it adds to its subscription's value.
updates to features needed. i am a subscriber. sad to say that the phone and ipad apps are useless. they do look pretty but have none of the functionality that is useful on the go or made me convert to quickbooks online in the first place: 1)you can't access bank data or enter transactions. 2)you can't record bills 3)you can't process the pay 4) you can't view invoices that have mileage or time put against them. 5) you can't enter timesheets.6) can't submit or edit tax data 7) no access to chart of accounts 8) can't see or edit employee data! but you can access useless features that are just gimmicky: use your fingerprint to log in. view profit loss because that's where you do your deepest analysis, which frustrates even more because you can't alter anything. common guys get those features in and i'll alter this to 5 stars!
getting better all the time. still needs tweaking.. i use this app for my business every day, and the mobility is excellent. saves so much time in paperwork. i am waiting for a couple of fixes in the iphone version. 1. there is no way to change whether a discount is before or after tax as in the desktop and ipad versions (it's locked to discount after tax and to change it requires logging in on another device to make the change). 2. i'd love to see a couple more report options, particularly invoices by month as on the ipad version. other than having to log in on another device for these things, it's solid and i'd encourage anyone in a similar business (service industry) to use this app.
good app. it's come a long ways since it was first introduced. can't be without it!
useful app. adds a lot of useful abilities to your mobile device. i'm not a heavy user of it, but i have not had issues with it for months using the basic features.
awesome app!. best way to keep your finances organized!
quickbooks app. last update is much better. use for day to day operation and quick entries.
pretty useless. can't mark an expense as billable therefore can't create invoices by automatically including up billed expenses can't record deposits can't view downloaded trans action useless
i can’t do payroll from the app. it works great and is much improved from the original versions but i do not have a desktop/laptop pc........ only ipads and android phones and the apps limits my access way to much i currently use the chrome browser but it’s horrible only part of the screen is visible on the ipad some save buttons can not be accessed thanks for your help
buyer beware crash instantly on iphone 6. this app works sometimes but it will instantly crash and doesn't operate properly on my iphone 6 running the latest iphone software. i tried removing and reinstalling but it still doesn't work properly. why don't you guys fix this? also, it annoyingly downloads company info every time you open it which takes what seems like hours. i have a very small landscape business. should this be the case? come on intuit! get your act together
helpful. while not a fully functioning mobile version of qbo, this app is great for checking up on things.
app need more functionality. it would be great if we can do transfers and journals on the quickbooks app.
recommend!. quickbooks is a must have to swiftly complete business tasks like, estimates, invoices, etc.
a pretty good app. update: they added deposits! it does everything i need now, upgrading to 5 star! all in all, this is a pretty great app. it does just about everything i need it to while on the go, but it is missing one key piece of functionality. it does not allow the recording of deposits and that is really important for me. other than that it functions flawlessly and has never given me any trouble. overall, i love it!
doesn’t work for me in ios13. it doesn’t even get to the first page. tried uninstalling and reinstalling but same issue. please fix what is normally a decent app.
app needs work.. quick books does not see the main product of its service as the app. because of this, i believe they are not putting enough work into it. every time i open the app, it is frozen. i have to refresh the app to get it to run. i am not able to enter credit card return transactions on the app. i have to do that on the computer. i have spent hours putting together an estimate just for quick books to give me an error saying they’re going to delete all of my data. i then have to copy all of my data to screenshots and then re-enter the entire estimate. this is probably cost me 20 man hours in the time that i have been on quickbooks. do more work.
can’t enter, view or edit bills. this app would be great, except you can’t enter or edit bills. workaround would be to login to website, but then what’s the point of having the app.. just use the website for full functionality
"good app. quickbooks is just about perfect for my small business, one addition i would like is to be able to easily see a ""spend per customer"" button so i can easily add up the amount any repeat customer spend per year/month."
owner. don't do it! the customer service is horrendous. i have spent hours and hours on the phone with their people. they canceled my subscription when i went to fix something i can head no customer service. when i got the subscription issue corrected and then renewed my subscription they charged me twice for it, after that was corrected they canceled my subscription again. so when i needed customer service after that i could not get any customer service. both of those times good cook it shut me down for a day each. a little while ago i got there update for their online version. tonight i printed 50 invoices fold them and they do not lineup with my windowed envelopes. so i called customer service to get that taken care of. their suggestion was go by different envelopes. maybe i should buy a different software. i'm still having problems they said they will submit my problem to the engineers.
app. using this app is like being your own accountant. it helps keep track of your income and expenses. i highly recommend to all self employed people.
very spotty usability. honestly, i love the idea and i love quickbooks online, but this app is usable only like 50% of the time... it always seems to say ‘we can’t get all of your (payment/invoice/banking) details, try again later’. so all i can use it for is to see profit and loss for the month. would be nice if they could get that stuff fixed!
no customer support. this is potentially a great app, but customer support is non-existent - 3 emails sent and 2 weeks waiting for a reply to a subscription issue.
"add a little more. new to the app. ( 3 months ) it is a perfect fit for my little contracting business, customers seem impressed when i ""whip out"" the i pad to invoice them after a service call. especially the sign on the screen part. but on the vendor/bill side, a couple of more functions would be very helpful. mostly entering bills, in my business i have multiple trips to suppliers, so so i end up with a bunch of non mailed ""invoices"", it would be great to be able to enter them real time on the fly. right now i can only do it via web view and sign in with font that is too small for me, as is the speed via cellular data, not near as convenient....so the receipts pile up for the week and entering them becomes tedious. five stars from me if they can add the enter bills function."
constantly signs me out.. it’s infuriating. just leave me signed in!!!!!! even worse sometimes as soon as i sign in it says “please log out and log in again” this app is bs
loved the app until banking disappeared. i mainly use my computer to do most of our accounting but loved having the app so i could accept banking transactions during short periods of downtime thereby keeping our bank balance up to date all the time. then today i went to catch up on accepting transactions and banking has totally disappeared from the menu. help! what happened? i deleted and reinstalled the app to no avail.
saves time. transition good. works well. i hoped qb online would save time and allow us to stay current with renovation project costs and p&l. it has. transition from desktop to online went well. qb phone help was easy which had me running in a few days. all entry procedures are straight forward and more simple. i am starting to enter all expenses and invoices from my phone when receipts are fresh in my mind. 1q16 results were entered and up to date by 4/1/16 :)
bad customer service and bad app. i’m use only one month is the most terrible app. never used this app
desktop user samples online version. as the macintosh desktop version is being threatened by extinction, i thought i‘d give the online version a whirl. i was excited by the prospect of using an app and the unconditional functionality of being online. don‘t do it! do not do it! muy mal! the fact alone that intuit insists on emailed invoices feeding through their server was reason alone cancel and delete immediately. as a therapist who works in the eu, the privacy violations/implications of such a feature would open me up to more liability that productivity. guess i‘ll just go on and use the desktop version until mac os stops supporting that. boooooooooo!
electrical contractor. we really like this app and all its features. it’s fairly easy. i gave it 4 stars only because it is missing one important feature and that’s appointments. it would be one less app i have to download into my tablet and computer. it’s just a suggestion that would be so convenient all in one( hint hint).
"forced to upgrade to ios 9 - pathetic!. i personally like the ipad app better than the online version for interface, but it has so many bugs! constantly gives me error message that i'm not authorized to do something (add/edit a customer, etc.), but then it lets me do it. but i keep having to close out all the error messages that pop up. often won't let me email an invoice. won't let me add customer off of creating a new estimate (have to add customer, close, then do estimate and choose customer again). the list of basic things that should not be an issue goes on and on. on the iphone app, there is no place for my reps to view the contact person's name at the company! i'm sure there are other things i could think of, but i've just learned to compensate and work around things. however an app with this many bugs should not be out there - it's pretty pathetic! update 11/18/15 - after update, all the previous bugs are still there. pathetic to issue an update and not fix what was wrong! update 1/14/16 - even worse! now i can no longer add an item to an estimate or see the customer name on estimates or invoices under ""activity"". what is wrong with you people? if you can't make it better, leave it alone! now it is completely useless! update 11/7/16 - i absolutely hate you for forcing me to upgrade to ios 9!!! i have been suffering with quickbooks ipad's pathetic bugs for well over a year. i am forced to use it for my job because my laptop is old and i hardly ever pull it out anymore. everything i do is on my ipad. however, i have an older model (not by years, but by model) and after the mess updating to ios 8.3 created for me, i vowed i would never update again! none of the other apps on my ipad have forced me to do this. app developers are generally sensitive to the fact that not everyone chooses to disrupt their life by updating their device and spending days having to learn to use it all over again (and deal with whatever new bugs it brings to the table). you must have the absolutely lowest level of developers out there who first, couldn't fix even simple bugs in your app (like telling me every time i set up a customer or did an estimate ""i wasn't authorized to do it"" and then warning me if i got out of it all data would be lost. but it wasn't and everything i did was still in the system. even our boss got this message and she is the administrator). there were a myriad of other quirks we had to work around and now your solution is to release a new version, but in so doing force everyone to upgrade to ios 9 because your developers weren't smart enough to know how to make it work with previous ios versions??? shame on you! you would get 0 stars in my review if i could and if this new version isn't totally bug free, you will really hear from me!"
"dissapointing. update- now my ipad ap asks me to rate it, but it locks the whole screen up. kills me. used to love this ap. but it has been garbage for some time now. takes forever to login and load on my iphone (even slower on my ipad). once you are finally in adding new customers or saving estimates is just as bad. have called customer support to find out what is going on and received the response ""we know about the issue and we are working on it"". this was over two months ago. i was added to their escalation list and have yet to receive an update. horrible customer service. actively looking for a different direction for our business."
awesome for first-timers!. i am a new business owner and so far this is working out quite well for me. i’ll start by saying i’ve never taken any classes on business or economics, and as far as employment goes over the course of my adult life i’ve held jobs that require enough knowledge of basic accounting/billing, computer/software, (and other skills of the like) to get by on common sense. when it comes to taxes— that’s a foreign language to me and filing every year has been pretty simple (no major deductions, write-offs, etc. to worry about other than claiming dependents), so turbotax is typically my go-to. that said, and with this all being new to me, i’ve found that quickbooks is surprisingly user-friendly and fairly easy to figure out. there are still a few things i look at and i’m like “huh?”, but the customer support is pretty on-point as easy to contact (and work with to get help from). most of the app interface is self-explanatory and the layout is easy to follow— it’s comfortable, for lack of a better word. initially, i was going to rate this app at 5 stars because i’m diggin’ it so far... but decided to go with 4 for one reason only— i wish there were more options within the app (as opposed to the online version accessed from a desktop/pc). too many times, i’ve found myself frustrated because something i want to (or need to) do requires you to log in and use the website and won’t allow the action from the app... and i can’t always get to a computer to do so. especially since i work in the service industry (not from home or in any other stationary place of business) and i’m always running around or on-site somewhere, so my phone is often all i have to work with. that’s it. other than that, it’s pretty awesome!
limited functionalty. the app has limited functionality, can't see transaction details of any expenses and income accounts; can only see the assets and was told to use the browser version. can't drill down from a report to see the details of the transactions. touch id login is handy. so it's better to just use the browser version.
not that good, just ok.. the app doesn't do everything. so i go to the webpage. when i do, there's all these dumb invitations and prompts to use the app, which doesn't do what i need it which is why i am there in the first place. marketers, true to their nature, are ahead of the tech department. i can't see the whole screen on some of the webpages. unless i go to a computer, which defeats the purpose of qb on-the-go, i don't know what is in the corners of the screen. the bill to and ship to shown on invoices and estimates is mega-aggravating. it ends up the in right spot sometimes, at best. how can i present myself professionally when qb is making unfixable typos on my behalf? if you enter a customer, then change what you entered at a later date, it's like a baby bird has imprinted on the wrong mom and it can't be changed. again, professionalism is at risk. baby bird follows you around indefinitely. however, qb does lots of things well. it is probably the best out there, which reveals a kinda pathetic marketplace for this stuff. good luck with qb!
date range. how do i change the date range on the dashboard?
super functional..extremely helpful. quick books app is fantastic! makes using my phone for invoicing and estimates very easy! recommend to anyone..... no glitches, no hang ups..... you won't be disappointed!
quality product. i've just taken over the accounts for the business with little experience and knowledge and i have found quickbooks online very easy to use. issuing invoices and running payroll is quick and simple. the support is extremely good too from professionals who know what they are doing not just anybody in a call centre reading a script.
needs lots of improvements. quickbooks is good but lacks a lot of features specially now that the ipasos is out, 1. the attachment system should completely change. 2. slide over and side by side must improve as the app is not responsive 3. it does not recognize email addresses copied in ios (mailto:) 4. cannot send statements to customers 5. cannot add company stamp and signature on the invoices 6. converting an estimate to invoice, does not automatically copy the terms and conditions. hoping for more improvements in the app.
exactly what i need. the app combined with the online system does exactly what i need it to do. i can invoice clients as soon as i've left their premises, no more trying to keep a record and doing the paperwork later. invoice matching and bank data feeds make reconciliation so easy. this has reduced the amount of time i spend on my accounts significantly. goodbye sage, hello qb online. happy customer.
great app for small business!. i love being able to enter my expenses and invoices from my phone. very convenient and makes tax time much easier!
weak iphone app, no customer service. really weak app, no customer service. after trying to contact qb customer service, i got no response from anybody at qb. after paying big monthly fees $ i'm switching back to invoice2go, where i got great customer service and my feedbacks were used in improvements.
slow books. can’t accept transactions in banking section. sluggish app, end up using the computer more often.
simple and effective. i’ve always found the quickbooks support team to be very helpful and quick to reply to any question or issue. the app doesn’t do everything that you can do from a desktop, however the basic functionality works well and is simple and intuitive to use. i’d rather have functions that work well consistently. some navigations could be improved on to reduce the number of clicks but this is minor compared to the benefits of being able to do the essentials on the go.
great software for small business.. only complaint is that i'm always greeted by a pop up, asking me to rate the app, which i grow weary of, so here i am.
constant program updates full of bugs. qb - i'd give 0 stars if i could. over the past 1-2 years intuit has apparently decided to hire lots of useless programmers to write updates. my online reports don't run correctly too often suddenly. i get constant error messages. program freezes are now suddenly common. even things like the running totals in my registers disappeared in one of the late updates. why qb?! why?! suddenly my transaction order in my registers got reversed, supposedly because that is how bank statements show it that way. though not my bank. thanks for nothing qb! suddenly instead of just logging in with my userid and pword, qb has decided that i additionally need an emailed access code now to log in each time. why?! i already enter an id and password to log into my computer, and another to get into qb, and now yet another by email or text just to log in to qb. why?! why?! this is an awful accounting program. i'm a cpa and know how to evaluate an accounting program. i quit recommending qb to clients. and anyone in the market for accounting software should not buy this awful program.
i love quickbooks online. i love quickbooks online & my accountant does also. this app is really good for doing your expenses on but as far as invoicing i still do it on the computer. it's very handy for a small business. the fact you can enter an expense, take a picture of the receipt & go on your merry way. i'm sold.
amazing for small business!!!!!!. i started my service business one year ago and enrolled in quickbooks from day one. i can't rave enough about it! it's made tracking customers, invoices, and expenses so easy i can focus on my work instead of the accounting. still impressed and just in the process of adding payroll.
self employment. great app
not working properly after update #2. people have businesses to run!! i understand glitches from free/cheap apps. not something that costs $360/year. my books don't match from my phone to my computer. the pin still doesn't work, every time i edited an invoice it magically created a copy of an invoice that showed up 2 days later. now i have a ton of clean up to do in my books. it's time for me to find new accounting software.
