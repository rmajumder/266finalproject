awesome app. great app to compliment the web based quickbooks program, made my accounting tracking and hassles a thing of the past.
great program. i find myself keeping better records. very user friendly. great program
quickbooks online plus. loving the new updates with invoice tracking and the ease of excepting credit cards in the app. getting paid is easier and quicker than ever.
stopped working after the update. this was working great until the software update last week. now i end up creating multiple copies of invoices and estimates and the app just freezes on the saving screen. i can only finish off by logging in through a web browser and completing the task. please fix this fast intuit!
absolutely amazing highly recommend. way better then xero and myob.
does the job, but could be more beautiful. i was disappointed to find the iphone and ipad app did not have beautiful graphics, charts and graphs in the same way the desktop browser version does. i wanted a quick, general overview of where i was at rather than a line by line detail of the most recent transactions.
sign in issue. great app, except the need to confirm with text or email every time upon sign in!! would have rated higher with out this issue. very frustrating
newest update ruins app. after updating my app touch id no longer works and i can't receive payments and clear invoices anymore also it makes me sign in every time i open the app , before this update the app worked perfect and deserved a 5 star rating , you have ruined it and made it unusable , you need to fix this.
needs a calendar interface. great app, a clickable calendar link would make it more user friendly. also needs the ability to edit notes on products and services.
works, but..... did the update on aug 15. sending estimates from my ipad pro to customers they received jumbled text, not a pdf estimate. i can't get work when customers can't open the estimates. this is a big deal!
meh. still not sure how quick books became the market leader and they have been resting on their laurels for years. the app is no exception. there are lots of improvements they could make but they are too lazy.
"review. i have been using quickbooks since the start of my business, and have found it to be extremely useful!! i don't have one bad thing to say about quickbooks, other then for some reason, which no reason was given to me, i'm not able to set up the ""accept payment"" option it offers. if i could activate that feature i would give quickbooks 5 stars. until then they have a 4 star review from aj's tree service!!"
missing features. it would great if it could read data from receipts and auto fills the fields. i can't get my clients to use the app, because re silt entry is too cumbersome. reports are lacking.
incredible. totally simplified my accounting.. i switched from sage to qbo and have not looked back. easy to setup and learn. can send invoices from my phone in seconds. i recommend it to everyone i know!!
app is good support is horrible. call qb for basic questions lady name amanda hang up on me.. dial back in the she place me on hold for 15 minutes
customer service fail!. customer service is non existent look elsewhere
great app. this app has been a big help. flawless!!!!
the latest version keeps crashing. open the app and it crashes. try to enter a payment and it just keeps processing, not finalizing the command. i've tried it 10 times. i've closed out the app to reload, powered on and off my iphone, and nothing is working. please fix!
not good. app and site are actually kind of bad. slow to load. not enough options. will try xero soon
slow to respond from time to time .. the app is sometimes slow to respond.
joke. the logo option is s joke for invoices (1x1) inch
new update changed invoices. the app shuts down every time i get a signature!!
update is awful.. please fix the app. it was great until the last update!! can't even get tech support without it crashing.
crashing. since updating to ios9, quickbooks keeps crashing after the login!!
crashes all the time and there‚Äôs no way to ask for help.. this app crashes every time i update my iphone, even when i update the app. don‚Äôt even bother trying to contact qb about it, they‚Äôll tell you to uninstall and reinstall (like you don‚Äôt know) and then that‚Äôs about the extent of their support.
professional.. this app helps me quickly and easily stay looking professional and on time with my invoices and government payments
great for people on the go. has made business so much easier! can't send purchase order to vendor from mobile app
works great. good app. works great on the road for creating fast invoices on site. great companion app for quick books am dos fully functional.
we need an update for iphone x. we need an update for iphone x. in addition, we need the function to add cc recipient when sending out quotes or invoices. other than those 2 things, it is good.
doesn‚Äôt sync with quickbooks online account. the app isn‚Äôt syncing with online account data. was hoping to use the app for quick entry while on the go.
easy to use. quick books is very easy to use and i am able to finish my bookkeeping on the go when i am on the train or waiting in an airport.
good app. some glitches need to be worked out but very nice app to use and very user friendly.
crashes now. i used to love it. i got a new iphone updated it and installed quickbooks and it crashes every time i sign in. it says i have to download my company info every time i open the app. it takes 510 minutes to do so. i have contacted customer support multiple times. every time they tell me there should be an update soon and it will be fixed soon. it never changes.
good idea. i love the concept but i've had to reenter several expenses up to three times to get quickbooks to except them in and that's rather annoying.
help with my subscription. it says error downloading product information
glitchy software loses emails really crappy support. issues remain for years intuit does not fix. loses emails all the time invoices say sent when they are not.
crashes when adding images of receipts. i want to give it 4 stars, but the 2 things i do are problematic. crashes when saving images of receipts every 3 or 4 times. also i can't add time entries which would be incredibly helpful. really close to awesome though.
great app. yet again another update and even more glitches, you charge a fortune and cannot provide a decent service  i‚Äôm considering switching to a competitor as you have breached the contract that you have with me. this needs fixing urgently and you need to refund subscription fees! my advice to businesses and the selfemployed is do not use quickbooks!
crashes 3 seconds after loading.  every time it loads, it crashes 3 seconds after. unusable. even deleting and reinstalling doesn't fix the problem. come on intuit, get it fixed.
couldn't do without it. the qb on line version has really simplified our operations. the ability to have multiple users from different locations, especially remote access, has made life easier. either using a laptop or my ipad is great when out of the office. the only thing i've found that the app does not allow me to do is prepare a purchase order. but, there seem to be periodic updates so hopefully this will be coming soon. i would recommend qb to any small business.
paid for itself in one hour. after a long, frustrating search for a robust but simpletouse accounting platform for my growing fitness business, i came across quickbooks and have been exuberant ever since. my invoices go out on time, expenses go in live, and it even tracks my inventory. paid for itself in the first hour. highly recommend.
perfect app for any small business owner. as a qbo pro advisor my opinion may be somewhat biased but i can not brag enough about the software, customer support and resources offered by quickbooksintuit. qbo has allowed me to become a completely virtual bookkeeping firm, increasing my service area, customer satisfaction and turn around time. love love love them!!
great app. i love using quickbook on my phone. very easy to access and a quick way to send my clients invoice and get a signature! i'm definitely paying for this! it's the best app i could have downloaded to take care of business! üíØüíØ
instant customer service üëå. great app for small to mid size business. phenomenal integration from windows 10. so far so good. thanks.
excellent!!!. this is easy to use and very convenient! most of the functionality on the app means it's easy to work while out of the office!
stop downloading.. i have redone load company data every time i log on the app which can take hours, and essentially makes the apps convenience useless.
awful. doesn't work.. logs me out instantly every time i sign in... wish i could evaluate more. love the online version, but this app is struggling.
useful but slow. quickbooks online in general is useful for sending out invoices and estimates on the go, going through expenses, etc... however the platform can be fairly slow and sometimes glitchy.
essential for my small biz. very useful app. does have some annoying issues ( crashes,signs out often, etc) but overall great app.
tax problem in hong kong. i mostly use it to do my expenses, now with this update, they force me to input tax. but there is not tax here in hong kong. didn‚Äôt have the problem before. i don‚Äôt know how long they need to fix that. üëéüèªüëéüèª
not very user friendly.. not very user friendly. have to open the app twice every time i use it. it says critical updates required log out and log in to refresh. every. single. time. i . open. the. app. i‚Äôve tried deleting and reinstalling multiple times. when entering receipts it could have a search box at the top of vendor list do you don‚Äôt have to ask to search every time.
general consensus. customer support for mobile app is horrible. the mobile app really needs some help. they should travel along with mobile users to see issues and frustrations that arise in the field. i am a professional but at times this app makes me look very unprofessional. the should work on offline features.
crashes on ios 13. don‚Äôt install if you are on ios 13. this doesn‚Äôt work. it just crashes.
qb app liberates and empowers me. i use both the app and the online version to much satisfaction. the app lets me easily edit an invoice and see which invoice and recurring billing have been paid. i do use recurring billing yet i set that up via the online version at my computer. i can access my books on the go, and that is what i needed from the app.
the best business app ever!. i have been in business for nine years and have been using quickbooks desktop. i am now using the online and it is great so happy that i made the switch. works well with ipad and can do my work right on the site! thanks for the great work! ray's home improvement,llc
working great. app is easy to use on the go. some things are better done on desktop but for the most part can do a invoice from phone and accept payments.
"like it so far.... i am glad they have a mobile app to support qb online. i have used the desktop version for years but hated having to upgrade all the time. one change i would make is when entering expenses, i would like a ""debit card"" button with the cash, credit and check buttons. i use the ""check"" button for them now."
missing a lot... unless i missed it, there is nowhere that you can just add revenue. you have to add an invoice, and then apply a payment to that invoice. twostep process for a very simple thing. if i have a total sales report to add, it's not simple to do.... for a small business that receives sales income from a day at the farmer's market for example, this is not the app to use. add a revenue option!
not accurate, crashes often. this app goes from being usable to worthless on a whim. it also does not show simple things like how many $ in open invoices, (right now it says we have $488 in total receivables, when we have way more). the desktop app is fine, the ios app needs a ton of work.
please fix. we use quickbooks constantly. it has enabled us to grow at a much faster rate, helped us keep our books in order, and allows us to take online payments easily. however, the recent update has been causing the app to close unexpectedly and also has many other glitches. please fix intuit. we are not hating on quickbooks, but this is the worst update we have ever seen.
quick books app. good to connect and keep up with the business!
i like it. best app for your small business
quickbooks saves me time & money. this app has streamlined my business as i am always on the go. its easy, efficient and powerful!
qbo. keeps getting better
worst user experience. app is made of complex processes..i they are more focused on collecting data than providing service..uninstalled within 3 minutes
excellent. quickbooks online works great for me and makes my work much easier especially with the phone app
quick books on line and app. would be a great program, if it supported merchant services, and multiple customer pricing, i like the convenience of having it on my phone to bill customers. can't customize invoices either, so another issue. hope they make a few of these changes so i can switch from my desktop version.
does it. this software is what i was looking for, easy to use, available online, 24 hours a day, no matter where i am.
great app but missing some things. i think this is a great start to the quickbooks app! it is clean looking and well organized. you are able to enter in or download transactions, refer to client information and many other things. my only complaint is that you cannot reconcile any accounts in the app. i would love to be able to reconcile. it would get 5 stars from me if the app could do that.
easy to use. this app has been a life saver for starting a business and trying to keep the records straight. makes it easy for my accountant to access my records. good job quickbooks
needs more... this app needs to have the ability to process statements. then we would not need to use a computer at all. i was expecting to not to need a computer anymore and be completely self sufficient using my ipad or iphone. otherwise it is ok. statements is a huge thing for me.
qb intuit online app. fantastic program highly recommend üëçüòÄ
convenience. work, document, review with my custom needs, deliver receipts to my customers in one transaction and get back to work with my mind clear to work for a reasonably affordable rate.
great tool for simple bookkeeping. my business is only income and expenses and cash basis, no inventory, so this tool is great and easy. i do all my book keeping from my phone.
app crashing. after updating to the new version, app is crashing. kindly resolve the issue. not able to use
perfect app. perfect app
good app with room for improvement. the features they have work well, but many of the features on the website are not included. it has many of the customer options, but not much else. if they ever make this a fully functional app, i'll give it 5 stars.
doesn't send invoices. my customers stopped receiving invoices from me via email. i have to send it to myself and forward to them. customer service is a joke: they think their clients are stupid, their advices are just ridiculous: are you sure you put the email in the right section? really? i had been sending invoices via email before and they all received them.
nightmare update. it was bad before the update. how could it be even worse now? unending refreshing bank data (constant spinning wheel) makes it virtually useless and beyond frustrating for reviewing and matching transactions on the iphone.
so simple and quick to use. i have downloaded the app and have been using it for my self employed hairdressing. it is so easy to use and because i use my phone often it's great to pick it up at the end of the day and track my takings in which means i never have to worry about not being up to date. i would highly recommend this to anyone who wants an easy and simple way to keep detailed accounts!
amazing but quite buggy. it's an amazing too but there are a lot of bugs. the application is working for some features. it has been 4 months that i raised a bug regarding bank feed and it is still not resolved.
great app, very useful and always improving!. this app is the greatest tool in our businesses ability to streamline work, easy to use.
2 thumbs up. keep us on track and current.
keep up the good work!. i really like the platform. it is very user friendly. it has to be for me to figure it out. works every time i use it. no crashes. keep it up!
great app. this app is great and easy to use
missing key functions. whilst i understand this is a mobile app, even the qbo version lags behind in key functions from its desktop predecessors, all of which intuit has had ample time to upgrade to fully integrated functionality. intuit needs to put full functionality above the profit margin and put customers above dollars.
touch id stopped working with latest update. touch id stopped working with latest update. otherwise a great update. please fix!
great app. this is getting better with each update it makes. i you this app everyday to run my practice and it makes it very convenient because i'm constantly on the road and i don't have to sit at my desk just to enter expenses or send invoices to clients.
great app!. our company switched from quickbooks desktop to the online version which came with the option to download the app. we now use the app more than online. we handle estimates, invoices, payments, banking and more directly in the app and on the go. the app has a simple and clean look making it easy to navigate. to date we haven't had any issues with it. we are excited to finally be able to get things done in less time!
not bad. app is good. qb online is lacking.
needs some work. this app is good but needs more work. error message kept popping up while working in it. some tasks are missing like entering bills. can't find sign out button or switch to a different company.
so much better than sage. we moved from sage to this and haven‚Äôt looked back. the app is better and the links to banks work (unlike sage). the help and support is better than sage too. all in all, well worth a trial.
convenient, fast at a glance with limited functionality. this is a nice compliment to the full web app. i can get a quick on the go look at my books but would love to see more functionality for time sheets, payroll and reports.
ok app. easy to setup. big difference between windows version and ipad version. like the amount of critical info showed. on the windows version all critical info is shown. on the iso device not enough info shown. like cash sale,
good on the go. it‚Äôs easy to make invoices on the spot for customers and receive payments. i still prefer sitting at a computer but this app really helps while i‚Äôm on the go!
missing key features. most notably, there is no way to create bills on qb for ios. this is a major feature that is just not available without a desktop. i can‚Äôt even use a mobile browser to login because the web gui gets cut off when entering a bill, even in landscape mode on an ipad.
easy to use program. easy to understand and easy to use and to take care of all payment issue to leave me to do the work
app ruined. come on!!!!! the app is totally unusable now. can't save invoices, can't email them to the right person and can't create them with the correct info. this is the type of screw up that someone should be fired over.
major flaw  can‚Äôt add receipts to expenses. no dropbox or photo option. they advertise this system as super easy and convenient. you can‚Äôt add receipts from photos or dropbox. that makes the ‚Äòadd attachment ‚Äò pretty much pointless. i take a picture of an expense receipt but 0 way of adding it ... seriously. who designed this app.???
loved the app until banking disappeared. i mainly use my computer to do most of our accounting but loved having the app so i could accept banking transactions during short periods of downtime thereby keeping our bank balance up to date all the time. then today i went to catch up on accepting transactions and banking has totally disappeared from the menu. help! what happened? i deleted and reinstalled the app to no avail.
so far so good. i‚Äôve only been using a short time, but i like the speed and usability, more than on the desktop app.
good software, terrible support. it's a pity the software both here and online is let down by the worst support i've ever experience for a paid service. in ireland only email support is given, and emails are not responded to for 3+ working days, sometimes not at all. also issues are not resolved. i've had the same problem since joining the service 4 months ago which has never been resolved and when i repeat my contact weekly nothing is progressed. shame
review. everything is great but the inability to create packing slips from the app. kind of a key part of doing business...
improving but still a long way to go. like the new dashboard, but need ability to set ytd totals, more report options, does not show all my bank accounts. needs to be more customizable. app does not replace the website version, which is still needed to do any real work. best feature is the easy way it handles the bank feeds.
it gets better and better. i was a huge sceptic (i have been a pro advisor for several years)and very had a very negative opinion of qb online. that was until a couple of years ago when i attended a presentation of the capabilities of the software. i was sold on its usefulness and have been using and recommending it ever since. qb online adds important features regularly. buy it!!! you won't be disappointed
fix it!!!!!!!!. when it works i like it, but when it flips out it is so frustrating. every time they update it it takes another couple updates to fix it. leave well enough alone!
unable to access quickbooks through ipad. everytime time i try to access the quickbooks it says i need to verify first my login which can be verified by sending an email. when i choose this option it says the time has ran out and goes back to the login menu. i am able to get in through the web but never in the app
cannot download all data since last update. since enabling touched, after the last update, i keep getting notified all my data cannot be downloaded
a great start 5 stars once more features released. i remember when i used to hate quickbooks and especially their phone support. things very different now. i think freshbooks has set a standard in customer service that quickbooks is trying to match. the result? both firms offer first class tech support with freshbooks having the edge in ease of use but quickbooks offering more features. well done quickbooks huge improvement.
overall but problems. overall works well for small business. a lot of problems with checking account and credit card connections. one i am still going to have to sort through to make sure transactions weren't missed, as it only loads back 90 days. and you get no notification if an account suddenly disconnects. its a mess but customer service is good and they work with you well.
still needs some changes. great program when it connects and saves correctly. constantly crashes or cannot save work. you have to close app retry. most of the time loosing the invoice or quote you've created. needs addressing. this happens all the time on ipad app.
great app. there is no other app like it. this is probably one of the easiest apps to use and it is very userfriendly. i use it for my business and i have instant access on my iphone. you can send invoices on a moments notice.
awesome app. i really like this app, i can track all my incomes and expenses, it shows my net profit and everything else i could possibly need. i really enjoy using this app.
crashes too much, stressful. doing accounting is difficult enough. why did quickbooks create an app that crashes and creates frustration then?!
love the mobile app. they have made huge improvements to the mobile app. i don't have to access my desktop version as much. has greatly improved my ability to send invoices to customers in the fly. has decreased waiting for payments of invoices dramatically.
not to happy. it works but it's buggy a lot of little things should be able to see what you owe a vender not what you paid them. when you record a deposit you can't select the account it goes in so it gets put in an i deposited funds account. then you have to go to the full version to move it over to the correct account they swam to be very slow to fix bugs. a lot in the full computer version also
crashes on ios13. crashes on login as others have noted. unusable now.
excellent app for small biz on the go. invoice from anywhere. super easy.
app need more functionality. it would be great if we can do transfers and journals on the quickbooks app.
amazing product. great product for a small company. combining quickbooks online with the phone app is a great tool. being able to look up customers, create invoices, email invoices anywhere you want. i am also excited to be able to pair qb online payment with this also. all in all it's a great product for a great price so many things you can do with it.
best app ever. perfect for my on the go style of operating my plumbing business!
very limited. don't expect to come close to the alreadylimited function set of the desktopbrowser version. a real disappointment.
if it wasn‚Äôt broken, it would be much better.. when i launch this app on any of my devices, i get an error in the app that says ‚Äúunable to get all of your quickbooks data pull down to refresh your page.‚Äù
major flaw. the app ui is pretty good and i really like the interface. the problem is that a lot of my invoices are not even viewable on the app. basically anything that has a delayed charge on it won't show up so there is a major glitch there or something.
works well. i'm surprised this app works so well. it's much less glitchy than the pc program
great mobile app. mobile app has more functionality than online version. having the ability to take a note on a customer and add a photo. i only wish those notes were visible to the online version. currently they are not.
inconsistent. ipad app is missing enter bills. doesn‚Äôt match screen layout of online.
good app. it works really well to manage a business. a few things could be easiermore intuitive to do, but otherwise a solid app that gets the job done.
app problems. okay!! so for like 2 years, your app will not configure with the desktop version and none of the email addresses get updated. so in my case, i had been sending invoices to the wrong person and couldn't figure out why i wasn't getting paid? fix this like it used to work 3 years ago
great app. allows me to invoice on the fly. easy to get things done. i don‚Äôt have to be home to do them.
good, getting better. not all of the functionality that i want but features are being added. very useful for seeing what's happening.
business owner. could use more features and customization on forms and invoices. some basic functions are missing. otherwise helpful. would recommend for a small business.
love this app!. i absolutely love this app. it allows me to run my business efficiently and effectively!
stopped working. i used to get nice p&l reports on my dashboard. all those reports disappeared after latest iphonr update.
great compliment to qb online. been using qb for over 10 years. recently switched to online and added this app. amazing ease of use and highly functional.
this is not qbo for ipad. this is qbo invoicing and expenses for ipad. you got me all excited for a moment! call me when you have the real thing, please... i want full functionality please please please! the dream continues....
awful program. glitchy... no help at all from customer service, i paid my fee and they used it to open a new account instead of paying for the one i had. ‚Äúunable‚Äù to refund me... i spent three hours on the phone today with three different people, absolutely no help, no service, no one has any idea what the hell they‚Äôre doing, a very poorly run company. disappointed
crashing after ios13 update!. app is crashing after face id log in on xs max ios13
great app. for my business is been really helpful app. i'm a painter contractor, check job all day, if i need to send estimates and invoices now i can do it on the road.
phoned in. this could be such a cool extension, but like a lot of qb online, it feels a bit phoned in.  expenses show without account coding  what's the point?  report viewing is limited  dashboard is not customizable
must have!. absolutely vital to my daily business. clients are impressed when i produce an invoice on the spot and process their credit cards before i leave the job site.
easy to use. this app is so quick and easy. my business is on the go all of the time and it makes estimates and invoicing so quick and easy.
love it!. qb is stunningly simple yet superbly sufficient to handle our business needs for invoicing clients, reporting ar and preparing us for yearend taxes. the mobil app is equally impressive!
can't create new invoice. very troublesome considering this was an app i raved to people about its efficiency yet now i can't even create a new invoice and earn money... just paid for premium too. very disappointed and would like my money back for each day the app is rendered useless.
too many error messages. for what you pay for a quickbooks online account, this app for ipad and iphone is really disappointing. i get an error message almost every single time i try and enter a new transaction. sometimes it works despite the error message, sometimes it doesn't. but i get the error every time. i can't even access the banking functions as i get an error message and nothing will load. the only function that seems to work properly is the reports section.
always improving. qbo isn't perfect but it is always improving. this week's update included features for accountants to track their client's pending work, communicate questions and request documents. this is good stuff!
everything i need. the quickbooks app has met every one of my needs for my small handyman business. i love the ability to email customers estimates, invoices, and sales receipts while i am standing there with them. i have only been using the app for a little over a month but i feel good about my decision to go with quickbooks online.
it‚Äôs having to log in constantly. i‚Äôve been having a really problem with my ipad six generation lately, anytime i exit the app while writing up a quote and bounce backandforth between the information i need to enter into quickbooks. the app suffers a critical crash causing me to login several times with in an hour span. are there any bug fixes coming up? i suffer the same issue with my iphone xr and ipad pro.
amazing for small business!!!!!!. i started my service business one year ago and enrolled in quickbooks from day one. i can't rave enough about it! it's made tracking customers, invoices, and expenses so easy i can focus on my work instead of the accounting. still impressed and just in the process of adding payroll.
buyer beware crash instantly on iphone 6. this app works sometimes but it will instantly crash and doesn't operate properly on my iphone 6 running the latest iphone software. i tried removing and reinstalling but it still doesn't work properly. why don't you guys fix this? also, it annoyingly downloads company info every time you open it which takes what seems like hours. i have a very small landscape business. should this be the case? come on intuit! get your act together
software de gest√£o. excelente e r√°pido! me ajuda muito! parab√©ns! pequenas coisas precisam de ajuste mas que n√£o atrapalham em nada. podem usar!
awesome. love this app!! so easy and quick to use
multiple crashes. multiple crashes when trying to add expenses on the iphone.
very helpful. this app is great and so good to use while on the go to do invoices. would love if i could match up invoices to what's been received in the bank.
demoted from 5 stars to 4. using the app on ipad and iphone for more than 5 years. dashboard has been unable to properly show invoice status for at least 3 months now. version 17.9, at least 3 updates ago? no fix yet nor response from intuit after feedback. while i‚Äôm not fond of frequent updates, one expects to have these kinds of obvious bugs fixed in the next update.
worst app update. after updating the recently, app is crashing. unable to login
great app!. this app has saved me tons of time and i love it!
love it. still can't enter bills. bills are strangely missing. can do expenses. otherwise very nice program on my phone!
makes life easy. great app that makes accounting on the fly so simple.
app won't open after latest update! please fix asap!. app won't open after latest update! please fix asap!
update is buggy. the latest update won't save invoices correctly and doesn't pull up all my clients names. i hope it's fixed soon i use it daily. also won't allow touch id or pin sign in!
quick books. awsome app. helps when your always on the go.
very easy to use. this app is extremely easy to use and very helpful.
good app and makes life easier. it's a easy app to use and simple to navigate.
anytime fitness owner. great app. intuitive, clean & high functioning. just wish transfer money and a help link was a function. if it is, please advise.
crashes on large invoice. works fine until you get a large invoice and then it slows down and or crashes
can‚Äôt attach existing photo with ios13. with ios 13 you cannot upload an existing photo to a new expense. when you select a photo, the app freezes and there‚Äôs no button to accept the photo.
paid invoices not turning green or showing paid when they actually are. after receiving the payment, the invoices are not turning green and are not saying paid even though they are paid this is important and needs to be fixed as soon as possible.
pretty useless. very slow and painful to use, doesn‚Äôt let you bank any payments etc. probably only useful for those who wish to produce very basic invoices
couldn't ask for more. vary good app with great integration with cloud web service. i have been using this app along with desktop cloud version with my business for little more then a year now and find it vary useful and the app tops it off being on the road with no access to computer as long as they continue to upgrade and offer quickbooks online with app i will subscribe
handy for sole trader. some things aren‚Äôt available on the app, like editing your invoices.
signin process needs work. i allow fingerprint signin, but that option doesn't show up when i need to signin. i enabled twostep verification and set up google authenticator, but when i signin the only option is text message. the whole process just feels very sloppy and halfassed.
using new app for a week more problems longer i use it. really unhappy  i am missing data and receiving error messages and my only option for assistance is to use a form. am completely disappointed in quickbooks. limited functionality! come on intuit can't do any better than this and keep up with the times i have to use a computer or laptop to get full functionality?!
touch id rules. much easier to login now.
missing basic function. the inability to create deposits is a huge flaw with this app. quickbooks defaults to receiving payments to undeposited funds  you would think that they'd remember that when creating an app.
good program. does what it is suppose to do
great app!. very userfriendly and easy to use!
great. absolutely love it! i love the fact that i can access my reports from anywhere, mac, ipad or iphone.
excellent. really good app. carry your whole business in your pocket.
excellent. i been using quickbooks in various versions since 1996. i upgraded to online in 2015. as i am a working at customers premises, sometimes 15 different a day, the instant invoicing using my iphone saves me having to sit at my office at the end of the day invoicing. another great thing about online is to check any outstanding invoices from customers who request unscheduled visits.
works seamlessly with desktop version. i love that i can use the app to connect with clients while i'm away from my desktop with ease. the ability to send an invoice in the moment has been great to keep me on track while i'm on the go!
love it. this app is very helpful for the business side of my lawn care business.
great app, continues to get better. best decision i ever made for my business was moving to qb online. saves a ton of time being able to conduct business on the fly.
"frustrating. the number one use for this app should be to keep track of activity on the go so you don't play catch up at the office. for me, not being able to bill my clients for expenses through the mobile platform renders this app basically useless. i still have to remember to log in and find the expenses of the day and mark them as ""billable expenses"" when i return to my computer?!?"
love this app. awesome
"cumbersome. cumbersome and clunky to deal with. constantly checking to make sure i'm not a robot. security is appreciated but this is ridiculous and really slows me down. used to be good but got updatedtweaked""improved"" past the point of being useful. now i dread having to use it."
"was great until recently. this used to be a great app until a few weeks ago. now, every morning when we go to open the app it states ""downloading company data"" and does this for hours. we have customers needing to get estimates, pay invoices, etc., but can't because we can't use the app! this just recently started happening. qb can you please fix this issue??? this type of problem shouldn't go on for this long!"
great for on the go. i originally only used quick books software on my pc. it was still nice software but i would often find myself behind or forgetting to update my accounts. now with the software on my iphone i can easily update everything immediately. i have been using it for a while now and haven't experienced any problems.
needs improvement. i love the desktop version but my app version and even the online version never works right! there is always something that doesn't work. i always go through the whole estimate or invoice and then it won't save it for me! very frustrating and i wish they could work out all of the kinks.
count on almost $500yr in subscription costs. intuit has been very smart about hiding needed features in higher sub plans. get going for a while and you‚Äôll find you need the highest tier subscription. no thanks. hello wave accounting.
"it was good no it's just horrible. i used to be able to update my invoices from my phone and now it just locks me out. it also used to show when customers viewed my invoices but now it keeps saying ""it might not be up to date"". after 7 years with them. i'm going to find a new pos at the beginning of the year."
incredible. this is an incredible application. if you're looking to intuitively streamline your business this is definitely the app for you!
looks good so far. just started using it
wonderful app for freelancers. likes: stores repeat client info  allows for cc payment  allows me to include my company logo and information on each invoice.  alerts me of tardy invoices  provides me with easy to read charts and measure each months incomeexpenses dislikes:  credit card payments incurs a hefty fee rather than a monthly charge  all of my invoices have an intuit logo  customer service is not great
excellent app. make life way easy for small business
ios 13 problems fixed very quickly.. quickbooks is pretty good, the online version is fantastic. issues are attended to quite quickly. from a small business point of view, i simply can‚Äôt fault it.
nice app but not fixing known issues. this is a really good app and i would give it five stars except i keep getting an error message when opening up certain accounts from the chart of accounts. this has been going on for months and quickbooks knows about it and doesn't fix it.
waste of time and slow. i didn‚Äôt even get past the registration. the app was soo slow and laggy when i was trying to put my details in i gave up. couldn‚Äôt imagine the amount of time i‚Äôd waste trying to write up quotes or invoices on it. avoid!!!
last update ruined a great app. invoices won't save now and a customer file disappeared. please fix this app back to operational use soon!
easy to use and great for tracking transactions. navigation is straightforward and the software updates quickly
excellent. really good app. carry your whole business in your pocket. 6 months of using it and it's excellent.
getting better. you can keep doing more and more on phone. great for us small business owners. it would be 5 but when i first downloaded there was not a lot to transactions you could complete on app.
bien. bonne application qui fonctionne bien. assez intuitive et bien pens√©e. limit√©e pour l‚Äôinstant au recettes , reste plus qu‚Äô√† y ajouter la fonctionnalit√© d√©pense et ce sera parfait pour tenir sa comptabilit√© en d√©placement.
great app and fair prices. i do all my business through quick books and have had no major problems. the rates on credit transactions are equivalent to any other clearing house and at $30 a month to automate my process is a life saver. great simple to read reports too.
i like everything but..... i like qbo a lot. however there is at least one very big flaw and that is that you cannot make past due or partial tax payments through qbo.
excellent. j ai fait l essai d un mois et je suis conquis ! tr√®s bonne application tr√®s compl√®te et simple √† customiser  la fonction li√©e au comptes est aussi tr√®s pratique m √©vite de recopier toutes mes d√©penses √† la main
working great. have been using qb for about a year now. has been a great tool for an on the go company like mine. now with the self employed online platform, i might switch up. still looking at which will serve me best. overall great product and customer support gets an a.
awesome software. easy, user friendly, easy to organize and update!
great for start ups. i am wanting to know if it has been considered for users to use their finger print as an option other than the password to sign in on the app?
update crashed. i have all of my quickbooks point of sale ipads that cannot open the app since the update! we have all had to resort to computers and phones to run our business! you may want to consider this before you join up with quickbooks! they are notorious for problems relating to their quickbooks online.
great package. i'm on the road and this accounting package works great. also nice that my accountant has direct access.
quickbooks app. as a finally self employed electrician after many many years in the trade i decided to try qb online & it is quite simply amazing, easy, intuitive, versatile & very good value, looks professional and cannot recommend higher. thank you, matt m.b.s. electrical, jersey
not like the online version. the app is alright. missing a lot of feature (if you compare it to the online version) but if they come up with a solution and have them on the app version i would rate it 5 stars.
outstanding app!. owning a small business has enough headaches as it is. with quickbooks, estimating and invoicing projects and services couldn't be easier! everything is streamline! here's a look inside my day to day as a landscaper using quickbooks: initial client meeting> estimate delivered before i leave the property.. bam! they call back that night or the next day and we have the job. after we finish the project, turn that estimate into an invoice on site.. bam! paid! $$ in the bank!
a glaring weakness. this a pretty good mobile app. one glaring weakness is that it does not allow the manual recording of bank deposits and transfers so they can be matched later. this leaves you at the mercy of the slow banks before you can see these transactions.
great. i really like quickbooks, or use it for all my daily invoicing and i can honestly say it's the best one on the market!
sales tax calculation is wrong. when creating an invoice, the app does not honor customer's sales tax setting. it applies tax even on customers with tax turned off. please fix asap!!!!
buggy. super buggy and currently unusable. fix your app qb. we pay good money for your service.
great app. good app. better if it had tracking of vehicle km like the self employed version
app slow to load and won‚Äôt save transactions. this is a new glitch since the update
fantastic accounting app. i love that this allows me the freedom to work and to monitor my accountant's progress on the go. it's extremely user friendly and easy to use. many features save tons of time on simple book keeping tasks. smashes traditional softwares like ubs and myob into the dust!
from xero to quickbooks. i went from sage line 50 (blinkin' expensive but brilliant if your an accountant) to xero (very good for basic invoices but no estimate facilities on the app, no good for my job) to quickbooks online. easy to use. does what i need. reliable and relatively quick.
new business. great app, easy to use when building my own business.
not user friendly. quickbooks desktop has been a favorite in small business for sometime as it continues to get better in being user friendly. quickbooks online failed miserably at this. it doesn't account for businesses being different so the customization is limited to only what quickbooks allows for you to choose from.
rubbish. doesn't work. need to add bills but can't. how ridiculous to not have this function. deleted. no support from customer service
very satisfied!. been using the mobile app for the past 2 months now, and i can say it does everything i need. very easy to issue invoices, receive the money, match, reconcile the bank, calculate the vat! the support people are very helpful and have a lot of patience!
worth the buy!!!!. quickbooks mobile has made estimates and invoicing so much easier! definitely with the buy for any small business!
cancelar assinatura. fiz uma pergunta sobre cancelar assinatura e responderam algo na com nada. ser√° que voc√™s podem responder como cancelo a assinatura, pois n√£o utilizarei o app? aguardo um retorno obrigado
great software all round. quickbooks is easy to use and manage. software and app work easily together. makes small businesses life simpler. love being able to use app to do expenses and invoicing on the go.
zenith. great app for small biz
overdue but great! gorgeous!. this app is way, way overdue, but at least they got it right the first time around. no it doesn't do everything the website does, but nailed, adding buttons (functionality) is the easy part. it's definitely one of the best looking apps on my ipad.
update ruined a great small business tool. quickbooks use to be an awesome tool to let us send invoices after a job is completed on the spot. it also allowed a user to edit payment information anywhere via the mobile app. this is now all gone thanks to the new update. if it is not fixed soon, we are looking into transferring our accounts to another system.
excellent app. helpful reports and nice review of recent transactions to make sure operations are in tact.
this app is harmful. support is useless or you really can‚Äôt recover the emails you sending to the clients with your invoice
changed my life for the (much) better!. want to send an estimate in the time that it takes your barista to make your coffee? the amount of time that i save managing my business on my phone has cut my desktime in half. i couldn't be happier!
terrible support  avoid. terrible, terrible support. continual promises of call backs from customer support agents on live chat never happen because the bugs you find are too hard. open tickets for bugs never get resolved. you ask for a supervisor or manager and you have to email the person you‚Äôre complaining about?! get told that because of system bugs you have to manually delete the key back in multiple entries. you‚Äôll be left at year end with books that don‚Äôt balance like me. avoid!
great app, but!. this app has been great for my mobile business. invoices and estimates look really nice. like most mobile apps this one has many limitations. if you pay for an app you should get all the bells and whistles that you would get on a desktop or laptop computer. hence the word mobile!
awful program. glitchy... no help at all from customer service, i paid my fee and they used it to open a new account instead of paying for the one i had. ‚Äúunable‚Äù to refund me... i spent three hours on the phone today with three different people, absolutely no help, no service, no one has any idea what the hell they‚Äôre doing, a very poorly run company. disappointed
not happy. when i first got the app i fell in love i had problems with the desktop version , with the bank option on the online version witch you removed i was able to log in my transactions very quickly , i would appreciate it if you would please bring back the bank option in the menu asap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
mr. trying to type this review the second time. first time have typed up a review, i was told my chosen nickname is taken and the whole text disappeared! basically app is waste of time! not all of my set suppliers are displaying. for an accounting program it should be spot on before publishing. i would not trust this app. beware!
cis. 3 stars given because i can barely use the app to submit cis invoices as i have to use the webpage version which does not work very well at all on a mobile interface
not trustworthy. quickbooks has some issues with taking multiple accounts under the same email. i can not access my account because my email was used to open a second trial and i can not access my data any longer. choose better accounting software, overall. this app has no visible way to logout or troubleshoot.
very user friendly. great app for on the go people
invoices. i would like to be able to sort the invoices as they come in by day.
sales tax calculation is wrong. when creating an invoice, the app does not honor customer's sales tax setting. it applies tax even on customers with tax turned off. please fix asap!!!!
small business. i use it for estimates and invoices really don't use it to its fullest. but... i like it
needs to fix bugs. i love quickbooks online and the desktop version but their mobile app needs to fix their bugs. i told quickbooks support two months ago that i couldn't email an invoice from the app and they couldn't help me fix the problem then. i still cannot send invoices from my mobile app so it is basically useless to me.
amazing accounting software for smbs. great capabilities and integrations. only downside is the ios app is not always reflecting all data from the software. i believe this will be fixed soon
app constantly glitches and it's very slow. i've had so many issues with this app. lately it has been extremely slow, it randomly shuts down for no reason in the middle of inputting a transaction and it won't load larger invoices. i'm very disappointed as i use this on a daily basis for my business.
excellent tool for my biz. since i got this app on my phone i hardly need to go to the office, or open my laptop. love it!
finally!. this app does all that i've wanted  expenses and all. good to se qbo is working at this. love the mobile experience.
good app. i have used this now for two years. it works well.
app barely compatible with computer. the the features on the app and computer barely cross over and i can never find customers on the app that i have on my computer so i have to jump back and forth to make things work.
app is digressing. over the weekend, a change made the customer not viewable or searchable for invoices. extremely inconvenient as this has always been the case and now it has been removed and all you can see is invoice numbers.
newest update ruins app. after updating my app touch id no longer works and i can't receive payments and clear invoices anymore also it makes me sign in every time i open the app , before this update the app worked perfect and deserved a 5 star rating , you have ruined it and made it unusable , you need to fix this.
excellent app for small biz on the go. invoice from anywhere. super easy.
easy iphone app. i like it, it‚Äôs easy enough to navigate on my iphone. you cannot do everything that you can do on the computer but it takes care of most business.
quick overlook. i've been using desktop and online versions of quickbooks for decades. this online app is a great addition. it allows me to quickly update our bank accounts and keep on top of things while traveling.
excellente app!. excellent app!
useless. the app keeps crashing, if you‚Äôre in the middle of typing a long estimate or creating an invoice, it crashes and your file is gone, you have to keep saving your project, otherwise when it crashes, your project is gone. very disappointed, going to a different app or software at the beginning of the year, three years with this crap, paying high monthly rates, and for nothing.
wish we could drill down on reports. i like this app but wish that i could drill down to details on the reports. thank you for your work on this.
missing function. we need a mileage tracking function in this app, not only to selfemployed version, to integrate all the expenses within quickbooks.
update google signin never works. update: quickbooks support contacted me. i uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it works now.  i have tried and tried to get into the quickbooks app using the google signin. i get it to work maybe 1 out of every 50 times i try to login. i don't know why they haven't fixed this issue yet. i always end up logging in on my mobile browser instead. fail
great functionality. great app! great way to keep up with receipts on the go.
easy iphone app. i like it, it‚Äôs easy enough to navigate on my iphone. you cannot do everything that you can do on the computer but it takes care of most business.
app crash when opening. can not open app on my ipad version running on 9.3.5. this is last week of month and can not open app to print invoice for end of month. huge problem for me.please fix asap
highly recommend. i highly recommend this app. i run my business with quickbooks online and use this app daily. i use it to create estimates and invoices mostly but also look up look up costumers balances and run reports.
killer app. killer service.. the app is great, arguably better than the online version. great for keeping track of transactions and uploading photos of receipts.
easy. i have found this app very easy to use. being able to tap into your invoicing system when out on a job. it enables me to issue an invoice same moment the job is finished and emailed to my customer stood in front of me, that way my customer has a paperless invoice and can pay you right away. saves time!
quickbooks online is great. i love being able to add expenses while on the road. i appreciate the snapshot of where my business is performing. it is great to have a record of what‚Äôs going on!
almost perfect. just missing two things, edit or view notes online, and no touch id needed any time i try to open the app
can't creat po, and no calendar. cant creat po on ipad, and no calender,
i recommend for on the go companies. i have been using the app for a year and it has work great for me no downtime and easy access on my phone. great app!
have been waiting to get this app. awesome!. great app! easy to use. wish i can take payments from this app.
very easy and great!. i'm not a accountant but i found this app and the software great
business easy. i enjoy qb on my phone! it makes it easy to adjust, stay updated, quickly send or add while on the go!
can't save my invoices!. my app auto updated. now i can't save my invoices on the go. i use this app all day, 6 days a week. i'm in the home services industry and i can no longer invoice my clients, which means i can't collect payment either! get this fixed!
great invoicing and management tool. awesome tool to keep your small business running at its best. highly automated, making it very easy to work with.
love it!. qb is stunningly simple yet superbly sufficient to handle our business needs for invoicing clients, reporting ar and preparing us for yearend taxes. the mobil app is equally impressive!
enfin l√† ü§©. utilisant l‚Äôapplication sur mac depuis 1an, j‚Äôattendais avec impatience l‚Äôapplication d√©di√© pour iphoneipad, qui rencontre visiblement un vif succ√®s sur l‚Äôapp store des usa depuis un bon moment. je ne suis pas d√©√ßus ! l‚Äôapplication est parfaite, intuitive et tr√®s pratique pour mon autoentreprise. merci quickbooks üòâ
not a good app. too many bugs.
major flaw  can‚Äôt add receipts to expenses. no dropbox or photo option. they advertise this system as super easy and convenient. you can‚Äôt add receipts from photos or dropbox. that makes the ‚Äòadd attachment ‚Äò pretty much pointless. i take a picture of an expense receipt but 0 way of adding it ... seriously. who designed this app.???
whyyy. why on earth would any app ask dor my banking information and password etc theres an api for those theres absolutely no way for me to share my password with anyone or anything... zero stars
ipad mini. app works great
underdeveloped & terrible support. the software is totally undeveloped and does not have the features of the regular desktop version. tech support is horrific, they can't help because they don't have the knowledge. intuit had no business releasing the software to the public it's not even ready for beta yet. the iphone app is worthless!
nice app!. suits my needs...
excellent program. i am so impressed with this new app, it is very easy to use and very helpful for my construction business. i don't even have to go to the office to make an invoice i can do it right in my truck on my phone and send it. i can check on expenses... it's a breeze and worth the time to get to know this app and online program.
useless. can‚Äôt share the online app with my accountant. frustrating and useless!!!!
very good. one of the best way to do estimate and invoices highly recommended
update breaks layout in iphone xr. latest update breaks the invoices page layout. long client names force the amount column into a single space column. now the amounts show like this. $1 2 3 4 instead if this $1234
simply doesn't work. my companies all use qb online. i access it via browser almost daily. this app routes me to an advertisement to switch to qb online, even if i use the admin credentials. i'll assume it's something with all of my accounts and not a shameless advertising plug.
good app and service. after the last update, i can‚Äôt create an invoice after i add a customer. it crashes every time on my ipad. it still works on my phone. please fix this issue.
disappointed. just dont think its up to the invoicing apps others are. need to be able to add pdf attachments from the app. others can.
effective. efficient. essential.. began using quickbooks at my brothers recommendation. it unified our estimating and invoicing process and surpassed expectations with all the numerous functions. it will quickly becoming your single source accounting software. to add on to this review qb has become vital to our growth and receivables are paid timely. we have recently switched from square to using qbo's merchant services and have had a seamless process. fincite group
works great for me!. i love this app! it is nice to be able to create invoices, accept payments, and email invoices on the spot. no more waiting to get back to my computer for data entry.
app keeps crashing. even when i try to leave feedback the app crashes. no issues on desktop.
qb online. just upgraded from wui quickbooks pro 2011 to quickbooks online. this program is absolutely fantastic. i love the ease of receiving payments. love that i can take photos of my receipts paid to vendors. simply a great product. customer support was also wonderful in helping me get transferred from 2011
bugs!. so many bugs with this! i just rated it before and it‚Äôs popped up again asking me to rate. and i could go into so much more, however i‚Äôm only using this until next year. it‚Äôs shocking. i have just sent 3 invoices, the clients have received them, but they are not showing up in the app.
bank transactions not loaded. there are several limitations with this app. but my major issue is the inability to load bank transactions. the connected bank account goes sometimes for weeks or months without the transactions transferred to qb. other times they are uploaded every couple of days. there is no option to upload the transactions manually through the app. i called customer service but no one helped. this makes the phone app pretty much useless.
great but could use a little more. overall pretty great. clean easy to do basic tasks, would love access to a few more advanced features...but overall it's a great app. the app is stable, love the fingerpint login (even though it's still a little buggy at time of writing the review), it's clean & easy to read, good navigation. overall i'm very happy with it!
awesome app. great app to compliment the web based quickbooks program, made my accounting tracking and hassles a thing of the past.
good product for on the go bookkeeping.. i have more than a few clients i do bookkeeping for. this apple ap does a good job of keeping up with their books. the bank feed is by far better than the desktop version and it can be done on my iphone. i moved my company books from the desktop to qbo so i can invoice on the go instead of waiting to get back to my office.
online is horrible.. it is so slow and printing invoices is terrible.
update. says update required to use. i go to the app store to update and no update is available. been using it and working great till this.
app. grate app worth purchasing i'd recommend this to anyone
pros and cons. it definitely takes some getting used to compared to the previous versions of quickbooks i've used. but with some changes to what i'm used to and working with the software and its workflow it works out. the payments thing makes sending and receiving invoices works really well. adding expenses by taking pictures of the receipts keeps my clutter box of receipts free. still needs some improvement but my overall experience hasn't been bad.
bugs & functions. fair but still a lot of bugs with tablets. mis more functions like crm programs. and would nice to have more control clients groups, commissions, as well as price list, like ,distributions, whole sale, or final client...
very limited... quickbooks is one of the best accounting tools out there... however this app is very limited. ipad is a very powerful device. but this app doesn't take advantage of that. things like: * auto save invoices to the files app * option to choose payment type * when you paste an email from the email apps, it doesn't recognize those emails.. * option to add company stamp and seal to the invoices
first class. really a great app makes life easier
qbo. very helpful with creating invoices.
would be better if i could manage payroll on the app. i would love to be able to do up my company‚Äôs payroll on the fly if i‚Äôm out on a job site or on a business trip. please fix this
doesn't send invoices. my customers stopped receiving invoices from me via email. i have to send it to myself and forward to them. customer service is a joke: they think their clients are stupid, their advices are just ridiculous: are you sure you put the email in the right section? really? i had been sending invoices via email before and they all received them.
easy. easy to use, and has all the features i need to run my lawn care business. i recommend it to everyone. my only issue was getting my subscription paid for. i worked it out by calling customer service and they were awesome.
silly errors. there are a few silly things that would be so easy to correct. invoice design, and worst of all sending a customer a copy of a paid invoice shows invoice amount as 0.00. not the actual amount and paid.
fonts too big and can‚Äôt be read anymore. since the latest update, fonts are too large and you can‚Äôt read the amounts of your invoices anymore. sent them many screenshot examples, still can‚Äôt use the app anymore. also, sometimes you can‚Äôt even ‚Äúaccept‚Äù an invoice on the app as well. useless for me to use now. what a shame, because i used it daily. iphone 11 pro with latest ios v13.2.2
latest version is a disaster. face recognition does not work at all. you have to sign in every time you open the app and often get kicked out especially when switching between companies. colossal waste of time.
excellent. this app is making a huge difference to our business management. real time visibility of important financial data! to improve, id love visibility of scheduled bills, plus ability to make part payments to invoices. terrific!
great app. love this app!
"works great for my business needs. i can send estimates quickly and they look professional. one feature i really enjoy is knowing my customer has viewed the estimate! occasionally the ""+"" arrow doesn't seem to respond on the app... otherwise i'm very pleased. dc"
app ruined. this is getting old. the app seems to be unusable every time an update heads out way. my invoices are showing old data, are not updating to show payments and do not match what is correctly shown in the real online desktop service. please fix , and stop updating prior to testing
ipad. does not work with ipad pro screen that well
excellent for the it service provider. as an it service provider, this app allows me to log my hours and mileage in the field. i can even email customer invoices immediately after services are performed. this is, of course, paired with quickbooks online plus, which allows you to log hours per customer. highly recommended!!
awesome!. absolutely love this app. i am able manage all of my clients on the go, create invoices and receive payments. the only issue i have is that it won't allow me to email invoices or provide the pay online option.
business owner. used desktop for years and now after switching to imac and iphones this app is perfect and couldn't be easier. recommend this to anyone looking for an accounting app.
very easy to use. very user friendly
pretty good. very clean interface, and decent functionally, though still lacks many important features, but seems to be improving
"keep getting ""session expired"" message with every log in attempt. completely makes the app nonfunctional for on the go business. critical flaw! please fix it!! oh, and the link for support is dead... come on folks, gimme a chance here!!"
a+. app works great
professional and practical. love this app! makes my business paperwork so much easier!
ios 13. i‚Äôve updated my iphone 8 to ios 13 and quickbooks won‚Äôt load at all. i‚Äôve deleted and re uploaded the app and it‚Äôs the same. any updates coming soon for the app? other than that, don‚Äôt update your phone if you rely on quickbooks in your phone
no sales receipts. this app is pretty decent, but lacks the essential functionality of sales receipts. gopayment isn't a solution either because it doesn't link to customers. when can we expect sales receipt functionality?
great app. good for a non accounting person like me. i can keep track and give it all to my accountant and it gets done. i love that i can send invoices from my ipad and enter info etc. two thumbs up!
three years using qbo. very dissatisfied.. bugs and more bugs. slow and clunky functionality. bait and switch pricing. no way to communicate effectively with qbo as they are pro forma all about feedback and customer service however the poor souls tasked with providing it have no two way communication with the people who actually code this bug ridden system. i am actively looking for other solutions that provide ipad and iphone data entry.
good app. helps me run my business in paperless mode. crashes when i push terms while creating invoice or estimate. please fix this.
great app. far easier to use than desktop quickbooks. great software
ios 13 and later app crashes. the app works well prior to ios 13.0 when opened in an iphone running ios 13 later, the app crashes after faceid login.
doesn't work for ipad. this app doesn't even load my company info. it keeps returning error trying to load company info. i have contacted quickbooks a number of times and all they say is they are working on the issue and to use a web browser version in the mean time. i have seen about 4 updates released and not one of them has fixed this issue. when will this be fixed?
terrible, embarrassing. after purchasing and downloading the app, it worked fine on day 1. tried to open it and show it off...it would not open. the next day, i gave it another chance. i successfully created an invoice template and then tried to edit a service. the app then froze. i will obtain a full refund and never give this another look.
probably will uninstall it. not user friendly. won't post memorized transactions. i erroneously posted transactions as expense instead of checks. it won't let me edit them.
works perfect. i enjoy using qb it allows me to send invoices from where ever i'm at also i can except payments from the field. it's been awesome to run my small business for 2 years.
fix crash. my quickbooks app was crashing on my ipad 3, after i did the upgrade. press and hold the app icon and uninstall it. then, download it again. it now works.
app constantly glitches and it's very slow. i've had so many issues with this app. lately it has been extremely slow, it randomly shuts down for no reason in the middle of inputting a transaction and it won't load larger invoices. i'm very disappointed as i use this on a daily basis for my business.
great app. can do so much on the app. would be even better if could prepare bills in the app.
excellent customer support. not only is this an awesome product, but the customer support is top of the line. every tech i've spoken to is knowledgeable and professional. data integrity is very high. definitely recommend.
functionality bugs. app works pretty well but have noticed a lot of features do not work from time to time. the logo for instance does not allow me for the past few days to upload or make changes. then all of sudden it may work or process. other then that the app seems to work great and fast.
lacking functionality. if you have multiple accounts you have to sign in and out individually. additionally, this app has still not been updated for the latest iphone and ipad graphic sets such as the ipad pro.
still can't create po's through app. i use quickbooks for 2 things mainly. to create estimatesinvoices and send pos once the invoice has been paid. i can't create po's with the app so it's useless. i have to go to the website every time i want to create a po. it makes no sense that they would leave this feature out.
great accounting apps. great apps..
omg. if you don't have it you are missing out. this is the easiest and most helpful app ever.
zero stars new version is junk. i used this app several times a day. i run my business on this app. since april 10th i cannot access my data. my business is suffering and intuit cannot fix it. i still have to pay. tech support at intuit  quickbooks recommended i switch to a android. (i doesn't work on my iphone or ipad) i really do not want to invest in new hardware. stay away from intuit they do not care and offer no solutions.
multiple crashes. multiple crashes when trying to add expenses on the iphone.
adding a photo to a receipt should be simple. apparently there was a recent update that removed the add photo option to tranasactions. it's not there any longer. i called support and they tell me i have to create a note, add the photo to that note, then go find the transaction and add the note to it.
please add more search options. this is a great app to accompany a great service. my only request is that i be able to search for content within invoices themselves. for faster lookup!
qb app. product has improved greatly since its first launch. still room for improvement. i wish you could add time activities like you can in the online version.
not great, but no other options on phoneipad. this is terribly buggy software. intuit is not on the ball with development. enter a transaction or invoice on this app, then find it not entered on quickbooks online. won't sync. menus don't work or show on the ipad or iphone. called intuit and they said it's still a young app and they're working on it. i have little faith. hope this all gets fixed.
app stopped loading after ios update. please fix
great app. i have been using quickbooks for about a year now. it's has been a major asset to my business. it made filing my taxes quick and easy too.
after 3 years qb stops working. spent hours on the phone with support. no solution. cannot add items to an invoice. i'm a distributor so mobile is pretty important. sorry qb pretty disappointed with your product.
it just works. it works well across all platforms. laptop pc, ipad, android phone. i am very pleased with it. still so much that i need to learn as i don't know much about business.
fail update.. update never savessends invoices on either of my 2 devices
excellent online software. i love this system made my job a lot easier my phone is my office
awesome app. this is a brilliant app. i have all my invoices and expenses at my fingertips. very easy to use and synchs perfectly with qbo on my mac. keeps me on track with daily reminders of overdue invoices. no one gets away with not paying me now.
good app. i like simple, this is efficient for my small busines, updates are making the app better. i can recomend it is supper easy to use.
poor. slow, clumsy. there are far better apps on the market. don't waste your money.
needs to be full featured. i love the program but hate that i can‚Äôt do into my vendor bills on the app for ipad. i can‚Äôt enter them in or view them on ipad. i can on browser view but even it needs to update as everything gets cit off in chrome and when you click the menu button to hide it it does not slide everything over so you can see more.
fantastic. great bit of kit can do everything i need on the go send invoices and put in my expenses
not good support. the app is ok, but if you require support, it is not there.
wow!. really cool app! it's linked on all my device! i can make invoices on my phone and send it to my clients directly from email! cool stuff!
since ios 13 update not working. since ios 13 update not working so frustrating
overall good product. not having access to the entire online tools on the app makes for complicated tasks at times. the online browser does not run fluently with a safari browser so if i need anything beyond basics i need to get to a pc.
very good app. if i could link my icall to it, it would be perfect 5 stars
cannot edit suppliers at all with the ipad app. i think the title says it all. i started an invoice from a supplier, however i cannot continue it on the ipad. it is just impossible! it just cannot be done. so it is for that reason only i am giving it one star. on the computer it is great, the ipad app is useless.
every update breaks it. first off would like to say i love this program. works well for our business. the problem is that every update tends to break the software. i'm unable to create invoices on my ipad air 2 or iphone 6 plus. trying to select an item for the invoice (ie. general labour or equipment) doesn't work. hopefully will be fixed soon then i'll update the stars.
outstanding app!. owning a small business has enough headaches as it is. with quickbooks, estimating and invoicing projects and services couldn't be easier! everything is streamline! here's a look inside my day to day as a landscaper using quickbooks: initial client meeting> estimate delivered before i leave the property.. bam! they call back that night or the next day and we have the job. after we finish the project, turn that estimate into an invoice on site.. bam! paid! $$ in the bank!
loss of functionality. i had been using this app for a while without any real issues. however, recently the 'expense' button that pulls up from the '+' menu on the home screen is grayed out...thus rendering the app fairly useless on the go! intuit said they unfortunately didn't have the ability to fix issues with the app.
kenneth w. elliott sr.. easy to use and easy to personalize almost everything. would like to be able to change the quickbooks automatic invoice number to suit my needs. wish it had quarterly tax payment capability though and be able to send them to the irs.
"great app. excellent app that integrates with lots of other apps i use. it has saved me many hours doing my accounts. (game changer for sure!)  i just wish i could change the wording ""shipping address"" to ""property address"" but maybe in time"
hate the app. limited functionality of the app makes it virtually useless... unless i have access to a pic or laptop, i can't do all the things i need to do. the program itself is good, just not sure why the app hasn't caught up yet.
excellent business app. a must have for small businesses. excellent.
best app. very helpful online support
waste of time and slow. i didn‚Äôt even get past the registration. the app was soo slow and laggy when i was trying to put my details in i gave up. couldn‚Äôt imagine the amount of time i‚Äôd waste trying to write up quotes or invoices on it. avoid!!!
rockin. full throttle on the go. just buy it, you want regret it.
missing functionality. reliable app but authentication is too slow. also some features aren't available. i sometimes just use the web app through the browser to access those features.
great program for what is asked of it.. great program (i use desktop app on my macbook pro). but constant ‚Äúimprovements ‚Äú make it hard to find menus you once had. needs a one click solution to print all open invoices at once. biggest complaint is i get thrown off a few times a week. it‚Äôs a quick reload, and i have not lost any data, but annoying.
good program. as a small business quickbooks online works great for me. being able to access all of my business information from all my devices is awesome!
app fails to load on iphone x. failed to start in iphone 6s and iphone x
crashing. since moving to iphone11 pro  the app keeps crashing. can‚Äôt even access it! please fix this as i have to upload receipts to my laptop to add to quickbooks! ain‚Äôt nobody got time for that........
good app. overall this is a good app, would be nice to have more features such as gp% per job or integration with credit card payment
good to review. i haven't got deep into it to create billing invoices yet but just to review what i've done from the work station, it's great.
love quickbooks  improvement always appreciated. i really live the ease of use of quickbooks. the desk top and mobile app are pretty clean. keep building off such a great product. the down side is that some transactions such as bundling downloaded client reimbursable expenses & linking to a single invoice are not intuitive.
works well but sometime updates break it so update with caution.. about every 6th update seems to have an error. overall its great.
excellent. i find this so easy to use and only use s small part of it. i can finish a job and invoice from the clients driveway using my phone!
brilliant!. easy to use, matches payments received and ties them off with your invoices, easy to see profit and expenses for each month. well worth the monthly payment, my books have never been so easy to keep!
landscape company. i like this app as it helps me stay on top of the billing before i leave the site. but the client care and billing is horrible customer care is the worst in north america. stay far away from this company. they bill you when they are not suppose to.
so easy. this app is user friendly and intuitive. i like being able to see the reports and add attachments to expenses. highly recommended for small businesses owners.
easy to use!. love the app!
"latest upgrade is a disgrace. i have never written a negative review of an upgrade, but the latest version of this app made a great app totally useless. you can no longer receive invoices or reconcile bank balances. do yourself a favor and delete the quickbooks app rather than ""upgrade."" the mobile website is more useful than the app."
really helpful!!. i am a computer engineer and being able to make estimates and invoices in the field has really helped me!
slow, expensive and with poor support. i have been using quckbooks for a year now. it's terribly slow on here and also on the pc, the support is dire, and mostly just does not respond. the only thing that happens quickly in this app is the removal of service if you fail to pay your subscription. avoid! now i'm looking for an alternative that i can migrate my business info etc to without too much fuss.
fonts too big and can‚Äôt be read anymore. since the latest update, fonts are too large and you can‚Äôt read the amounts of your invoices anymore. sent them many screenshot examples, still can‚Äôt use the app anymore. also, sometimes you can‚Äôt even ‚Äúaccept‚Äù an invoice on the app as well. useless for me to use now. what a shame, because i used it daily. iphone 11 pro with latest ios v13.2.2
awesome app. this is a brilliant app. i have all my invoices and expenses at my fingertips. very easy to use and synchs perfectly with qbo on my mac. keeps me on track with daily reminders of overdue invoices. no one gets away with not paying me now.
still unresolved issues 3 month later. i‚Äôve had quickbooks for over 3 month now and since i‚Äôve had it i have been unable to allocate my bank transactions on my app. i‚Äôve flagged this to quickbooks and had responses but no fix. keep being told to use desktop version for now! 3 months and still not fixed isn‚Äôt good enough for a payed for app.
great app. i love this app
"few fixes. overall great. great app. only things i'd like to see are invoice signatures like on the ipad and to be able to search sub products by the parent product name like on the pc version. ie our product ""pale ale"" sub product ""12bbl""doesn't show up in the search for pale ale"
doesn't work. won't open on the ipad
great app. rich in features and great for staying on top of things whilst on the go
how bad????. i would love to write a review, but as i've been trying to get this app to log in to my online account for 5 months now it's going to be a little difficult. but not as difficult as trying to get any customer support for this app. i could write a whole book on how impossible that is. so so disappointed. no help with this problem what so ever. frustrated!!!!!
great invoicing app. works great for invoicing needs.
slow to respond from time to time .. the app is sometimes slow to respond.
qb makes me look good. qb app is fantastic. i can write and present an estimate right at the job site or give my customer an invoice, or accept payment. in brief....it makes me look good!
boost to my business image with my ipad!. i went from handwriting every estimate, sales receipt and invoice to bringing in new paperless technology. at the end of the day i would have to have my wife input everything in our quick books online. then file everything in our office. it's not only impressive to our clients, but it also eliminates filing and an extra step of data entry, it saves time and money and gives you a competitive edge over your competition!
much help. other then the normal bugs, this program works well and is easy to work with. nothing in this life is perfect but they strive to make it so. thank you staff of quick books. keep up the good work. peace & blessings.
so easy. this app is user friendly and intuitive. i like being able to see the reports and add attachments to expenses. highly recommended for small businesses owners.
okay. this app would be perfect if it didn‚Äôt redirects me to safari to login every single time
amazing appsÔºÅ. so amazingÔºÅ
what did you do with the functionality?. there is nothing to work with here. qbo has gone from bad to worse. what happened to the 'almost desktop version' i saw in beta?
it's ok not bad. it does the primary functions fine. gives you a decent insight with the new dashboard. one glitch is that it shows deleted invoices as past due.
i love it!. great app haven't seen anything better.
quick books online. good for customer data base. good for invoicing and receiving payments. fair at tracking expenses. near useless as an accurate or bookkeeping tool when linked to a bank account. so many obscure and poorly explained manual actions required that error is easy to introduce and tech support usually makes things worse. one may as use good old fashioned paper ledgers and a calculator. don't trust it with your numbers!
crashes 3 seconds after opening. latest version is completely unusable on both iphone and ipad. crashes 3 seconds after opening. both on iphone and ipad. did anyone actually test this?
does not attach invoices when emailed. i was excited to finally see this app be available. everything i need to do is included. however... i've noticed that when i email out an invoice from the ipad app to a pc, the recipient does not get the attached or embedded invoice. i hope this gets corrected soon, it's very annoying.
zero stars new version is junk. i used this app several times a day. i run my business on this app. since april 10th i cannot access my data. my business is suffering and intuit cannot fix it. i still have to pay. tech support at intuit  quickbooks recommended i switch to a android. (i doesn't work on my iphone or ipad) i really do not want to invest in new hardware. stay away from intuit they do not care and offer no solutions.
worth the buy!!!!. quickbooks mobile has made estimates and invoicing so much easier! definitely with the buy for any small business!
dead in the water here.. i have been using qb on line for a while now. there is still a lot of bugs that will drive you out of your skin, and nobody gives a dam. today the app updated and now i can‚Äôt even get in. waisted my entire evening reseting my password and still nothing. i have had it with qb!
don't update the app!. i updated the app this morning and similar to other reviews, i can't use touch id. i have to enter in password every time. i'm unable to save a payment to an invoice also. hoping this gets resolved soon. previous version was flawless.
needs work. i want to be mobile but this app won't let me select different dates for items on invoices or employee hours. please make it more functional.
great invoicing app. works great for invoicing needs.
amazing app. so great to use! still missing few features but gets the job done
support. very sad that for a pay per month app does not work properly. have emailed support on numerous occasions with no response.
cwcsoil.com operations. the currentline version is the best ever! on my ipad pro, a dream!
ios 13 not supported. the app will not even start!
latest update breaks button controls. the latest version of quickbooks won‚Äôt allow bank transactions to be accepted or modified. none of the button links work.
deleting app from phone and reinstalling fixed crash. had crashing problems with update. deleting and reinstalling solved the problem.
after update statements wont scroll down. after bug fix for ios13, statements wont scroll down. please fix
awesome app. i really like this app, i can track all my incomes and expenses, it shows my net profit and everything else i could possibly need. i really enjoy using this app.
online version is a work in progress. new to quickbooks online. easy to pick up. issues with duplicate transactions. laborious to shift in between screens frequently. not ideal for basic businesses. no ability to make an account inactive without deleting all transactions. home screen not useful. mobile app not useful for credit card transactions.
hopeless. ever since my accountant asked to use it, the app is never able to retrieve any data keeps giving a message to say ‚Äòunable to retrieve data‚Äô. what‚Äôs the point of the app if i can‚Äôt see the dashboard and data when i need to?
excelente. muy buena aplicaci√≥n. llevo varios a√±os utiliz√°ndola.
horrible and near useless. often doesn't sync properly with online version, customers and invoices disappear, crashes often. basically... find another solution because this one will only drive you insane.
can't do my expenses on the app. i've started using quickbooks a few months ago. all was going ok but now i can't do my expenses on my app anymore. can't take pictures of my receipts to add them to my expenses. i contacted them and they said they are dealing with it but still no luck after a few weeks waiting. very frustrating. all other functions are working fine though. depe
program not working. i pay itunes for subscription. i pay directly to them and my program is not accessible to me because it says is expired. i make a case with them 1 mouth ago. create another case 2 days ago. and still i am not able to use the program. payed buy me 2 times (direct to them and itunes). do not use this program you will regret like me.
wow, did this app save our business. we are in florida and have had no power or internet for over one week. this app saved our real estate rental business. everything you can do on your desktop, you can do with your ipad, using this app. all customer data is stored on the cloud. this app is mandatory if you get hit by a disaster!
quickbooks on the go!!!!. i love the program and app. i find that it's easier through the app since i can just take the photo right from my phone. i recommend this for anyone!!!!
1 step forward  2 steps back. for the most part, the app functions correctly after finally resolving the issues with accepting credit cards. now, it wants to download the company information each morning. it is doing it on all the devices and accounts that our company uses. it's very frustrating when we need to quickly pull up a customers information only to be forced to wait for it to redownload all the info. hurry up and wait
glitchy and they keep raising prices. constantly crashing, both the ios app and the mac version. and they just raised the price to $60month. not worth it.
do not sign up using the app. signing up from the app store restricts how you can use quickbooks online. you will not be able to change basic setting like email address or password. sign up from a desktop. then you can login to the app later.
owner eleganttouchlimos llc. the best off best. quick book i ben used last 4 years the make my busnise everything easy. invoice custumer and recipts i like it thank you so much. good job
great app!!. this is a fine app, help me to run my business on the go.
meh, no project profitability reports in the app. as a construction business all our accounting revolves around p&l reports per project. the onlinedesktop app gives us the project report but the app does not, which makes the app pretty much useless. our best solution is to login to our qbo account through safari on the phone to see the real time project profitability, shouldn‚Äôt the app do that?
cbcllc. love it just need to add a little more of access on ipad and mobile device. love to have a check signature
love it!. best app for my business!
quickbooks. this app is excellent and the version on my computer is even better save's me hours when quoting well worth the money and it's also good for on site reference
not ready. app keeps crashing, features aren't loading... ever. balance sheet, profit loss... they error every time. hasn't worked once. app is not ready for release.
retired. this new online version is the best so far. user friendly, everything you want to know is right in front of you when you sign in. easy to navigate
"ongoing ipad issues. there has been a problem with the touch id feature for several months now. when you try to access the help feature a page opens that says ""file not found"". the only option is to call support and wait for an available tech. when i finally connected with a tech he said his information says nothing about touch id. this appears to be a mysterious option."
useless software. quickbooks is slow, has errors and the support is probably the worst i have ever had to use. we had an issue where we could not roster our staff for over a week due to a quickbooks error and every interaction with their support team has been horrible. the api to payroll is slow and buggy and they keep upping the prices. use another service!
it works well. only thing i didn't like and don't like about other great apps is the persistent pop ups asking for a review. i get it and all but people will review if they want to. great app though does everything i want it to and more. highly recommend to everyone out there.
works well but need enhancements. the app works well and easy to use. i will appreciate if it can be enhanced to accommodate advance payments and accruals
worse than useless. i downloaded this app as use quickbooks daily, the pc software is great! the apple app is such a waste of time, i can‚Äôt access any reports and the info it does show me is a waste of my time just a load of numbers that don‚Äôt mean anything. no thought has gone into this app i suspect it‚Äôs just a tick box exercise creating an app...
works great for me!. this app is very convenient and easy to use. my business is not complex so it handles all of my needs quite nicely.
almost perfect. just missing two things, send invoices by text, fax, edit or view notes online
still unresolved issues 3 month later. i‚Äôve had quickbooks for over 3 month now and since i‚Äôve had it i have been unable to allocate my bank transactions on my app. i‚Äôve flagged this to quickbooks and had responses but no fix. keep being told to use desktop version for now! 3 months and still not fixed isn‚Äôt good enough for a payed for app.
excellent program. üëç
falta uma agenda. deveria ter um relat√≥rio, ou layout, que apresente as receitas e despesas de uma determinada data.
easy to use. a simple easy app that keeps everything in one place
used to love it. it used to work great, but now it crashes and never loads. wished it worked. i like the ability to snap pics of my receipts.
brilliant!. easy to use, matches payments received and ties them off with your invoices, easy to see profit and expenses for each month. well worth the monthly payment, my books have never been so easy to keep!
"finally. my clients can take pictures of their cash receipts and upload so i don't have to worry about an audit. i'm a qbo certified user so ""i"" know how to use it, but it's friendly enough that they can too. thanks."
good app. very detailed , im no pro @ accounting but i am teaching myself this app. its very in depth and i like it.
very beneficial app. this is a very beneficial app. it does not replace the pc version but is an excellent aid. it's helpful to send invoices on the go or at the end of a service call. the sooner the customer pays the more chance you will get paid. as long as you keep things simple it is a very good aid!
it's glitchy!. although it fulfills the need of having the ability to create estimates on the spot and resend invoices quickly, it has glitches which are frustrating. on occasion it stalls and goes out of the app requiring you to log on several times and even restart your phone before be able to access the app.
app needs major work. the app is useless, i have to pull out my laptop or wait till i get to my home or office. i would love to use my ipad pro, that i carry everywhere but the app is literally useless!!! please fix asap
need to see register. touch enabled but still wants me to login with password. disappointed.
help. there doesn't seem to be a way to tie in purchases on to a invoice to charge specific customers. when you call in for help with the app, customer service does not have access to see what you're looking at.
brilliant app with loads of features!. so easy to use. so easy to learn. instant bank feeds. invite your accountant & bookkeeper & other users. so much support from intuit & the australian team. what's not to like? intuit have put together a great product for the small to medium business owner. thoroughly recommend this product.
good app. this app is a good. we like it on ipad and iphone too. thanks qb!
great app when it works.... after update to ios 13 as well as the latest version of the qbo app, i cannot access supplier information. on top of that, i am unable to save expenses that i am trying to enter too. there goes the productivity. qbo team really need to be better at this!
new update horrible. it's always been glitch but since the new update i can't add products to the estimate and customer service is clue less in how to resolve the issue.
unable to access my account. this app does not work. i am unable to access my account it just goes back to the splash screen.
great but wish they‚Äôd bring back custom fields. the thing that set qbs apart was the ability to have custom fields and filter reports by them. the off the shelf fields aren‚Äôt enough for businesses that are highly specialized. custom memorizable fields and reports should be included in the online version but there‚Äôs only 3 of them and they are limited.
review this, quickbooks. i was using the app on my ipad, and kept getting a notice to ‚Äòsubmit a review‚Äô. only choice was ‚Äò not now ‚Äò . after every transaction, after every page change, the message came up to ‚Äòsubmit a review‚Äô i pay a monthly subscription, stop bugging me. here‚Äôs your review.
refund made impossible. i‚Äôve been making payment on this stupid app not using it at all. there‚Äôs no easy way to refund or unsubscribe this stupid app. who do i bring the attention to since quickbook site says they have nothing to do with the billing and subscription?
over promised, under delivered. the desktop app is slow and the mobile app is lacking pretty important features. their tech support is horrible and can take days to resolve an issue....if they even admit that there is an issue.
ties well to qbo. the app is very easy to use. you can adjust invoices easily and take payments within an invoice. it ties to quick books online very well. i wish it was easier to take payments outside of invoices, but i guess that's what the gopayment app is for. but that app doesn't automatically import the inventory items i'm tracking in qbo so there's no perfect solution.
it only took intuit 10 years to get it right. finally! a cross platform that works where i do and i don't have to re enter all my data. however the search feature has gone rouge. i want to look at the last 30 days but it crashes every time. yes i have uninstalled ect. poor continuity.
so easy!. this made things so much easier. my clients are happy with the line itemization. detailed descriptions. doesn't get much better than this.
bookkeeping on the go. i own a small tax and accounting firm and this app has done wonders for customer service! being able to give my clients real time information from anywhere at anytime is a huge plus! i only wish this app would allow me to process ach and credit card payments on the fly!
awesome app!. i love this app. the ability to check the status of an invoice or review an expense on the go is amazing.
great app. i have no complaints.
like the app but need update for iphone 6 plus. app and software work well for my business but i was disappointed that the app on a iphone 6 plus is just magnified from the 5s. i really hoped it was a scaled ipad experience. really... no landscape mode?
great app, very useful and always improving!. this app is the greatest tool in our businesses ability to streamline work, easy to use.
figuring qb. been using this version ( the only one i ever used) for over 2 years. it seem to get better and continue improving. i still feel frustrated at times about a certain feature but whenever i need support it's available.
does not work after update. tech support recommended i get a android. claims apple is the problem.
can't create new invoice. very troublesome considering this was an app i raved to people about its efficiency yet now i can't even create a new invoice and earn money... just paid for premium too. very disappointed and would like my money back for each day the app is rendered useless.
cannot find anything useful in the app. how do i display a report of unpaid bills? far too limited to be of any use.
great but wip. better than the competition and best customer service in the space! well worth it.
app keeps crashing. please fix your app... i pay a lot of money a month for your service and this app is terrible. for the most part i have to log into the online service to do any work. please fix your app
major flaw  can't run payroll or attached from dropbox. 3 stars as you are unable to run payrol on the go or even view payroll  employees wages which is a major part of this app that is missing. also when uploading attachments you can attached anything other than a photo. no links to dropbox etc which again is a major flaw
quickbooks mobile app crashes continuously, unusable. the quickbooks mobile app crashes continuously and is totally unusable in it‚Äôs current condition on ipad. frustrating and we are planning to switch accounting app companies, after years with quickbooks program. intuit seems unconcerned with fixing the problem that has been plaguing our recordkeeping for weeks now.
meh. so slow loading new pages invoice templates are ugly hard to view invoice view doesn‚Äôt quite seem ‚Äúgoogle‚Äù more like a government website that got a makeover
app keeps crashing. keeps saying the session is over when i sign in and logs me out
user friendly but not without fault. works nicely. has a few issues, but overall gets the job done.
trina gordon (happee momentz). great app! my business couldn‚Äôt function without it!
not accurate. even after the most recent update the app still dose not accurately reflect my qbo account. all information on vended and clients are not up to date. this had been an ongoing issue for more than a year now. i keep hoping with every update this will be correct, but nothing yet.
nice, but naughty. i am writing this review at christmas, that explains the headline :) this app used to be awesome. now i get a lot of can not connect to data or can not refresh data even after multiple refreshes. hope they fix it
very unstable!. downloaded the new version but the app consistently crashes just after login. real shoddy development and testing by intuit.
inferior to qb online on desktop. qb app on ipad or android does not not have even half of the features that qb online has on a desktop. i can manage basic invoicing, basic expenses, see transactions, and pull up basic reports... everything about this app is basic. i have to actually be on my desktop to access the full features of qb online. very dissapointed.
the best app out there by far. the app is excellent for anyone on the go. easy to upload info from the app. user friendly. tried a few other book keeping apps and found this to be the best by far. gets even better every download. 1 issue(for me) is that i can't attach a pdf to invoices using a device. would be 5‚≠êÔ∏è if the next update includes this.
thanks for adding sales receipt. and specially when integrate the go payment charge option into this app. it will be nice to include the sales recite transaction in the reports and not only invoices. also in the notes section to add integration with dropbox and g drive, now only have photo option
fix finally now i can get back to work.. this version fixed the errors from the last update. glad it working again. quickbooks has been good except the last update. this one fixed the issue. we us this app for our onsite business and it's great. several times i would send an invoice to the customer when i'm leaving their home and before i get to the next job it's already paid.
perfect for running small businesses, but...... everything you need to run a small business...but $35 is way to expensive, shouldn't cost more than $25! i‚Äôm very happy with the software and with a few dedicated hours i learned how to use it inside and out.
love it. well i love this app. i never thought bookkeeping could be this fun and easy. thanks for making the program
quickbooks a real sage beater!. having been a sage customer for over 15 years i wish i had discovered quick books sooner, why did i spend all that money on yearly updates when i didn‚Äôt need too. i absolutely would recommend quickbooks to everyone and i do! thanks for a great product guys üëçüèª
"issues. it was working fine on my ipad up until last week. then starting bugging. not all customer transaction appear on the mobile app. called customer service about it. they told me that they were ""working on it"". we shall see. i pay for it monthly...i asked if i still had to pay this month even though it's not working as advertised...answer was yes. not happy with that answer. i will keep you posted. bob"
password paste does not work. i use a pw management tool and can no longer paste it into the app. this is really annoying as my password is totally random and 15 characters long!!!
does not work. app does not work. wish it did, but it does not. none of my vendor activity shows up, profit and loss does not scroll past first page. better no app at all than one that does not work.
update eliminated fingerprint sign in. still buggy. latest update made it to where i have to sign in every time.... set fingerprint but still makes me sign in every time. as per usual it's buggy and says it doesn't save when it actually does. not auto save on desktop so if you get a phone call etc it signs you out of the online site...... super fun to lose a few hours worth of work...
invoice reminder from app. i was hoping to manage my quickbooks account on my ipad like how i use qkb on a laptop, but it seems like on the ipad version it‚Äôs missing a lot functionalities, such as invoice reminder to client. also to set up the invoice reminder. can you please improve this in your next update? thanks.
i love it easy to use !!!!. easy to use and easy to navigate!!!
reduced feature set. previous version:the feature set of the web based app is not matched. (previous mentioned currency and time records). update: removed a lot of preexisting functionality and did not add any missing functions. much worse than before. cannot find a list of invoices due to a supplier. clicking on a particular supplier brings up only the address particulars.
doesn‚Äôt work with ios13. pls fix
best accounting online software. very useful very easy and flexible
happy customer. iv been with quick books for a couple of months now. i run a plumbing and heating company, and this has definitely helped to keep on top of ins and outs of the business. would certainly recommend!
wow! loving the switch!. it's more than i had ever expected. using square or other solutions or good old fashion checks in the mail are nothing compared to how seamless qbo has made my life. that mac app, ipad app, iphone app and even the apple watch app give me the pulse on our company that i've needed for so long. can't wait to grow into more solutions with qbo!
owner. love the app. makes running my business so easy. i would give it five stars except once i was using the app and the system was down for little while. made me feel a little uneasy
offres aux nouveaux clients. je suis client depuis le d√©but nous avons eu beaucoup de probl√®mes au lancement, le support √©tait moyen... aujourd'hui il y a beaucoup d'offres pour les nouveaux clients mais rien pour les clients fid√®les. et une fois en place... impossible ou presque de partir et d'exporter ses donn√©es pour un logiciel sans abonnement. le produit est d√©sormais fonctionnel et agr√©able mais cher pour une petite compagnie.
love it, but. i love the app, but different devices have different functions. some things i have to do on the laptop. the internet version will crash and i have to reload it. not sure if its my internet connection or not. it is helping me get more organized and ready for 041516, ugh!
quickbooks = easy bookkeepping. love the mobile app, very easy to use. access accounts from anywhere, raise invoices, pay invoices. simplified bookkeeping!!
useful but slow. quickbooks online in general is useful for sending out invoices and estimates on the go, going through expenses, etc... however the platform can be fairly slow and sometimes glitchy.
stopping subscription. originally a useful app, but keeps crashing following the most recent update on 27.09. will have to stop subscription and find something that works, so whats the point in updating the app if you lose customers?
worst thing i‚Äôve ever used.. can i give this no stars, it is awful, as others have said awful support, i‚Äôm not vat registered but after an update my account changed so it started calculating vat now left with a massive bill for the accountant to fix all the entries. my advise avoid like the plague, wouldn‚Äôt touch this app with a 20m barge pole, it‚Äôs the worst app and worst support i‚Äôve ever seen.
quickbooks is genius. i don't normally write reviews for apps. but quickbooks online is simply amazing. i've been using it for over a year and i absolutely love it. i can download transactions from the bank so no boring data entry and can create invoices on the go on my phone. so good.
does it. this software is what i was looking for, easy to use, available online, 24 hours a day, no matter where i am.
latest update is garbage. update: 1620 still a garbage app even after multiple emails back and forth with quickbooks development team and now it‚Äôs been weeks since i heard from them the app still don‚Äôt work even after new updates app has been great up until 3 weeks ago now it no longer works! crashes every time i try to open the app.
app is glitching. ever since the new update to the quickbooks mobile app, it has been glitching every time i try to open the app. every time i click the app it closes by itself. it's frustrating whenever i have to log anything in the app. i have to constantly delete the app and reinstall it for it to work properly again.
thumbs up. great addition to the online software
flawless. first app that i've used that really hasn't had any problems at all. i do most on my computer but this is nice to have in case you're in a jam
ceo. this is a really good app it has help our business in so many ways. it help boost our profit margin we have been able to close deals, and make invoices right on the spot. i recommend this for a lot of different business with quickbooks online.
makes life easy. great app that makes accounting on the fly so simple.
lame. i don't understand how anyone can make an app that isn't fully functional on an ipad.
great tool. awesome app, so far so good
good for the $$$ needs more features. need to be able to write and view purchase orders from the app. also be able to see the cost of inventory items. not just list price
great app would be useful to do bills on it though. reminder email doesn't work on app
quickbooks online. not as user friendly as advertised would like to see customization of invoices a little easier other than that i'm getting to like the program
not reliable. is not reliable. not a replacement for desktop app or web based qb online. different icons, different navigation, missing tools reports and features. data does not reliably import into app from accounts.
this app is harmful. support is useless or you really can‚Äôt recover the emails you sending to the clients with your invoice
waste of time and slow. i didn‚Äôt even get past the registration. the app was soo slow and laggy when i was trying to put my details in i gave up. couldn‚Äôt imagine the amount of time i‚Äôd waste trying to write up quotes or invoices on it. avoid!!!
new update changed invoices. the app shuts down every time i get a signature!!
the best app for small business owners. i own a small business near austin, tx and i used to have to drive home to write up an estimate, but with quickbooks they have truely made it easy and extremely convenient. i highly recommend this app.
powerful, concise and easy to use. i get the information i need immediate, and am able to review, edit and accept transactions quickly and easily. this helps me answer questions on the fly!!
great tool. very useful, and easy to access or use on the road.
kinda cumbersome. this app isn't very intuitive and there are a lot of free apps that do the same thing.
great to use on the go!. love this app. i use it alongside the website, this is on my phone. it's not as easy to navigate around as the website but it's not intended to use totally on its own. i love being able to send invoices whilst doing other things  really helps me to consolidate my time.
another quickbooks app. it gets super frustrating that you guys keep making us download a new app so you can start your reviews over. now your new app doesn‚Äôt recognize my account i have to sign in and out multiple times for it to actually load my data
so efficient. love this software, especially the app!
taking our business to a new level. we have been so happy since we switched to quickbooks online plus! it has allowed us to streamline our invoicing and bookkeeping. our clients love how easy it is to pay invoices online. we love knowing we've received payment for each cleaning performed! qb customer service is excellent.
more reports please. i wish i could see more information in reports, even if they have to be precanned reports. i understand the app is more for onthego, but it would be incredibly useful for me.
perfect for a small consulting firm. this app is everything i need for my consulting firm. easy to use and easy to keep track of expenses on the road. invoicing is a breeze. love the data in the cloud. take a pic and throw away those receipts! works flawlessly between my mac, ipad and iphone. no complaints whatsoever.
still in need of basic functionality. timesheets are a must have feature for the mobile app.
very disappointed.. right now i'm looking for something that can run with my business. looking for more features less bugs and more useful.
poor.. really poor set of options compared to the desktop ‚Äúapp‚Äù.
great as an assistant to the desktop version.. i've found this app to be a great mobile partner to the full desktop (or online) version. there's a couple functions that aren't available in the app but everything you do need is easily available. i can't connect my bank account because my (non us) bank isn't listed but being able to input expenses as they happen is a great way of keeping updated accounts. reconciliation is a breeze afterwards. it's a great app.
instant customer service üëå. great app for small to mid size business. phenomenal integration from windows 10. so far so good. thanks.
good app. no complains
crashes on iphone x. crashing on iphone x
no american express support. we use american express for expenses and we cannot manage these transactions within the app. not even see them. the app tells me to view quickbooks online in a web browser to manage amex transactions. this makes this app very useless.
salvage yard and towing co. we have used quickbooks for so long i remember uploading the first version into my computer with a stack of 5 12 inch floppy discs. this mobile version is the best. i'm able to see what the days totals are as well as adding sales with my iphone or ipad.
very unintuitive. is hard to tell which expenses are finalized which ones aren't. it's just not a very friendly interface.
syncs to everything!!. awesome app. i'm using quickbooks for my personal accounting. saves a ton of time. intuit's phone and online support is terrific as well. couldn't recommend this app highly enough.
same as other free app. wave does the same and it's free... once it's finish my period i am out.
"confusing and cluttered app. i love that nearly all of the features in the desktop app are here in the mobile app. however the interface, especially the home page, is confusing and cluttered. ""company activity"" is a bit useless as the default page. show me the charts of paidunpaid invoices. i think the developers are tasked with including every single feature and that clouds their design judgement. it's not an easy ask but let's make this app more mobile friendly."
top notch. awesome! don't know what i would do without it. i guess put everything on paper lol.
took out deposit option! why?. i can no longer record simple deposits from the mobile app. i‚Äôve been using quickbooks online for over a year now and make use of that functionality weekly. why did they take it away? not every deposit is an invoice payment.
some good points. some frustrating points too. stop logging me out for one. taken a while to get my head around it, invoicing seems to be quite easy now. i'm not impressed that i can't do my payroll from this app, that's frustrating.
very good for any kind of business!. quickbooks is great app for managing the everyday finances. it's very fast to send invoices, with this app all income and expenses are simple and quick.
annoying. i use this app on multiple decides and have to go through a 23 step security process everything i try to log in. which means switching back and forth from email to the app multiple times just to get logged in. appreciate the security but tend to not use the app because it's such a headache. also can't do things like make deposit tickets or print checks from app. very limited usefulness.
bugs!. so many bugs with this! i just rated it before and it‚Äôs popped up again asking me to rate. and i could go into so much more, however i‚Äôm only using this until next year. it‚Äôs shocking. i have just sent 3 invoices, the clients have received them, but they are not showing up in the app.
lots of steps. i like the app but there are lots of steps and it takes me a while. occasionally the transaction doesn't go through. it does update my quickbooks so i like that and it saves my bookkeeper time
thankful. i'm so thankful for quickbooks. i'm still learning a lot about it, but i don't think i would not survive without it. i started a small business 1 yr ago. i love the app! i'm always on the go and can access it from anywhere. highly recommended by us @ the hygienist helper, llc!
not bad. i like it. quickly to make and send invoices. the worst problem is not possible to transfer data. need small improvements ..
works and convenient. easy way to enter sales and expenses. i've had no problems with this app.
qb online. tout ce qu'il faut pour la pme. facilit√©, mobilit√©, flexibilit√©! un support technique accessible, comp√©tent et rapide.
crashes a lot. generally works okay, but crashes a lot on a 256gb ipad pro. you have to continually save your work to keep from losing everything every few minutes.
iphone app switching companies. thank you so much for adding the ability to switch companies without logging out!! more likely to utilize iphone app now on the go üòäüòäüòä
avoid merchant service. avoid at all cost the merchant services. they preapprove you and then hold on your money for a month before forcing you to refund each transaction you processed with them. i had to call 6 times 1 hour each time and it is still not fixed. they are still holding the funds and it‚Äôs been more than a full month. terrible customer service.
not ipad friendly. although the web based system works pretty well from a desktop or laptop it is very unfriendly on the ipad.
spotty & unreliable. i rarely review any apps that i use unless they are particularly great or particularly terrible. in this case, sadly it is the latter. this app doesn't have basic features that should be included, and about half of my invoices i cannot open from the app because apparently it uses some feature in their api that is nonsupported or not working. regardless, if you are looking for a 21stcentury accounting solution and app this is sadly not it at all.
must buy two services. i‚Äôm selfemployed and need to track miles as well as be able to send estimates. with ‚Äúquickbooks selfemployed‚Äù you can track miles but you cannot send estimates. with ‚Äúquickbooks online‚Äù you can send estimates but you cannot track mileage. to me, these things should be doable with the same serviceapp but here they are not. plus, customer service is not educated on their product or helpful.
good unless u need their help. i had a problem as accidentally created 2 companies in the one profile. subscription applied to wrong company and they had no idea how to fix it. the company with all my accounting was cancelled as ‚Äòtrial ended‚Äô but other company with no data was fully subscribed. very frustrating when dealing with idiots in the phone!
still no touch id. i used to think this was a great app, but now with these last 2 updates, i have to constantly uninstall the app and still no touch id. why when something works fine can you not just let it be. please fix back
intuit keeps working it but stumbles on occasion. i've been a qbo user for over 4 years now and run my whole oneman business on it. each app version is a bit better than the last and they do fix bugs when notified. i continue to be happy to see intuit continue to improve the app and the web interface. the blanking of bank account data in the dashboard appears to be fixed in v5.3.
downloading company data 247. when the app works it‚Äôs good and the recent updates have proved helpful. however 9 times out of 10 i am unable to use this app. it is constantly in a state of downloading my company data and while i do this all i can do is wait. very frustrating. as a result i have access qb through chrome on my phone and that has a number of rendering issues.
it‚Äôs 2018. it‚Äôs 2018 and still no turbotax integration or automated receipt scanning integration. you still have to manually enter all of the receipt data. if this is about ‚Äústreamlining‚Äù small business time then make things streamlined. no new advances or major improvements in the past 2 years. im in the market for a new system.
keeps crashing. crashes every time i try to delete an item from an invoice i‚Äôm creating.
good app. nice to have this access on the go. works fine for reviewing status and basic functions.
brutal support and comparability. currently looking for another accounting solution. the intentional limitations and total lack of cooperation with the support team leads me to the opinion that all positive reviews are fake. epic fail intuit.
signature box not wroking. when client tries to sign in box on a credit card transaction with a apple pencil or with finger the box moves around. no signature is captured.
made to measure. this online accounting package fits like a glove. after using the desktop version for some years this is now streets ahead in terms of speed of accessibility, very user friendly with very good visibility of information on the home page and excellent tracking of sending, viewing and tracking emailed invoices. simple excellent for my purpose.
great new app!. ease of use. fluid design. easy to read. easy to use. great for any type of industry
why isn't app as easy to use as actual online. the online version is so much easier to navigate. i don't like that the app and the online version have things in different places. it makes it much harder to locate things. i would rather have one streamlined version to use on all devices.
so far so good.. love the app. i think it's great any time i can give an estimate, invoice on the road. thanks.
can this app dethrone india specific software?. you can not setup this app to use for personal accounting. you can not setup this app for setting up multiple companies. you can not run if your internet connection is not working. so, this app is worth your time and money? you can try without worrying about any payment. so, it‚Äôs very difficult to dethrone india specific accounting software you already use. i have tried. you too can.
great app. love this app
best accounting online software. very useful very easy and flexible
unable to download. it keep saying you already own this app so it will download, but nothing happens
only missing a mileage tracker. i recall i primarily looked into a system for mileage tracking, now months later i‚Äôm hooked but i still don‚Äôt have a solution. the invoicing, banking, etc features are all great! glad i made the investment, just need to find me a mileage tracker. hee hee
convenience is nice. nice to be able to access clients remotely and get most information. would be nice to have full functionality in app. some functions are slow going from screen to screen.
it's ok not super. i'd like to have the ability to creat checklists and forms that aren't effectively invoice like. i also don't like intuit screwing with their databases and allowing some invoices and expenses to go missing from my account.
poor customer support. in general the service is good unless you need help ,almost no response from customer service , payroll service is poor .no follow up ,nothing invoice on ipad doesn't accept the customer signature anymore on ios 9 ,no update to be found either no phone number ,end of year will be a good time to switch provider
great app. the most recent updates made this app amazing. it is invaluable in my business. there are still some tweaks to be made but overall i give it 5stars.
great for small startup. just started using the app as the business grows it has been easy to track travel expenses and everything else we need to keep growing.
terrible app. half the time i can not download my banking info, i can not do invoices. it‚Äôs junk for what you have to pay for it. i‚Äôm finding something new.
google signin never works. i have tried and tried to get into the quickbooks app using the google signin. i get it to work maybe 1 out of every 50 times i try to login. i don't know why they haven't fixed this issue yet. i always end up logging in on my mobile browser instead. fail
great can scan bills directly with phone. i use phone app instead of pc sometimes, as i can record bill right when i make purchase, complete with scan on receipt. awesome.
so easy. this app is user friendly and intuitive. i like being able to see the reports and add attachments to expenses. highly recommended for small businesses owners.
three years using qbo. very dissatisfied.. bugs and more bugs. slow and clunky functionality. bait and switch pricing. no way to communicate effectively with qbo as they are pro forma all about feedback and customer service however the poor souls tasked with providing it have no two way communication with the people who actually code this bug ridden system. i am actively looking for other solutions that provide ipad and iphone data entry.
so messy and confusing.. iphone app is so messy and confusing. desktop version struggles so much to gather my company info, and there really isn't much. errors out all the time.
awful, just awful. doesn't even show taxes or vat, you have to log on with a desktop browser for that. wish i‚Äôd signed up for another accounting app.
garbage. this app is junk!! support for this app is useless looks like i will be going back to freshbooks, it may not be a accounting solution but at least it works and i can import my info without manually entering. my business doesn't have time for me to spend hours with support when i need to be taking care of my customers ms support
cool app. i would have given it 5 stars, but it just doesn't have the power that i'm used to with the real quickbooks, but it's ease of use and functionality is still great for a new app.
app issue. i've been using the quickbooks app for over 6 months and it worked fine. now, for the past week the app will not let me access my company data or the data is incorrect after multiple reinstalls. this is very aggravating and qb's customer support stated it's an ios issue. please correct this issue asap. thank you
discontinued...... of course vie been using this app for over a year now and has been super handy. lately been having issues so i called qb only to be told it's discontinued now. wonderful.
quickbooks renew account??. renewed my subscription for a year and i'm still locked out, every time i log in it keeps telling me to subscribe for 1 month i tried to go that way and it asked if i wanted to change my current year subscription? makes no sense.. wish some (tech support or program owner) fixes it i'm about to cancel it all..... wy small business owner
very good and getting better!. qbo has been a great addition to our company and has many great features over qb desktop. there are some bugs to work out but i'm very happy so far with the online application.
great app but....:.. good application but we need features that enable generation of reports
prettt good. it‚Äôs a good app, i‚Äôd have given it 5 stars but the sequential number doesn‚Äôt load when using the app. this means to produce an invoice you have to go back and look up the last invoice number.
terrible. this app has so many problems. it will freeze up and the only way to fix it is to delete he app and download it again. i wii ok old not recommend.
ipad perfect until ios 8.5. app hasn't worked since 8.5 update. have sent several request about the app crashing and no one has gotten back to me. i've deleted and redone loaded, rebooted ipad, etc. when not crashing it's a 5 star app. please fix asap!
super functional..extremely helpful. quick books app is fantastic! makes using my phone for invoicing and estimates very easy! recommend to anyone..... no glitches, no hang ups..... you won't be disappointed!
easy to use and great features. i moved to quickbooks after trying xero, and find it at least as good for my needs and much better value. good foreign currency support, which is important for me.
meh.... still can‚Äôt accept checks as payment in conjunction with payment services on mobile app. lots of glitches...
great app, easy to use. love being able to manage my business on the go. could use more features, but it's still a great app and quickbooks is always updating it. :)
still needs delayed charges. if you can add delayed charges to the available transactions, it will be perfect.
amazing app!!. our business reconciliation just became simplified. easy to use and online access allows us to work on the go. highly recommend if you wish to save time.
mr smith. electrical contractor. early days yet but feels great especially linking bank to invoices and been able to see exactly what is going on in my business. so far a big thumbs up .
app notifications. app has issues which never get fixed. always receive a bug upon opening, can‚Äôt connect to bank account until refreshed, deleted invoices won‚Äôt delete, i no longer receive notifications when customers make payments. tried reinstalling, nothing works. how do i get this corrected?
no more receipts in my pocket. shoot the receipt and record the transaction, now even more quickly with touchid
not an intuitive product. i'm very disappointed with this product. i've used quickbooks on my laptop for two years as well as the gopayment app. this has been extremely frustrating to setup and use for both my accountant and myself.
need better multicurrency functionality. ... an ok app to review transactions and do some basic entries.
updated review. try going to help & feedback and click refresh data. this may solve the receipts not savingsyncing on mobile issue and for touch id and pin sign on, go to settings and switch to on. not sure if the setting stays on once you actually shut down the app.
hot garbage. latest update to this piece of garbage app requires you to log in every single time. pathetic these guys can‚Äôt get it right. update 020219; still has constant logout problems after all these years. would give 0 stars if i could.
ipad trouble. i‚Äôve been using the self employed app for almost two years. i had some issues with crossover between a new mac and my iphone. though a painful process, tech support eventually fixed it. now after downloading the app on ipad, the app won‚Äôt work on the ipad. says mobile access isn‚Äôt available. well what have i been doing on my phone for two years then?
very user friendly!. quick books makes life simple!
great. great app, great software all around for my small business!
app constantly glitches and it's very slow. i've had so many issues with this app. lately it has been extremely slow, it randomly shuts down for no reason in the middle of inputting a transaction and it won't load larger invoices. i'm very disappointed as i use this on a daily basis for my business.
clumsy, slow, crashes often. not a great app, times out saving transactions, sometimes saves them, sometimes not. not worth the money
expiring sessions suck. it's a great app and i'm using it all the time but the expiring sessions are infuriating. if you let us use touch id or a pin, don't make our session expire and force us to use our password! it completely defeats the purpose of pintouch id. it doesn't increase security, it's just super annoying. no other app that utilizes touch id does that  not even my banking apps.
best mobile accounting app. great improvements in the latest version. easily the best ipadiphone app for accounting, that sits well alongside the full featured qbo software.
easy to use. excellent app. very straight forward to use. the only issue i have is not been able to raise purchase orders on the app. this is very important to me because of the nature of my business, other than that it's spot on.
update needed asap. i also have been using this app for years (it‚Äôs great when working properly) but something happened after this last update and i‚Äôm getting kicked off and signed out in the middle of my invoices and estimates. it‚Äôs staying ‚Äúan important update is required‚Äù or something like that and i‚Äôll go to update the app but it‚Äôs already updated! and i‚Äôll log back into the app and get kicked off again with the same message.....
notes problem. customer notes in mobile app do not sync to customer notes in web version.
meh.... looks great, but has so few features that's it's just not that useful.
worst customer support of all time. some of their custom support reps are amazing. some don‚Äôt even know their own policies. i‚Äôve had several different issues with them with several different companies and aspects of their platform and i‚Äôll never use them again and recommend anyone to check other accounting softwares out before going to quick books as future risk and frustration mitigation.
upholstery shop. very good app
very useful application. it really helps me stay up to the minute with my business goings on.
qb makes me look good. qb app is fantastic. i can write and present an estimate right at the job site or give my customer an invoice, or accept payment. in brief....it makes me look good!
great app. i using this app for my business is so easy the handle it thank you guys for this great app
life easier. i resisted quickbooks since the first time i used it years ago and it just didn't work for me. but now it's really easy to use except for a few things that the accountant will fix
excellent interface and convenient app. this app is a life saver and helps me run my small business affairs smoothly. i can submit my invoices and estimates on the go with ease. definitely a must app to have.
pretty useless. can't mark an expense as billable therefore can't create invoices by automatically including up billed expenses can't record deposits can't view downloaded trans action useless
great app!. so easy to use, really makes a difference to be able to invoice and do payments on the move.
lacking several important fixes. initially the app was incredible... unfortunately after an update on my ipad, the ability to email my invoices got much more difficult, no longer populates my contacts, have to manually enter every time, it doesn't store or remember emails. i get connection lost or you are not connected to the internet error messages constantly. spoken with customer care who said i should enter them manually.... really? thousands of email addresses, maybe you should fix your glitches!
mileage tracking not working. the app works well except for mileage tracking
app has gone downhill since update. youve just done an update and hardly anything works. buttons are unresponsive and crashes! sort it out
easy. great app that is so simple to navigate, and dead easy for business novices. well designed.
suits me. so easy to use, perfect for my tiny business. don't need accounting skills the workflow has been designed very well and support is great.
literally crashes every time i try to enter a sale.. great for tracking expenses but useless for processing and tracking sales. very disappointed.
quickbooks online. i really like the app, but it is very pricey.
crashes. won't open. immediately crashes. please fix
a pretty good app. all in all, this is a pretty great app. it does just about everything i need it to while on the go, but it is missing one key piece of functionality. it does not allow the recording of deposits and that is really important for me. other than that it functions flawlessly and has never given me any trouble. overall, i love it!
very nice!. i love have this power in my phone! i can email invoices or print them out, all on my phone! this app is easy to learn and soooooo fast when you get used to it. there was a lot of thinking when they designed this app, wow
great tool. this app helps me keep track of my business finances and at the click of a button i can see who owes me money or who i owe money to. really useful!!
accept button doesn‚Äôt work.. love the app however this latest update the accept button doesn‚Äôt seem to work so you can‚Äôt accept the new line items from your bank feed.
beware price increases.. i love the functionality, but i've had two price increases since becoming a subscriber to the online service. the entire point of a subscription model is so that the company has a sustained income in order to continue developing and my costs stay fixed every month. this isn't acceptable so i'll be looking for other solutions soon.
effective. efficient. essential.. began using quickbooks at my brothers recommendation. it unified our estimating and invoicing process and surpassed expectations with all the numerous functions. it will quickly becoming your single source accounting software. to add on to this review qb has become vital to our growth and receivables are paid timely. we have recently switched from square to using qbo's merchant services and have had a seamless process. fincite group
did update have had issues ever since. cannot download all of he files needed keep getting error code 10000. no resolution
aaaamazing. i run a mobile and in home boutique and this app has been a life saver! i'm so happy with it!
damn that update!!. quickbooks is great. we've transitioned over from sage and it is so much quicker and easier. estimating and invoicing a breeze. but..... ever since the last update, it makes you sign in to your account everytime you open the app which is incredibly frustrating as it takes some time to load your company info etc. usually, touch id and you're in and ready to go. please please please sort this out asap and you'll be perfect again!
"fees on fees. while the app itself works and is fairly handy, i strongly advise against quickbooks as a company. i signed on as a business owner for $6.95 a month and was immediately slapped with over $100 in fees hidden in ""fine print"". worse is the utter inability to get any customer support from intuit. i canceled my subscription and despite already paying for the month, lost access immediately and lost all of my records. then i got billed again. stay away."
"needs splitscreen support. how can this app have as many revisions that its had since ios 9 came out and still not have split view with other apps?? also the glitch is back that when you hit the ""back"" button when viewing a customer it takes you all the way to the top of your customer list instead of going back to where you were. frustrating..."
lots of scope. i went to one line so i can update through the day rather than spending all evening doing paperwork. our broadband is very slow which is very annoying & qb2013 pro was far easier to use. i've only been using it for a few months & definitely found many advantages as well as some disappointments, but, it is being updated regularly. i'm optimistic that i & the program will improve
excellent once setup. i run my whole business on quickbooks. it was a little tricky to set up initially but once my bookkeeper had given it the once over, everything was perfect. great stock management system that ties in to the invoices and hooks in with the business bank account. this makes self assessments etc very easy and saves loads of time. very happy :)
latest update issue. the latest update does not allow you to create a sales receipt, estimate, invoice, etc., from the customer, you need to go to the home screen to work around it. this is better than the last time this happened (within the last several months) at which point there was no work around. at least we can process cards for now...
worst update yet. just deleted. crashed. didn‚Äôt update banking. five star to one in a flash.
broken. the last update broke the app. various error messages. can‚Äôt safe expenses anymore. errors include asking to chose a template before saving expenses etc. bad woek
crashes. crashes immediately after i open the application. update was recently done and now i can't use it.
love it!. quick books merging your gmail contacts and being able to add and subtract expenses lays your invoices out really well and makes everything so easy! clients get all the information this way and it leaves them without surprises. because of the convenience it forces me and reminds me to enter all the information that i would otherwise forget to include.
crash. won't open since last fix. please fix again.
still needs work. this is a good general product, but many basic things are still missing. it is significantly better than the last time i tried qbo.
"awesome apptool. although i rate it 5 star, there's much improvement that can be made on creating ""invoices"" definitely needs more options and versatility. needs more custom ability in modifying the invoice into something fitting to each customer. overall, keep up the great work and adding new custom features."
very efficient. very efficient app, very handy
app. using this app is like being your own accountant. it helps keep track of your income and expenses. i highly recommend to all self employed people.
hands down makes your business easier!. i've used qb for years. and and i've come and go thinking i'll find something easier. today's version of qb particularly with the mobile app hands down makes it so easy for me to track everything i do in my business. worth every penny you spend ... and oh ya ... it's a write off!
convenient. i upgraded to quickbooks online after some computer problems. it is so comforting to know i can access my information from several devices and the transition went smoothly.
mobile app. not happy. i am on the phone with support everyday. won't print on app or on chrome. they don't know what to do. this mobile is worthless to me. i don't have time for this!
good, but needs to get better. quickbooks online is a welcome change from the shackles of the desktop version, but there are still key features and functionality missing (in the app as well as in the browser) to really make this useful. like.... being able to manually adjust the amount of sales tax on a general journal entry.
since ios 13 update not full screen. can believe this is the 5th update si ce then, and you can‚Äôt fix on iphone 11 pro full screen notch lack, we pay a lot monthly for this crap, so frustrating
it's great. enjoy this app
loads of bugs since updating to ios 13. broken links. can‚Äôt call up customer information. dashboard only shows banking information. invoices and estimates haven‚Äôt saved when generated on mobile device.
great mobile app, but it has a mind of its own. i've found the ability to work remotely as a great plus for estimates, electronic invoices and checking customer records. i have just had issues with downloaded deposit amounts and matching for reconciliation. automatic entry into register has to go!
glitchy and horrible, like everything intuit makes. i'm a quickbooks proadvisor and have worked with quickbooks for several years with many companies. my advice to businesses and individuals is always the same start looking for something better, it's out there. intuit has horrible customer care and constant software issues that make simple tasks very tedious.
adding a photo to a receipt should be simple. apparently there was a recent update that removed the add photo option to tranasactions. it's not there any longer. i called support and they tell me i have to create a note, add the photo to that note, then go find the transaction and add the note to it.

best for small businesses on the go. i'm a cpa consultant that specializes in accounting systems and qb and its other products qbo are the most popular in our vancouver market. it's popular simple to use, has good built in reporting, and lots of apps. and it's adaptable for virtually all small businesses.
it's about time!. quickbooks online and the cloud sync apps for iphone and ipad is nothing short of amazing...it's about time and wow they did such an amazing job with the whole experience. i love that i can make a receipt for a customer on the spot on my iohone or ipad.
great app. i don't understand what some people are complaining about it. this app works great. thank you
best way to keep track of your expenses. i love this it works very well a little hard to learn but very simple to use what you learn how to do it i use it to track all my business expenses and it works perfectly i love the touch id lot it keeps everything very secure you cannot go wrong with this i absolutely recommend it for small business owners and businesses in general
pretty complete finance from your phone. i'm not too sure about the need for a separate app for payroll, but this does work as advertised for the most part.
scott. i find the app to be a great addition to the desktop version. having access to all invoices and customers through my phone is excellent.
love it!. simplifies life. amazing phone support. always improving.
mr. the problem with quick books on line is that you can't choose what account a payment is credited to when using an ipad or iphone. it automatically placed it in to an undeposited account and then you have to log on to quick books using a pc and transfer it over to the desired account. for example current account. basically you do the work twice and defeats the option of doing accounts on the go.
why bother. why bother with the app? you get better features by using your web browser, even on your tablet. even still, the payroll functions are very cumbersome and don't work well, so a desktop is still required.
needs improvement. with every update the app gets worse and worse. not mention the desktop online even worse the ios app
down graded. from april this app is unusable. i down graded to qb online. it appears it was released about a year too soon. nothing but frustration from day one. the phone app is all but useless.
weak iphone app, no customer service. really weak app, no customer service. after trying to contact qb customer service, i got no response from anybody at qb. after paying big monthly fees $ i'm switching back to invoice2go, where i got great customer service and my feedbacks were used in improvements.
crashes when downloading. crashes when downloading after initial setup. have not been able to use app. disappointing.
quickbooks saves me time & money. this app has streamlined my business as i am always on the go. its easy, efficient and powerful! still missing critical features in international version such as online paypal payments
quickbooks online not working. i paid my subscription thru itunes, got charged but haven‚Äôt been able to use it.... it keep giving me a message to subscribe which i already did. contacted apple, itunes, and intuit quickbooks and haven gotten anywhere... frustrating!!!
unwanted changes. we pay for the service, yet intuit dictates changes to our invoices that have doubled our paper use as well as anger our customers. you make the changes without any notice or options to do otherwise. nasty, mean dictatorial behavior!
awful. iphone app pretty much unusable in the real world. always wants to be signed in each time you open it, touch id feature doesn't work. today it's complaining the app needs to be updated before i use it, it then directs me to the app store where it shows i already have the latest version!
wow!. really cool app! it's linked on all my device! i can make invoices on my phone and send it to my clients directly from email! cool stuff!
disappointed. i‚Äôve been using the phone app for a year now. when the app works it is fine however it constantly freezes and my only option is to restart my phone. i have deleted and downloaded the app several times but it has not fixed the issues.
pretty great app. i've been using the app for 4 months now. it's great if you're a small business owner that wants to be able to pull reports on the go without having to carry your laptop around. touch id support was a great addition
worthless. i have never once been able to generate a p&l for a board meeting. the reporting function just does not work, which is the most useful part of accessing this program through a browser. also, even though i can enter a sales receipt, doing deposits from the + does not work and i am unable to make corrections that are relatively simple from the browser. this platform provides no service at all.
subscription bug driving me crazy!. for the last few weeks the quickbooks app has been unusable! it alerts me that my subscription has expired and will lock me out of any activities. i have been on the phone with tech support, my subscription is up to date, it gets fixed for a day and then the problem re emerges the next day. this is an excellent app when this problem does not exist. i use a fully updated ipad pro. please fix this bug!
good features and functionality. lots of functionality right from your phone. i like the fingerprint signin when resuming the app. would be good to see a save as pdf feature on invoices and quotes. i'd like to be able to upload them to the cloud from my phone or attachment them to an existing email i am writing rather than having to email separately.
game changer. been using the desktop version for over a decade. now that i‚Äôm using qbo along with the mobile app i feel like i have been living in the dark ages! this is simple, useful, powerful and most importantly convenient! no more keeping up with paper receipts and forgetting to keep track of purchases.
awesome app!. really useful app!!!
very limited functionality. the app has very limited functionality  i can‚Äôt even see the purchase ledger on the app never mind post invoices or take photos of them. lists supplier contact information only, not even account balances. useless. i have to log on to full site and try to navigate around it on phone screen which is difficult. oh and by the way, very unhelpful customer service too!
worthless!. until this app can sync with the desktop version of quickbooks, it is worthless to my business. i'm sorry i downloaded it. but i have already deleted it.
everything i need. the quickbooks app has met every one of my needs for my small handyman business. i love the ability to email customers estimates, invoices, and sales receipts while i am standing there with them. i have only been using the app for a little over a month but i feel good about my decision to go with quickbooks online.
great when it works. it's great when it works, but lately i can't login or save changes. constantly states that i'm not connected to the internet. the whole reason i made the switch to online so i can do invoices on the go. what's my $30+ a month going to?!!
great app. i haven't subscribe fully but am definitely paying for this...
needs a delete feature.. so i downloaded this for my business and decided to do a sample invoice and payment to and from myself. however i cannot delete this. i tested to make sure i could use this effectively before switching to it. without the delete invoice or payment option i am out of luck.
love!!. the quickbooks app is absolutely perfect! when handling business on the go and clients are making payments, i can easily create an invoice andor sales receipt. makes my job easier. it tracks all of our business expenses, profits and losses. this is great!
user role permission not supported. custom user role not supported on ipad. quickbooks recommends you to use online but the invoice interface is ‚Äúblowout from screen‚Äù in chrome and safari and no available signature from customer. its annoying to use it online. this happens, at least, when the user have custom role, just permission for sales for instance.
"problems. this app will not let me save an invoice, it always says ""this number already exists"" no matter which number i add. only started the error on the 301112, please fix."
crashes 48 times per day. app crashes over and over, saying you need to log in again for critical updates. there are no updates availability, and deleting and reinstalling the app doesn‚Äôt help. it‚Äôs frustrating because it takes 20 minutes to enter customer information, because you need to finish and hit that save button before the next crash. best to just use quickbooks in the browser, even though that isn‚Äôt perfect. four stars with no crashes.
"about 710. not bad but not good. the app keeps requiring updates if used on apple products. not an issue but the updates never appear. quickbooks blames apple and apple blame quickbooks. we ""updated to the cloud version"" from a pcm based quickbooks. so far we are very very disappointed."
love it. love it. the version on my computer is great. this app is a little unintuitive but if you understand what you're doing it's not bad!
great app for business.. a ++ must have app
great app!. wonderful app.
great for invoices on the go. being able to do estimates and have it linked with the office is great.
perfect for a small consulting firm. this app is everything i need for my consulting firm. easy to use and easy to keep track of expenses on the road. invoicing is a breeze. love the data in the cloud. take a pic and throw away those receipts! works flawlessly between my mac, ipad and iphone. no complaints whatsoever.
love qb online. i love everything about it. my favorite features are the qb app and being able to process bids and invoices from my phone! and being able to accept online payments thru the invoicing feature is awesome too.
great software. few issues lots of results this product is easy to use and reduces time spent in the office its mobility is my favorite part use with my phone tablet laptop and desk top devices payment network nice but a little pricey
can‚Äôt enter, view or edit bills. this app would be great, except you can‚Äôt enter or edit bills. workaround would be to login to website, but then what‚Äôs the point of having the app.. just use the website for full functionality
great. great app does everything it says it will
so easy to use. quickbooks is simple to understand and has everything a business needs with easy access from any device. i love how simple it is to use and also can rest knowing there is help on the phone 'talking to someone in australia' if and when it's needed. it covers everything a business needs to run successfully. i wouldn't use anything else for my small business
app has gone downhill since update. youve just done an update and hardly anything works. buttons are unresponsive and crashes! sort it out
too much missing. the app could be useful, but is a pain. does not have an option to add bills, which is most of what i want to use it for. constantly asks for password rather than touch id, making it a pain to use, or worse  encourages you to use a simple password. hopefully both will get fixed soon.
excellent. great mobile app from intuit, quickbooks online is great and although a bit different from the desktop version it has improved the way i work with my clients
excellent app. superb app living my life by it now couldn't recommend enough
great app. i don't understand what some people are complaining about it. this app works great. thank you
not working. app will not open on iphone 6 plus
brilliant. used other software apps before now and this one knocks socks off them, can access all my account details and add bills and send invoices so much easier during the day now, knocks about 30minutes a night off my admin
not all of the features of quickbooks online. it would be great if this app offered all of the features of quickbooks online but it doesn't. what it does do is give a one way look into your quickbooks file. i'll just login from a browser.
still needs some changes. great program when it connects and saves correctly. constantly crashes or cannot save work. you have to close app retry. most of the time loosing the invoice or quote you've created. needs addressing. this happens all the time on ipad app.
time saver!. we recently had a glitch with the program in that our quotes and invoices weren't displaying correctly if sent from a tablet. qbo support walked us through the problem and made the changes to the backend templates until it was rectified. invoicing and quoting should never be a burden. we are happy with the outcome.
keeps crashing. i absolutely love this app...but since ios 13 install every time i go to use it, it crashes. i sent an email to support but need this rectified. once that glitch is fixed it‚Äôs a 4.5 star app!
fantastic app for my ipad pro!. i recently acquired an ipad pro to use for my business and instantly downloaded quickbooks to use on the go. this app has been wonderful for sending invoices, logging my expenses, and managing the books in general. so far, i have yet to experience a crash and everything has been working well for my needs!
app not working since update. normally i'd give the app 45 stars but every time i log in now it says sign in successful but there is no online account associated with the email and to start a free trial. however when i login from safari, i get in no problem. please fix as i am unable to access data from my phone.
excellent app!. anything that can please my accountant and help me stay organised gets my vote!
pretty good when it works. very helpful when it works. very useless when it crashes and won't stay running.
sign in issue. great app, except the need to confirm with text or email every time upon sign in!! would have rated higher with out this issue. very frustrating
great app!. super convenient to track all my business transactions on the go. recent updates have made it much easier and more features are accessible.
bravo !. bravo pour cette application intuitive, simple et efficace. il manque quelques fonctions pr√©sentes sur la version web et bien utiles, comme la recherche sur les champs sp√©cifiques  personnalisables par exemple mais j‚Äôimagine que cela viendra dans les prochaines versions. f√©licitations aux d√©veloppeurs pour ce beau travail !
latest update issues. the newest update won't allow invoices or payments to save and touch id doesn't work. doesn't anyone test their product before release, very inconvenient.
awesome app!. this is a smooth and seamless app that allows me to access all of my company needs wherever i am. invoicing in particular is easy, efficient, and professional!
doesn‚Äôt load (for me). app doesn‚Äôt load. tap on the icon and nothing happens. i hope no one else has this problem.
downloading company data 247. when the app works it‚Äôs good and the recent updates have proved helpful. however 9 times out of 10 i am unable to use this app. it is constantly in a state of downloading my company data and while i do this all i can do is wait. very frustrating. as a result i have access qb through chrome on my phone and that has a number of rendering issues.
bad update. i was having trouble with the mileage tracker and now with the update i can‚Äôt even check the settings. please fix this. i am paying for this service to help run my business. this isn‚Äôt a free game app.
incomplete. the mobile app is not very useful compared to the online version, missing so many functions! like time sheets and billing be with them!
meh. dislike so many things about the app and online version. i would really like the ability to browse through invoices for ex. look at invoice #1 click next to see #2 and next to see #3 and the. be able to reverse this. unfortunaly this can't be done and one has to search specifically for an invoice by number.
user friendly but. this program is extremely user friendly and makes book keeping easy for small business owners but the cost of doing payroll for employees is extremely expensive. i have 5 employees and it costs way to much for me to use quickbooks üëé
best in the business!. im a general contractor, tracking and allocating expenses is easy, i take a picture of the receipts with my phone and stays stored in the cloud, really cool. i like it a lot
it's not your own accountant.... and it's not supposed to be. it does what i want and need it to do to help me run my small business. combined with qb online, pos and gopayment i'm easily managing things while on the go. thanks intuit!
great app!. great app for small medium enterprises
love it!!!. this app makes things so easy to keep track of a job while in the field and saves time. love it!!!!
great program. i find myself keeping better records. very user friendly. great program
changes are not good. unable to email with attachments. the older app will not work.
best app for my business!. not a good app when it doesn't download your banking, nor did it make good invoicesestimates. i love invoicesasap, but this app needs help.
can't take payments in the app.. new app is working great, but i would love to be able to take a customers payment within this app instead of having to go back and forth between gopayment and quickbooks apps. one of these days. one of see days.
could be great. this app takes care of basic needs but it could be amazing. i'm unsure of why intuit chose to cut the corners it did. examples: there is no check option in the + there is no bank deposit option in the + tapping my bank acct on the home page takes me to my chart of accounts. huh? there needs to be some polishing.
very good app. good
stable. no longer crashes. the first update into ios 10.0.2 was really bad. wouldn't load. this update fixes that issue and i'm back working. was a setback for a week as i do a lot of invoice updates through the app, but i made due.
perfect app for consulting. fantastic app! highly recommended. very easy to use with ability to track invoices  it's perfect for my consulting business.
you need to purchase one per company. if you own multiple companies this software may not work for you. unless you rather pay double and in my case triple for each software per company. highly disappointed and no one that would solve it. regretfully invested.
app crashes. this app crashes or cannot save my data on every entry i make. horrible app!!
app doesn't connect on ios 9. ever since ios upgrade 9.3 and quickbooks mobile app doesn't sign in, always says check internet connection. it's a bug in the app and they know it, we contacted support to fix it and they said they are working on it and will have a solution by end of may. this problem has been on for more than 4 weeks with no solution. poor app with poor support. not recommended at all.
best app for my business!. not a good app when it doesn't download your banking, nor did it make good invoicesestimates. i love invoicesasap, but this app needs help.
don‚Äôt bother downloading!. this app was so hard to use, wouldn‚Äôt connect to my bank, wasted so much time trying. brought up all of my personal accounts transactions even though i asked it to hide them. wouldn‚Äôt bring up transactions older than 3 months. i honestly don‚Äôt understand how anyone can use it!!!
the app used to work?. why do companies change apps from functional to crash is beyond me?
feedback. the app would be better if you were able to enter bills not just expenses. very annoying to have to also use my desktop computer to finish my book work.
i love it my business run a lot smoother!!!. our customers are loving our new system
more functional than i expected. i generally consider the ipad mainly for viewing...not doing. that said i have been pleasantly surprised by what i can actually do in qb for ipad. i don't think i'll only use ipad but for beautiful reporting and basic functionality, i'm impressed so far.
well done.. on my wish list is an interface to my phone contact list and a direct link to paypal.
lacking. app is seriously lacking in functionality. don‚Äôt buy quickbooks online unless you plan to do most of your work from a desktop. kind of defeats the purpose. way overpriced and they keep raising the price too :( wish i had stuck with the quickbooks pro platform.
great app. great but fix the unicode and sync problems. and please add more functions
update ruined app. crashes constantly and that when you can get in. half the time it‚Äôs ‚Äòdownloading company data‚Äô and won‚Äôt let you do anything. i find this making it actually harder to run my business.
garbage. total trash from the moment of sign up. every single step has been brutal, customer service is non existent and now we have to file dispute through our bank because intuit refuses to cooperate or help with anything. do not use this service. i see them bankrupt within the next few years. customers make the business and they do not care about their customers.
junk  plagued with issues. this is is great when it works, but is plagued with bugs. as of recently it logs me out to ‚Äúrefresh,‚Äù then when i log back it it tells me the account doesn‚Äôt exist. i fix this i have to delete the app and reinstall it, every, single, time. and their customer service is terrible. they never have any solutions.
helpful app. so far very satisfied with this app. able to record expenses and deposits on the go and quickly. less time spent doing tedious book work. two thumbs up! 
excellent invoice and stock update tool. this is so much more convenient than other accounting tool or software. i was able to send bills sitting in a remote destination and also input product purchase and services as and when the job was getting done. there is no time waisted by yourself as well as customers waiting for billing. excellent product.
best business app. quickbooks has definitely made running my business much more efficient and has made it easier to close on deals. the estimate tool makes it easy to send professional looking estimates to clients, and with a click, those estimates turn into invoices. you can receive payments through quickbooks as well. add the payroll service and you can run the whole business yourself. i would definitely recommend this to any new business start up.
not free. wish there was an app like this for free the soon i started free trial next step was if i wanted 3months and pay or have a small discount and still pay :
disaster. was forced to use qb online due to always changing fees for desktop version. always crashes. hard to use. terrible. wish i could use another program.
qb ol user. i almost can't believe they actually released this to the public. it is only half an accounting system. all you can do is see outstanding invoices. it is at best a limited reporting system. it is not a way to control a business.. a long way to go before even thinking about paying $0.99 for it ..
sales tax calculation is wrong. when creating an invoice, the app does not honor customer's sales tax setting. it applies tax even on customers with tax turned off. please fix asap!!!!
buggy. app has been very buggy. for a few months i lost the ability to add expenses and not every time i click on home the app closes. using brand new iphone 7.
efficient app. as a bookkeeper i use qbo for all of my clients as well as for my personal account. it just keeps getting better and better. accepting transactions is a breeze as is setting up invoices, paying bills, and writing estimates. one feature my clients find helpful is the receipt attachment. i would highly recommend this app for anyone who uses qbo.
crashes every time. when app is installed i can log in to my account. then the app says ¬´ downloading data ¬ª and when download is complete it crashes. if i open it again (so still logged in), i cant even get past the launch screen.
missing the ability to record bills in app. really can't believe they missed the opportunity to take photos of invoices we receive using the ipad. apart from that it's a excellent app
simple, yet capable. does everything i need and i love being able to use it online, iphone and ipad. on the go flexibility is a must and this app does that flawlessly!
paypal integration very poor. quickbooks say it integrates with paypal and automatically downloads transactions. well, it does partly, but doesn't download into expenses the transaction fees with paypal here, meaning you have to do it manually. it will do it for an online purchase to the same account so why it doesn't work properly is a complete mystery and one support do not help with.
terrible product. if you are looking for comprehensive business software that is easy to use and reliable, you won't find it with quickbooks online. after using the desktop versions for years, the online version is just a sad attempt. i had high hopes when i started using the online version. within minutes, i was disappointed.
clunky and awkward. app can be awkward to navigate.
awesome app. helps with all business expenses and just great interface
not that good. only useful if you want to look something up quick as it is missing tons of features from the desktop site. will be using it no problem for a few minutes then it will log me out and ask for my password all over again.
not bad. pretty nice app. went from desktop manufacturing to quickbooks online. i like having access to my books while at craft fairs and being able to use different devices. still needs some work  it's been weeks and my gopayment account is still not linked and now find out the online doesn't acceptrecognize the chip reader. square app is more robust and may use that instead. also would be helpful to have a mileage tracker.
don‚Äôt use this with an ipad.. bought this app and was unable to get it to work with an ipad. 4 hours on the phone with this company and still no success. they charged me and told me to get my money back through apple. there is an open known problem being worked on their end but user‚Äôs beware. you won‚Äôt find out until you‚Äôve paid.
must have app for any business!. easy, fast, comprehensive and dependable. makes the handling of my business a breeze.
great but could use a little more. overall pretty great. clean easy to do basic tasks, would love access to a few more advanced features...but overall it's a great app. the app is stable, love the fingerpint login (even though it's still a little buggy at time of writing the review), it's clean & easy to read, good navigation. overall i'm very happy with it!
crashes since ios13. i can no longer open my quickbooks on my phone since the ios 13 update has been released.
do not buy. while i think this could be a good product, the app ruins it. i have both the base and the arm. the app crashes every time i use them. at times it takes 3 tries to get them to finish reading. terrible product!
love it!!!. app is easy to use and saves me so time! wish i did it a long time ago!
fix finally now i can get back to work.. this version fixed the errors from the last update. glad it working again. quickbooks has been good except the last update. this one fixed the issue. we us this app for our onsite business and it's great. several times i would send an invoice to the customer when i'm leaving their home and before i get to the next job it's already paid.
great flexibility. love being able to do estimates and invoices on the go.
keeps crashing. i can't do anything with the app. every time i try to open it, it closes out about 5 seconds later. worked great until the last update.
awesome!. i have always enjoyed using quickbooks. over the years i have moved from quickbooks to quickbookspro to quickbooks enterprise and now quickbooks online. this online system is awesome. if integrates well with other systems i use, it‚Äôs easy to navigate (once you take the free courses), customer service is excellent when i have issues  and it will move straight into my turbotax corporate filings. love, love, love it!
what a waste. after trying for over an hour to get pass login , it tells me that i don‚Äôt have any services. wasted my time. i‚Äôll just use the android version.
could be better. it's good for entering payments, that's about it. and even that is a stretch because half the time it shows invoices are unpaid in the app while the desktop accurately shows the same invoices as paid.
decent....but needs work. the mobile app is laid out decent and does work well for the most part. biggest problem i have is you cannot access product quantities or make any purchase orders with the mobile app. need to fix that.
disappointing absences. so disappointing that i cannot see qty on hand on the app. also, limited reporting on app!
"bad idea. i downloaded to approve parole only to find i need a second app for that. two out of three ""recognized"" transactions are inaccurate. back to my mac for qb. ugly app guys. sorry..."
crashes when downloading. crashes when downloading after initial setup. have not been able to use app. disappointing.
app. best account app
app doesn't show anything. the app version does not match the online quickbooks. most of the information is not accessible in the app.
2x features missing from making this 5 stars.... 1: ability to do ‚Äòpurchase orders‚Äô in expenses 2: ‚Äòvoid‚Äô sales invoices
horrible. constant crashes at the worst of times!!! aarrrggghhhh!
easy to work with. loving it
not impressed with this software. i am not able to add my bank account.
ipad app. please update your app to be more like the desktop version...i can not track inventory received through the ipad app i purchased and ipad pro hoping to do away with my laptop and so far its been seamless, except for this app not being able to track inventory received. i hope your developers can figure this out before my 8 year old laptop crashes! thanks
disjointed. nearly everything i do with this app requires amending in qbo. paying an invoice always pays money in to undeposited funds instead of my business account. when adding an expense it only offers 3 payment options and doesn't pull down the options from your own account. it would be great to see these creases ironed out so that something done on the app doesn't have to be corrected online.
best app for start up company. hands down this app is the best for any size company, once its all set and customized to your company you & your employees will operate more efficiently. take your time to learn it don't be afraid to call customer service they are very friendly and helpful.
payroll missing. the app is great for invoicing, receipts etc however it lacks the ability to do payroll which becomes a hassle for what i need it for.
it's scam don't download 19.99 per month they took from my account. i just did download almost 8 month ago this app they took from my account almost 19.99 per month after cancel also they are robbing very bad don't download at all even no customer service to help you to talk also bad bad super bad
great app. very happy with the app so far. there is a couple thing that would be nice to be able to do from my i pad and not have to go to my computer hopefully in the next update they will.
a small business must have. i have used quickbooks pro for my small company for many years, but i can't believe i have gotten this far without this app.
amazing app!!. our business reconciliation just became simplified. easy to use and online access allows us to work on the go. highly recommend if you wish to save time.
love this app!!. i love how easy to use this app is but my only problem is that i can't sync it with my company's ocbc account and my shopify's store's inventory.
great. good app...need to be able to accept credit card or debit..i'm sure u guys are working on it
great for contractors. on the go app that helps with contracts and invoices . i can use ipad or even phone to show my clients and get approval and signature for new contracts . just what i was looking for
great & uptodate!. this is a great little app to give you access into the back end of your quickbooks online account. great for doing simple invoicing and adding expenses. i still use the desktop browser for more complicated reports and such. well done and intuit keeps the app up to date thank you!
brilliant!. after years of using outdated and under performing sage software, finally i can use a truly mobile cloud based app that fulfils all the needs of a small business. come change of tax year make the switch, it's easy and you will wish you had done it years ago.
when it works. i rely heavily on the quickbooks mobile app. when it works, it works great. but every once in a while, it goes down, for days.
can't login in app. why can't login in app?!
"getting there. qb online is a great service, but slightly glitchy. the app however just gives me an error message when i tap ""banking"". that's the most important feature!!!"
enables my business.... ...to run smooth and accurately from monthtomonth, yeartoyear. managing multiple clients and accounts would be a nightmare without quickbooks.
stopped working after the update. this was working great until the software update last week. now i end up creating multiple copies of invoices and estimates and the app just freezes on the saving screen. i can only finish off by logging in through a web browser and completing the task. please fix this fast intuit!
love it. amazing i don't know what i would do without this app.
can‚Äôt subscribe after trial period. it‚Äôs a good quickbooks version but i started trial period made a profile and invoices but the app won‚Äôt let me renew subscription the buy now button doesn‚Äôt work when clicked on. now i may have to start another profile and lose everything?
amazing. so simple to use makes my life a lot easier as everything can be done literally within minutes
amazing that i can make invoices and take payments literally anywhere with cell service.. i think it's an amazing app. the only downfall is i can't add invoices from vendors that i haven't paid yet. only expenses that are already paid. hence the 4 stars. if they had that feature it would be a five star for sure.
great app. first time running a business and this is everything i need i love it
typical intuit product. buggy, not awesome user experience. slow, lots of errors, doesn't work most of the time and no support. use freshbooks or something else if you care about running a business.
awesome. it saves me so much time. great to keep up with my business accounting. mostly simple to use. some features require a bit of basic accounting knowledge.
so easy. this app is user friendly and intuitive. i like being able to see the reports and add attachments to expenses. highly recommended for small businesses owners.
great app. so easy a caveman can do it
works great!. for an app this is very powerful and lets you know the basics on the run.
great app. good for a non accounting person like me. i can keep track and give it all to my accountant and it gets done. i love that i can send invoices from my ipad and enter info etc. two thumbs up!
simple and easy. great for keeping tabs on your business on the go but would love to have the actual versus budget comparison on the dashboard instead of having to bring up a report.
aes. great app, worth the investment

useless since update. the last update brings a gorgeous splash screen. i know this because i see it dozens of times each day since i have to log in every time i open the app! completely useless now.
convenience. i really love the convenience and accessibility of this app and quickbooks online. since switching from desktop pro to this i've been able to keep up with paperwork in the field. i think it's great. i just wish they made an upgrade so i could automatically subtract expenses from specific jobs. having everything separate is a real hassle.
best business finance management app period!. bombdiggity
brilliant but.... ... i‚Äôd like to be able to schedule invoices to be sent out on later dates and set up automatic recurring invoices as i supply weekly subscribed services to my clients.
not sure yet. too early to rate this app. only second time me using it. ill check back in a couple of months with a more thought out opinion.
not working with ios13.0. not able to click on customers, create new estimates or invoices. tried reinstalling. still no luck.
accepting transactions is huge. staying on top of qb transactions is always tough. now i can accept anytime i have a few minutes and it isn't a big event. the result is having a more real time and dependable p&l. this is a great app finally. keep the updates coming.
great app.. wonderful!
great app. coming from using xero for my accounting software, i can say this app and platform as a whole is far more superior. i would recommend to anyone to switch to quickbooks.
great until update. all good until the update. now inputting new customers or suppliers is very slow (that's probably an understatement). hopefully going to rectify this as i'm still paying every month.
doesn‚Äôt keep track of suppliers. this app works fine as long as you only want to send novices. unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt tell what you owe your suppliers and allow you to pay their bills, so while you are running around invoicing clients the suppliers will be sending the bailiffs round to your office.
can't even login. useless program  i can only use web browser to access, app is not working at all
limited features in the app. the app has extremely limited features as compared to web cant send customer statements or edit recurring transactions or match partially paid invoices.
decent product, ux needs some work. ux needs improvement
i rely on online sync with my external banks. i'm disappointed the subscription i pay for is not mobile. i imagine it would take a lot of programming to include sync on mobile tablets but if it's already hosted on the server, why no access? i'm not a architect but i imagine outsourcing the sync hardware off the tablet you could get your current transactions on mobile . maybe i'm crazy
perfect for construction guys. i'm always running from job to job and the mobility to give estimates and invoice is on the spot is priceless... plus the customizable terms for each buildercustomer with the added alerts helps me stay on top of receivables
opens the closes. after the last update of quick books i can not access it on my ipad. there for it is costing me money. i hit the app it opens the closes right back. i have uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it is the same thing. i have 3 jobs i did today that i could not take payment on because of this. please fix asap
app is satisfactory  quickbooks online is not. i am very unhappy with quickbooks online. if you are anything more then a landlord of one rental property, then you will find quickbooks online to be greatly underwhelming. it is clunky, glitchy, and virtually void of any mechanism for customizing the program. it is not a replacement for quickbooks desktop. perhaps after a few years of unfortunate beta testers abandoning quickbooks online it will get better. for now, though, don't do it.
great mobile app, but it has a mind of its own. i've found the ability to work remotely as a great plus for estimates, electronic invoices and checking customer records. i have just had issues with downloaded deposit amounts and matching for reconciliation. automatic entry into register has to go!
crashes. the app just crashes as soon as it starts to load. don't waste your time downloading it.
"latest upgrade is a disgrace. i have never written a negative review of an upgrade, but the latest version of this app made a great app totally useless. you can no longer receive invoices or reconcile bank balances. do yourself a favor and delete the quickbooks app rather than ""upgrade."" the mobile website is more useful than the app."
ios 13 crash. an awful app that is made even less useful in ios13 because it just crashes straight after running.
awesome. looking forward to seeing what's next!. there's times when i get fuel and the gas pump printer is out of paper. i pull out my phone, snap a picture of the purchase and expense it. brilliant. i would like to itouch login option. it's not to cool punching in your password while shivering. thanks qbo.
seems great so far. this is what i've been waiting for so i can invoice my jobs right on the spot. a few months on and yup this app is amazing works perfectly for what i need.
well made basic accounting. quickbooks online has been extremely useful. i have a small contracting business, and i can record an expense in seconds, photo the receipt, create an invoice or estimate, and email these to customers. syncs instantly and automatically across multiple devices, so it's on my phone, tablet and online. the cost is tiny, and it takes care of itself  no more shoebox!
latest update not working?. can't save payments or invoices now? kind of a critical thing for doing books on the go...
great. amazing app but whoever did that last update screw it all up. can save estimate or invoices. horrible. i hope they refund at least a month of fees because i'm loosing money having to do all my estimatesinvoices at my house instead. needs to be fixed asap.
signed up with incorrect email... how can i reset password without the right email?. email error
excellent. quickbooks online has created a whole new dimension to bookkeeping and accounting for small business. the ipad app is very useful for an overview of transactions
no more receipts in my pocket. shoot the receipt and record the transaction, now even more quickly with touchid
not very good. there seems to be issues here. a lot of errors with login on this updated app. as well as having to wait so long for funds to be deposited. not happy
"not useful at all. disappointing that it comes with the name ""quickbooks"" yet it doesn't actually allow you to really do that much. you can't run reports, check accounts, etc."
qbo. quick books online is a great app. the ability to have access to business data at all times is not only critical but essential for any business.
q books extremely disappointing. very poor, i‚Äôm trying to use it on ipad, very frustrated. would not recommend
one word. awesome. i love this cause i can store all the receipt online.
generally does not work. if they generally updated everything they might needful go back a step or two. won't even open on the ipad anymore. crashes immediately.
low rating until the app supports chart of accounts. the app continues to be under developed for functions that are developed in the web interface. the app is excellent for invoices and credit card transactions if you have a merchant account coupled to your qbo account. the camera can be used in app to document your receipts to the cloud and i use it extensively for hotelairfarerental car expenses and they can be attached to invoices when emailing your customers.
easy. great app just what i need as a digital nomad.
previous desktop user. as a desktop user of quickbooks for over 20 years, i am not impressed and very disappointed in the online version. i was forced to switch because unbeknownst to me until it happened, the desktop version only allows a certain number of customers (both active and inactive count). if you reach the limit you are forced to the online version which cannot come close to comparison to the desktop versions. would never recommend quickbooks.
good. i use quick books all the time on my ipad or iphone. my business is mobile and i'm hardly ever in the office. just wish they would start being able to accept visamaster card payments soon. this would help a lot! other than that, the program is really easy to use and the interface is really simple, which is great!
movement through fields. i love the app but it takes so much more time than through safari, enter or tab should move through fields looking forward to this fix
useless app. used to a quickbooks user a couple of years ago, and it was ok then, but now i have recently returned and find it rubbish. a simple thing like adding a company address is turning out to be an impossible task. total waste of my time. it you are a small business using the app via iphone or ipad forget it. stay away
love it. i love this app, just doing what i want
"pure garbage. i've had several issues with accessing features and each time their ""solution"" was to create a new account and start over because they couldn't fix it. and now they are raising the monthly price, yet again. i'm done with qb online. seriously, save your money and use the desktop version with your own remote access."
does not have all features as online version. it's great for making invoices and receiving payment, but that's about it. i created a refund for a client the other day and could not even see it when i went looking for it on the app. good, but needs improvement.
longtime user, app is gradually slowing down. been using quickbooks online since it came out, and unfortunately the apps seem to slowing down more and more with each update. i have to delete and reinstall the app a couple times a year because it hangs or acts funky. hope these little issues get resolved and i can use the apps i pay a lot of money each year to use
qb online. i switched to qb online because i needed the mobility so i can write invoices from my smartphone while on the go. my old desktop version was so much easier to use and navigate through than the online version. in my opinion the online version is far less professional and versatile. i guess i‚Äôm stuck here though as the desktop version doesn‚Äôt work while i‚Äôm traveling.
great app for the ipad. great app for the ipad and small buisness
love it!. use it everyday. thank you qbo for making me more productive
demoted from 5 stars to 4. using the app on ipad and iphone for more than 5 years. dashboard has been unable to properly show invoice status for at least 3 months now. version 17.9, at least 3 updates ago? no fix yet nor response from intuit after feedback. while i‚Äôm not fond of frequent updates, one expects to have these kinds of obvious bugs fixed in the next update.
nice app that works well!!. works well, well thought out and presented. helps me day to day for sure!!

all but useless. i love qbo but the app is useless. it‚Äôs like a completely separate universe where nothing shows up as set up in qbo. reports are limited and custom reports aren‚Äôt there. i can‚Äôt see something basic like checkbook register.
excellent app. great app
useless. i am an avid qbo for ie customer for many years, but this ipad app is useless. can't do anything with it, and can not see banking info, the most important thing in accounting! if you want to view customervendor names that can be done, but you can't work in this app. view only.
negative stars  if possible. i find it amazing intuit promotes such an obvious clunker. why don't they just buy square and tie that in  or at least imitate it. intuit is lost when it comes to transactional businesses. at any rate  as almost all users point out here  this app is useless and should be an embarrassment to intuits development team.
waiting for updates. quite frankly, it's been totally useless. the app does not sync new data entries with the online database. i've already spent well over three hours with multiple customer support reps. the idea of creating invoices is great....only problem....it does not work!!!
great app if it worked.. this app was really promising at first, but now it seems like i consistently have issues with chase bank accounts and american express accounts updating. it‚Äôs monday and sine thursday my alchase accounts say they are updated when they are not and my amex continuously has error connections. and then u call customer service and they ask you if you called amex to see why there was a connection problem. a shame.
total crap. this app doesn't work. it shows numbers which doesn't make sense, you can't rely on it. i just go to safari web and login to my quick books account. please change it if you can.
incredibly glitchy. the app is glitchy despite updates. i‚Äôm not super impressed by intuit in general. i use their payroll for my business, a lot of glitches there too. app crashes or spontaneously exits my selections to ‚Äúaccept‚Äù for no reason and i have to start over. does not learn well, i have to reteach things over and over.
new update changed invoices. with the most recent update it has the changed the format of the invoices that are printed. prior to the update the internal product name wasn't displayed, now it is. this is not helpful at all, quite inconvenient and time consuming to edit all product names as to not entirely give away the source of our products.
"owner. i've used quickbook's desk top version for years, but went to the online version june 2015. at best, the online version is clumsy and full of frustrating quirks (maybe those ""quirks"" should be called ""bugs""). the only real plus with quicbooks online for me and my small company is being mobile. i'm adding two stars unto my rating for that."
accounting professionals client list incomplete. when logged into the account thru the app, i am unable to view all clients quickbooks accounts.
exporting and texting invoices. anytime i export and try to forward an invoice to a customer with an android it will not send it. iphones are no problem, but androids do not accept it. i have to screenshot it. recommend patch to fix this.
underdeveloped & terrible support. the software is totally undeveloped and does not have the features of the regular desktop version. tech support is horrific, they can't help because they don't have the knowledge. intuit had no business releasing the software to the public it's not even ready for beta yet. the iphone app is worthless!
negative stock entry. i have been using this app from 5 days.. please make a provision of not issuing invoice when the stock is 0.. plus while entering the purchase bill give a column of itemised discount in the items
disappointed. needs touch id for login, and bugs fixed for ios 8.
great program. i love quickbooks. i run payroll and create estimates, invoices and sales receipts. i am able to link all my accounts even my square account easily and seamlessly. the customer service representatives are competent and friendly.
bad update. was close to perfect, or at least practical. since the last update, this app is useless to me. hoping this will change!
highly functional for an app. unlike other folks i find that i can get the majority of what i need to accomplish for daytoday business done on this app. very user friendly.
the software has been a nightmare recently using iphone and ipad keeps saying i haven't paid. i've written to emails and had absolutely no response to either no refunds either because i can't get the software to work unless i'm in mice studios on my laptop which is being fixed currently i won't be with me for the next four weeks so how i'm supposed to do any invoicing i have no idea this is absolutely ridiculous use sage...
great!. the ipad qb app works great! as a plus the support and development people are very respectful and helpful when it comes to suggestions to make the app even better. to be able to be completely mobile for a small business means you can be more efficient and get paid faster. the only thing the app is lacking is signature capture and then it will be everything you need and there will be no need for apps like invoiceasap.
not their best or most usable work. tough to navigate, not intuitive and the online version is aweful
this update is total trash!!!!. errors on just about everything i try to do and things save twice and web pages aren't ready for ipad pro! don't update!!!!!
longtime quickbooks user. always pleased with the updates. best program i've used. very user friendly
excellent app. ease the booking... awesome
"issues. it was working fine on my ipad up until last week. then starting bugging. not all customer transaction appear on the mobile app. called customer service about it. they told me that they were ""working on it"". we shall see. i pay for it monthly...i asked if i still had to pay this month even though it's not working as advertised...answer was yes. not happy with that answer. i will keep you posted. bob"
doesn‚Äôt work. app won‚Äôt open and website is unresponsive. not very impressed with the program.
couldn't ask for more!. everything you need, intuitive and great access with mobile apps! can't believe the value for money!
bank account sync issues. when it properly syncs with your bank account it works great. takes a file for qbo to help with syncing issues.
new update changed invoices. with the most recent update it has the changed the format of the invoices that are printed. prior to the update the internal product name wasn't displayed, now it is. this is not helpful at all, quite inconvenient and time consuming to edit all product names as to not entirely give away the source of our products.
great timesaver. i used the free app and i have made up my mind that i will be purchasing this for my small construction business.
da mogliorare. troppi problemi e troppe differenze con la versione da desktop. non si riesce ad accedere a molte funzioni accessibili da computer ed a fare le personalizzazioni necessarie. da migliorare!
useful app. adds a lot of useful abilities to your mobile device. i'm not a heavy user of it, but i have not had issues with it for months using the basic features.
great. efficient. user friendly.. really enjoying having this app option for my business. absolutely loving quickbooks intuit online!! really like it can upload photos of receipts. my only suggestion would be to allow photos to be upload to an itemized bill. thank you.
so close. please add the ability to create sharable links to invoices from the mobile app. that would be incredible
rates have doubled with no appreciable improvement in the system. now i just tried to use the app on an ipad and i cant even generate a journal entry... grrrrrrrrrrrr!
best app!. best app better then squared
super & excellent apps. very user friendly application . i would recommend this software to other people
great app!. only change would be to allow for a larger job location field. other than that i can honestly say it's helped us tremendously with invoicing.
copy & paste. we are unable to paste anything in quickbooks app if we copy anything from another app
crashes almost immediately. running ios 12 and then 13 on an iphone 8. installed the app. put my login info in. accepted that no problem. then boom. app crashes and i‚Äôm back to my iphone home screen. rebooted my phone. deleted and reinstalled the app. makes no difference. still crashes. having this app was a big factor in my decision to run my business on quickbooks and now i‚Äôm reconsidering that before i get any deeper.
can't live without it. i don't know how i did business before this app. i love that i can access my company books anywhere. i love the way i can take a photo of the receipts for my expenses. thank you qb!
good app. this is excellent for small businesses the only thing i think they should add is a quick way of entering vat on mileage money.
just works. great app! no complaints, but my business isn't very big. looking forward to quickbooks scaling up with me!
i can do all my stuff from my phone!. after working for a customer, i can type up some quick notes, have the customer sign off and take payment before i leave. exactly what i needed!
search. the search feature needs improvement. can only search by customer info. can‚Äôt seem to search for an invoice by keywords that are in the invoice.
app crashes ughhh. app crashes after you sign in. please fix!
needs improvement. i just started using this app while traveling. it doesn‚Äôt compare to the site on my pc. very unfriendly and difficult to impossible to bring up to date.much incomplete data. need to go to work on this one of its to be useful.
great but could make better. it‚Äôs a great product but i would like to be able to view and print my quickbooks invoice through the app. not sure why i can‚Äôt do this ?
quickbooks. works great . happy with the app
great app. yet again another update and even more glitches, you charge a fortune and cannot provide a decent service  i‚Äôm considering switching to a competitor as you have breached the contract that you have with me. this needs fixing urgently and you need to refund subscription fees! my advice to businesses and the selfemployed is do not use quickbooks!
app lacks functionality. info being offered isn't current 2017 information. try looking up purchase orders per vendor and it displays last years (2016) scattered information. not very useful... this app is only good for sales invoices and p&l reports. that's about it. and who's to say that stuff is even current without double checking with the online database from your computer. payments: unreliable looks like i'm sticking with the gopayment app. just another step to my day to day book keeping tasks...
more than convenient, it's necessary. having the app makes it so much easier to do business on the go. you can send estimates and invoices before the client meeting has even ended. efficient and essential!
need a guide. new user here and i need this apps for my business... but i wanna know how to entry my daily sales..
slow and buggy. disappointed in app. doesn't correlate well with desktop version. slow to load information and sometimes won't update accounts.
excelente aplicativo. gostei muito do aplicativo, s√≥ achei a mensalidade um pouco alta, sendo que depois de um ano ela aumenta 100%
perfect for contractors use. we use it for our plumbing company. however it would be really cool if quickbooks could somehow link to contacts so that when return customers call we know who it is.
owner. this application and online service is the best i have ever used. it keeps me up to date with all book keeping. the reports it provide makes doing taxes a synch. the only thing i haven't mastered is tracking all jobs separately. if i can get this program to give me a report identifying what the profit was on each job that would help tremendously. i am fairly a new user about 2 years off and on. other than that, i give this app
nice app... wish it did all i need it to do. i have told people, do not buy an ipad with the intention of running qbo on it, you will be surely disappointed! the app doesn‚Äôt do enough, especially in reports and you can‚Äôt run payroll... and in the browser it‚Äôs terrible.
can‚Äôt imagine life before qbo. seriously, how did business owners manage before qbo? keep up the great work.
please: give us delayed charge already!. how many times do we have to ask? for the love of gawd, why can i not add a delayed charge on the mobile app?????? this is something you actually want to do when you're at a client, not get them to sign for an invoice every time you visit them during the month.
needs improvement. i just started using this app while traveling. it doesn‚Äôt compare to the site on my pc. very unfriendly and difficult to impossible to bring up to date.much incomplete data. need to go to work on this one of its to be useful.
great work!. the app works great and is a very useful tool for on the go business matters. i have not yet figured out how to add single time activities on the app ... not sure this feature is available. but other then that it's great!
not user friendly. it‚Äôs hard to fill all boxes as do on pc. not user friendly. it‚Äôs hard to fill all boxes as do on pc.
new update issues. the previous update solved these issues, but this current update causes error messages with sales rep login whenever creating invoices, and also causes printing communication errors constantly.
great!. this is one of the greatest apps out there. smooth and organized
limited features in the app. the app has extremely limited features as compared to web cant send customer statements or edit recurring transactions or match partially paid invoices.
easy here, hard there. you can tell this is more for business that need to create invoices more than purchase orders. desktop as well. i‚Äôll give 4 stars when they add a po feature to the app.
app does not support multicurrency. it‚Äôs 2018. apps have been around for quite a while now. if your qbo account has multiple currencies enabled, you can‚Äôt use this app for banking. seriously, wtf?
great program. i love quickbooks. i run payroll and create estimates, invoices and sales receipts. i am able to link all my accounts even my square account easily and seamlessly. the customer service representatives are competent and friendly.
nice app. good to run the business with this app
app problems. okay!! so for like 2 years, your app will not configure with the desktop version and none of the email addresses get updated. so in my case, i had been sending invoices to the wrong person and couldn't figure out why i wasn't getting paid? fix this like it used to work 3 years ago
works great, most of the time.. when it works well it is great, and that is most of the time! of course it isn't perfect and hangs up or doesn't update sometimes without explanation or reason. overall worth using though as i do often.
love this app!. fantastic app.
convenient & helpful. as a new business owner and usually overwhelmed with just running the business, the app and website make the financial and tax side of the business easy to stay current and accurate. once i got the initial tax required and payroll payments set up, it's made my life easier.
great program. great program and its user friendly too.
so far so good. really like the new version of quick books. i like the ability to work on invoices while on the phone through the app. has made billing so much easier than the old check system. but even then, when we do get checks, easy to process. only hang up is journal entries. i used to love working of the gl and posting accounts and the online and app version of qb is just not as functional.
why!?!. this app and online program is insanely buggy. every time i try and open the app it takes five or six trys before it loads. once it loads i am satisfied at best with the user experience, but if my internet connection isn't a gig a second the app crashes. i wish i didn't pay for a years worth of service or i would delete it with extreme prejudice.
editing chart of accounts. i love everything except for when i'm editing my chart of accounts. when i go back to upload pics of receipts, fix categories and dates the phone app on iphone crashes. it's been doing it for several months. i have passed on the information, updated my phone, updated the app to no avail. very frustrating as it's an integral part of accounting for my small business.
utter crap. if i could give no stars i would app crashes all the time won't send invoices to customers i have had for years have been struggling on with quickbooks for several years but now can't take the frustration anymore caused by this utter waste of money.
works good. easy to use.. it's really easy to file expenses with this. that's all i really need a mobile accounting app for.
read the fine print and check your bank account. i set up our online account without the payroll. they are charging me for the payroll (i don't have employees) and a level higher than i set up for. now the battle begins. buyer beware.
does not work with ios 13. beware!. crash on launch when using it on ios 13.
keeps crashing. every time i try to upload a receipt from my phone, it crashes when i press save & doesn‚Äôt save at all. i‚Äôve tried closing the app & trying again, but it does it every time, so basically i can‚Äôt take a picture of any receipt & upload it. please fix!
limited, buggy, slow... this a majorly limited version of quickbooks online. you really can't do much with it. it also crashes often and is extremely, painstakingly slow. but so is qb online for that matter.
was great but can't add expense. i used this app all the time yet now i can't add expenses and take a photo of receipt. something has changed help intuit.
many bugs. need to fix bugs that cause the app to not follow the regular online access. employees can see things they shouldn't (like business income) and are unable to do things they should like entering customer info and invoices.
good but could be better. many features that are online, you cannot use in the app. even the online version is limited.
thanks for adding sales receipt. and specially when integrate the go payment charge option into this app. it will be nice to include the sales recite transaction in the reports and not only invoices. also in the notes section to add integration with dropbox and g drive, now only have photo option
"buggy, issues with sync. for some reason this app is constantly having connection issues for me. i get messages like ""transaction not accepted"". then i have to log into the desktop version to actually do the work. ok for a glance but not useful for productivity."
excellent!!!. i just love this app. i has allow me to invoice and collect payment at the point of sale without the paper work fuzz. it has allow me to improve my cash flow while increasing my efficiency while i am in the field. my only regret, i should have implemented much sooner into my mobile service.
quickbooks online app needs lots of work still. the basic problem is it‚Äôs way too slow no matter where i am. usually end up just going through the internet. they are always changing things !üò°
excellent solution. moved from qb desktop longtime user 9+ years this app and the online approach work really well.
does not work. vendors don't display but when you try to add the vendor you can't find it tells you that the vendor already exist. even if account #'s are turned of ipad version still shows them. not worth the frustration!!!!!!!!!!!!
crashes on open. useful app until this update. it crashes on open, both on ipad and iphone. cannot do business this way...
need more work. it‚Äôs ok for beginners they still need to improve it
overall good product. not having access to the entire online tools on the app makes for complicated tasks at times. the online browser does not run fluently with a safari browser so if i need anything beyond basics i need to get to a pc.
how can i subscribe!!!!!. love the app, but when i try to subscribe it is impossible to accomplish! what the heck! can't you make it as simple as a push of a button?
fantastic. it's so handy to have quick books with me wherever i go! i can balance my bank register, create invoices and take payments on the go.
game changer!!!. highly recommend qbo for any business trying to keep up with the cloud. the cloud is the future. for our needs converting to qbo from desktop was the winning choice. qb is constantly improving and it shows. we had a lot of people advising us to dive into the desktop version more but i followed my gut feeling. glad i did. it's my opinion that the desktop will be a dinosaur very soon.
quickbooks is good but‚Ä¶. slight learning curve and seems to have a few annoying bugsquirks.
life saver. apart from the fact i have to input my password every time, this app is a great compliment to the version i use on my laptop. so easy to use, can invoice on the spot. very happy.
great app. the quickbooks application allows me to quickly see my bank accounts, profit and loss statements, balance sheet, invoices etc.
discontinued...... of course vie been using this app for over a year now and has been super handy. lately been having issues so i called qb only to be told it's discontinued now. wonderful.
super efficient. this app has streamlined my workflow 100%
this app needs updated. this version won't work :(. not working reloaded app no go. :(
really needs an easier login. since the last update, logging in is a huge pain. touch id rarely works.fix this.
so so. the app is not the greatest. i've worked with better.
could be better!. need reoccurring billing, invoices need to be more clear after multiple invoices have been sent. it would b a great idea to have some agreement templates.
fantastic for on the go.. customers pay me and i put it right in the app. no waiting until i get home to forget. love this app.
not great for my line of business. doesn‚Äôt aloud me to itemize product with different price for each one of my client
love it. my entire business is conducted through my iphone. thanks qb for making life so easy!!! greatest app for any small business, hands down!!!
great app. it seems to work great! other then it not auto saving when i close the app, that is the only complaint i would have. everything else is awesome!
finally. i can‚Äôt believe it has taken me this long to become this organized with in my business. being able to scan my receipt and toss it in the trash feels amazing. no more consuls full of old receipts.
subpressions. like the mobile app
mobile app for online qbb has problems. today has been particularly difficult when an invoice won't save. quickbooks tells me it is safe in the cloud, but it never is. now i keep getting a message on my ipad that my log in has expired, even though i just logged in. please fix this stuff. quickbooks is great when it works,
well thought out. very user friendly!!. very satisfied.!!üëçüëç
awesome!. fantastic app. as a freelancer i am often away from my office. being able to create estimates and have my clients sign them on the spot has been great. and being able to send invoices from anywhere has absolutely changed my life! love it.
scam!. this app won‚Äôt let you unsubscribe. forgot my password and tried all ways to access my account, but they won‚Äôt send me a verification code in my phone. i have exhausted all efforts to change my password and log in, but to no success. i reached out to their failure of a customer service representative, didn‚Äôt help either! scam!
consistent. consistently bad. just like the qb for mac was unreliable and terrible, and purposely left that way to push customers over to qb online, this is no different. buggy, unreliable software is about the only thing intuit excels at.
useless since update. the last update brings a gorgeous splash screen. i know this because i see it dozens of times each day since i have to log in every time i open the app! completely useless now.
functional. easy. efficient. beautiful.. what more can i say? i am an independent film producer that is often out of the office. i prefer this app to the web version on my laptop. wow! this app alone makes the purchase of my iphone 7plus worth every dime.
awesome. saved me lots of money because i don't have to pay someone to do all of my invoicing and receding from customers. easier than the quick books that you'll pay 300 for
has potential. i'm not i fully understand why quickbooks is the worlds leading software for small business accounting. i'm dying for customizations for my invoices and estimates. these updates should work like a wysiwyg editor; immediate updates. desperately need more room for customizations on the invoices as well; they look like they are from 1995. the mobile app is ok, could be great. some things are not where you expect them to be but i guess i just have to learn that.
great little app. excellent app for basic book keeping invoicing etc and keep up with the book keeping on the fly. but to do the serious stuff you still need to work from a laptop or desktop.
unusable in ios 13. after login, app crashes every time. i tried deleting and reinstalling as well. ios 13.0. please fix asap.
poor service. difficult to set up invoice template and negotiate site, customer service poor, and when you try to write a review and send it off if the nickname is taken you have to write it all out again. as usual well advertised on tv but fails to deliver.
binoy. easy to use interface love the app
amazing. east, fast and quick to learn. highly recommended
app is handy, but buggy. recurring invoices are a wreck. i have had the same issue for 2 years with quickbooks resetting my settings every month and automatically sending invoices to my clients without approval.
getting better but a long way left to go. we switched to quickbooks on the recommendation of a number of accountants. then we realized that quickbooks online and the desktop offering are worlds apart. the app is good, but not great. the entire qbo experience is frustrating and getting support is difficult.
getting better but a long way left to go. we switched to quickbooks on the recommendation of a number of accountants. then we realized that quickbooks online and the desktop offering are worlds apart. the app is good, but not great. the entire qbo experience is frustrating and getting support is difficult.
did you not test the latest update?. crashes on startup... please fix asap. i use this daily. this used to work great.
great app for small business!. i love being able to enter my expenses and invoices from my phone. very convenient and makes tax time much easier!
excellent. does what it says on the tin.. excellent app. works brilliantly on the ipad, sometimes find it a little sluggish on the iphone but i put that down to the poor wifi we sometimes have and bad signal from phone operator. anyways it's so easy to use and i can produce an invoice there and then and email to the client instantly. don't know why i took so long to move from desktop to quickbooks online.
ok software. constant downloading of data and password reauthentication really slows down work. larger your business the longer it takes. you‚Äôd think with sas, would be much better. looking for opportunity to jump off.
good software. this software is very awesome. i work for the company but also use it for my own personal budgeting and it is extremely helpful but there are still a lot of bugs that need to be worked out with this app so that all the information updates correctly.
great app but needs improvement. there are various things you can‚Äôt do on app .example you can‚Äôt set recurring transaction, use batch actions for reminders. for indian users , they have not launched quickbooks payment. there is no customer portal ,there should be system for sending invoice and reminder link via sms overall it is good app and all does the basic stuff but should look forward to integrate above stuff as well
can‚Äôt generate po‚Äôs. 90% of my business is generating and sending po‚Äôs which you can‚Äôt do with this app for some stupid reason. i‚Äôve been requesting the feature for years (which i shouldn‚Äôt have to request) and quickbooks has never responded.
freezes all the time. it will kick me out several times in a session and it freezes up and doesn't save the work that i have done. not very user friendly for newcomers.
cis unfriendly. useless if your a contractor or subcontractor. if your in the construction industry, this app is useless. you cannot create cis invoices which renders this app useless.
does not do simple qb tasks. this app does not have all the functions as the computer online version. i can't run simple reports and the payroll app which is separate does not allow me to make changes to the employee information. doesn't function like you need it to and it put me in a bind when i went out of town with just my ipad. i would not even give it one star. worthless.
not working with ios13.0. not able to click on customers, create new estimates or invoices. tried reinstalling. still no luck.
awesome i just need to learn to use it. its awesome i love it but im new to it so i have a little bit of trouble using some of the features but im sure i will get the hang of it with time n experience
fix it. quit making me sign in again and telling me my session expired.. there are multiple safety factors already in place that should allow me to open my app and go to work
unusable in ios 13. after login, app crashes every time. i tried deleting and reinstalling as well. ios 13.0. please fix asap.
amazing program. this is the best program for your company!
best app for invoicing. hands down the best invoicing app i have found, it was recommended by another business owner and i am very pleased with the purchase.
very nice!. i love have this power in my phone! i can email invoices or print them out, all on my phone! this app is easy to learn and soooooo fast when you get used to it. there was a lot of thinking when they designed this app, wow
very easy to use. kool and easy to use weather n your phone or computer
do not update to ios 13. if you rely on the app, don‚Äôt update to ios 13 until they make it compatible. it crashes on startup after face id.
freezes. freezes when saving a new client. app is useless.
much room for improvement. lack of a solid search function along with slow load times make this an app that leaves a lot to be desired. even the online functionality can use improvement. still a decent system for a small business but hopefully they'll spend some time fixing the app soon.
terrible experience with customer support. we had terrible experience with customer support. for a very important issue we contact qb customer support team, we wait for 6 days an never respond our request. for this incident we can't bill our invoices. we hate our experience. consider customer support if your company needs help.
longtime user, app is gradually slowing down. been using quickbooks online since it came out, and unfortunately the apps seem to slowing down more and more with each update. i have to delete and reinstall the app a couple times a year because it hangs or acts funky. hope these little issues get resolved and i can use the apps i pay a lot of money each year to use
rubbish. doesn't work. need to add bills but can't. how ridiculous to not have this function. deleted. no support from customer service
not working!!!!!. i've had this program for a year and it's not working today!!! i can't accept edit or accept credit card payments.... argh!!
invaluable tool!. qbo app is invaluable for me as a small business owner. having access to all my funicular data, customer records and invoicing is fantastic! the app works flawlessly.
poor service, poor quality product. this product is the worst i have had to deal with. service is non existent, the app is constantly in errors, backing up is slow, the system does manual and not by the operator, everytime the + symbol is used it closes the app. my accountant doesn‚Äôt even like the system. i have loaded, unloaded and reloaded the app so many times it‚Äôs no longer a joke. quick books tells me they fixed the fault, like never.
annoyed again!!. i did the latest update and now i can‚Äôt even open this damm app! terrific ay! any suggestions qb‚Äôs!? can you get this sorted asap. a few updates prior to this lasted one, after that particular update all my company details except my abn disappeared, why? the app didn‚Äôt seem to save my details properly as i added them and it was like that until the following update. then everything was back to normal. pretty annoying!!
lots of errors.. there are a lot of bugs with qbo, and my accountants have noted errors in the reports. apparently qb is aware but haven't resolved the issues. we have also had numerous glitches in the program  including not being able to log into our account (only being able to log into my accountant's page). this issue has been ongoing for over 18 months without resolution. overall qbo has great potential if it only worked properly.
not working. i have been using for years on my pc and ipad. now all of a sudden the mobile app is not working on my ipad. not recognizing my email. spoke to tech support....supposed to be fixed but it‚Äôs not.
getting better and better. the app was mediocre a couple of yard ago but still useful. it's getting more polished and even better now. good app!
jason arnold. so far quickbooks has been great. their program has some flaws i‚Äôm told they are working on. the payroll is very very slow to get up and running. but all i. all it saves me time and money
not functioning. does not function as expected. vendors do not show any activity...
great idea, poor execution.. intuit needs to hire better programmers. if they could just make it possible to see transactions within a report it would be so much better
doesn‚Äôt let you do self assessment tax. this app only does my business tax return, and whilst it doesn‚Äôt explicitly promise more, because it doesn‚Äôt let me do my self assessment (buy to let) it means i still need another app to do this. and an account on top. being such a major tax app, the fact it can‚Äôt deal with all my tax matters is a major fail.
great app. this is getting better with each update it makes. i you this app everyday to run my practice and it makes it very convenient because i'm constantly on the road and i don't have to sit at my desk just to enter expenses or send invoices to clients.
user friendly  no need for anything else. this is an amazing app to use on all devices with my quickbooks online package. managing all aspects of my business from wherever i need it. highly recommended.
could be better. this online app could be a lot better. limited in what it can do, but not bad for the cost
awesome!. fantastic app. as a freelancer i am often away from my office. being able to create estimates and have my clients sign them on the spot has been great. and being able to send invoices from anywhere has absolutely changed my life! love it.
low rating until the app supports chart of accounts. the app continues to be undeveloped for functions that are developed in the web interface. the app is excellent for invoices and credit card transactions if you have a merchant account coupled to your qbo account. the camera can be used in app to document your receipts to the cloud and i use it extensively for hotelairfarerental car expenses and they can be attached to invoices when emailing your customers.
touch id flakey. typically does not prompt for touch id. very inconvenient and indiscreet when working with customers.
¬°awesome!. just awesome & super user friendly & modern! good job üî•üî•üî•
great for mobile small business !. we couldn't live without our quickbooks online mobile app! look up information and match bank transactions right away. would like to see more functionality for customer and vendor invoicing and billing options as well as filtering but overall a great, easy to use tool.
gets the job done. very helpful app. works well. no issues that i have experienced.
so far so good. user friendly.
does it work?. great app. keeps me well ordered and never lets me down
could be better. does not perform the same on my phonetablet as my desktop. i.e automated emails on my desktop autofill my clients name, my phone does not. on my desktop i can switch the order of items on my invoices and estimates, on my phone i cannot. the simple editing features are extremely important on a device that smaller than my hand.
questionable developers and qa. don‚Äôt bother with this app. more time updating this weekly with version changes and bug fixes... jokers
losing functionality with every update. the latest update the passcode no longer allows the user to login, instead a fulllength password is necessary. why they keep removing functionality is beyond me. the analytics is useless, this company needs to collaborate better between teams, mint & quickbooks, it looks like completely separate companies make each app. :(
great for handyman businesses. qb is great for me! i run a handyman business and my office is at my clients place or in my truck. i can sent estimatesinvoices while i am on site. it so nice because i use my tablet or phone when i‚Äôm on the road and when i‚Äôm home i can use qb on my computer and everything is automatically updated
great app. the app takes a bit to get used to but once you've played with it a bit it's very simple to navigate, update bank transactions and so on
awesome product. general contractor have tried a lot of different apps and have spent a few hundred bucks...this one by far is the best for invoicing and providing estimates. very streamlined and quick to learn..
simple + effective. much better than the online and desktop tools available. super accessible, easy to use, and simple interface and controls. 55 stars.
useful. useful for capturing my daytoday personal spendings
update the update, please.. i love this app. i use it every day, but the new update (4.5, released yesterday) will not let me record payments or save new invoices. it forces me to cancel each time, which doesn't save any changes made. please fix asap.
works but needs work. for the most part the product works, but has many errors and sometimes says there are errors but they are never fixed, i run the lasted ios on an iphone 6 and still have many problems
great app. good for a non accounting person like me. i can keep track and give it all to my accountant and it gets done. i love that i can send invoices from my ipad and enter info etc. two thumbs up!
only problem. i have a few problems the app is very slow when editing email address in the send invoice i don‚Äôt see a few things that i‚Äôd like  discounts for example no way to customize message to different customers most of this is pretty minor biggest issue is reconciliation of books at end of year
experience getting worse. entering transaction requires way too many taps. it isn‚Äôt location aware to suggest transactions you just always search. recent updates have some bug that makes the app download the data file with almost every login and login often you must. usually twice a week it loses my password. i have enjoyed quickbooks online but this app experience may have me evaluating competitors in december.
great, not perfect.... if you're looking for snapshots of where your company finances are, this app is great. it works well for giving me good information on the go. however, it seems like real, intensive work is best saved for the online version. i really like it but understand the limitations. worth a try, certainly.
easy to learn. easy to learn good support. i would like to be able to upload invoices sitting in my iphone pdf or ibooks app, or even better, directly from my email attachments, into the qb app when i am entering expenses. currently i only have the option of entering a photo. best wishes, dee
just ok. the mobile version is fine. it the desktop version is full of bugs and slow. wastes a lot of my valuable billing time.
price just keeps going up!. forced to moved to a different app, found this one for ¬£2.99 a month, which seemed fine as i won‚Äôt be using it very much. now the price has gone up to ¬£11.99 in under a year! needs different payment options for those that don‚Äôt use it much and that % increase is insane.
super & excellent apps. very user friendly application . i would recommend this software to other people
great. absolutely love it! i love the fact that i can access my reports from anywhere, mac, ipad or iphone.
not working. i have been using for years on my pc and ipad. now all of a sudden the mobile app is not working on my ipad. not recognizing my email. spoke to tech support....supposed to be fixed but it‚Äôs not.
too good!. nothing beats qbo for its price and simplicity. easiest system to use for those sme not accounting minded but still need to get the job done!
expensebill data missing in app. expense and bill data is not available in the iphone app while accessible online. what is the meaning of the app when i can't see any of my vendor bills or company expenses. development team???
bugs and bugs it a jungle. 1. kicking out of the app very often. 2. not able to email multiple invoices at one time. 3. limited search capabilities. cant search notes and description. :(
great support. we use the app almost exclusively to keep our business mobile. recently had an issue and contacted customer chat to get it resolved. they had me screen record it happening and said they would push to engineering for fix. honestly didn‚Äôt expect anything fast but they fixed the issue and included it in the new patch. it‚Äôs been about a week or less so a big thank you the support teams for getting it fixed and getting us back to normal.
great!. the ipad qb app works great! as a plus the support and development people are very respectful and helpful when it comes to suggestions to make the app even better. to be able to be completely mobile for a small business means you can be more efficient and get paid faster. the only thing the app is lacking is signature capture and then it will be everything you need and there will be no need for apps like invoiceasap.
quickbooks app. it has all the tools i need and is very convenient
owner small massage therapy business. for the small amount of paperwork my business requires, this app is perfect. i can input info before leaving the office and it prompts me with appropriate questions to categorize items properly. very user friendly and convenient.
background usage accounts for 50 percent of battery life. this app completely drains my battery. i thought my battery was broken and was about to replace it, but apple tech report suggested i check on battery usage by app and i discovered quickbooks was the culprit.
excellent. my first time using accounting software this is the easiest i've tried love it
works great. enjoying quickbooks online makes looking at invoices while out of the office really easy. great features
great app. very nice and good
billable expenses. new website and app are nice, except on ios cannot specify expense as billable....why? no clue.
great app. we use everyday for our company
won‚Äôt interface to bank any more. after several months since my bank kicked qb out of accessing my bank account for reconciling, the problem still remains. accessing my bank account and reconciling all transactions over my iphone was my number one reason to use qb. still disappointed. i have to pay a bookkeeper to do my books with qb now. why can xero have bank access but qb can‚Äôt sort itself out after several months !
unusable. stopped working after ios 13 update, can't add expenses and support is unresponsive
great small business tool. great for sending invoices, tracking due invoices, and emailing with document or pic attachments. cut out a good deal of my paperwork.
huge asset for small business. love the flexibility this app provides. i can do everything from the app that i can do from the desktop although it takes twice as long. however, as a small business owner being the accountant and the laborer it is great having the ability to pull up invoices with clients and email invoices on the go.
should be able to snap a pic of a receipt and sort later.. i need to be able to take a picture of my receipts and then when i do the books sort them out and match them to purchases.
app is not functional. the app is keep crushing on iphone xs max every time you i want to create new invoice. billion dollar company but cannot fix bugs for a few months already, its embarrassing.
export. does everything i need it to do but can't export your data on a mac. also crashes in ios 11 beta but not holding that against them since i'm using beta version of ios. works find on my phone using ios 10
great for start up. the app works great! i can do nearly all of my bookkeeping from my phone. if i need more detailed i just use my laptop! the monthly subscription is nice too!
nice app. this is a really good app and i would give it five stars except i keep getting an error message when opening up certain accounts from the chart of accounts.
brilliant app. quickbooks is an amazing app. i'm an electrician with a small business, so i need something quick and easy when i'm in the field. entering expenses and creating invoices is so easy on my tablet andor phone saving me hours per week. great work...i'm very impressed!
easy to work with. it's just incredible to use and work with.
great, just like the web app. love to have these tools handy. recommended.
poor functionality. constant crashes inability to complete selected tasks poor functionality this app try‚Äôs hard but doesn‚Äôt quiet make it with its functions. it didn‚Äôt at all shot me but that‚Äôs what the 3 day free trial is for. i wasn‚Äôt going to rate this app but after they charged me $10.50 for a 1 month subscription after i cancelled and deleted the app; i will rate it
awesome. amazing app perfect
hate the app. limited functionality of the app makes it virtually useless... unless i have access to a pic or laptop, i can't do all the things i need to do. the program itself is good, just not sure why the app hasn't caught up yet.
still useless for me. all i want to do is add my time activity and delayed charges for my clients via my iphone. that's my necessary daily task. i don't need to look at my balance sheet every day, change my company information, or customize my default email message with my iphone.
.. i had to delete the app as it was having many issues. now i can't download it again?
i like this software but not sure. how do i export this information or report or how do i print
can‚Äôt create multiple companies. can‚Äôt create multiple companies or entities with this program. i would have to pay a subscription fee for each company. if i wanted to track my individual expense, my business expenses, and my llc expenses i would be stuck for $720 a year when the 2013 version on my laptop could create unlimited companies and only cost $300 paid in full.
this app is worthless. literally none of the things i routinely do with quickbooks is possible with this app.
limited in ipad. will not allow the entering of purchases on account from suppliers when using the ipad app. seems to be more cash based, unlike the version you log on with you pc or imac.
super & excellent apps. very user friendly application . i would recommend this software to other people
update crashed. i have all of my quickbooks point of sale ipads that cannot open the app since the update! we have all had to resort to computers and phones to run our business! you may want to consider this before you join up with quickbooks! they are notorious for problems relating to their quickbooks online.
great little app. excellent app for basic book keeping invoicing etc and keep up with the book keeping on the fly. but to do the serious stuff you still need to work from a laptop or desktop.
great app when it works.... after update to ios 13 as well as the latest version of the qbo app, i cannot access supplier information. on top of that, i am unable to save expenses that i am trying to enter too. there goes the productivity. qbo team really need to be better at this!
update ruined app. since the last update you cannot run credit cards on the app. it crashes immediately when you attempt to. my business uses qb on 25 devices. all crash when taking payments. this has caused a massive issue for us and clients. beware of putting too many eggs in the basket of a company that can be sloppy with the interface they sell you.
great app, easy to use!. this is a great financial management app. i'm far from an accountant but once you have your chart of accounts set up, keeping track of expenses and income is a breeze! a few swipes of your finger and you can reconcile your bank accounts. if only more things were this easy!
great app!!. just switched from quicken, and i don't know why i waited so long. qb is very versatile and comprehensive.
works great. works great for my small business. not sure why there are bad reviews, qbo keeps up with my customers information, invoices, and estimates. very easy to use. now on this last update, i did have to uninstall and reinstall on my andriod phone, but within 5 minutes i was back up and running.
great app. app is great and worked well with my iphone x but just updated to iphone 11 pro mac and app will not open crashes and closes every time please fix
not bad however. could we have a fingerprint scan to open the app as a measure of security please!!!
"fees on fees. while the app itself works and is fairly handy, i strongly advise against quickbooks as a company. i signed on as a business owner for $6.95 a month and was immediately slapped with over $100 in fees hidden in ""fine print"". worse is the utter inability to get any customer support from intuit. i canceled my subscription and despite already paying for the month, lost access immediately and lost all of my records. then i got billed again. stay away."
bank transactions not loaded. there are several limitations with this app. but my major issue is the inability to load bank transactions. the connected bank account goes sometimes for weeks or months without the transactions transferred to qb. other times they are uploaded every couple of days. there is no option to upload the transactions manually through the app. i called customer service but no one helped. this makes the phone app pretty much useless.
really helpful!!. i am a computer engineer and being able to make estimates and invoices in the field has really helped me!
accept button doesn‚Äôt work.. love the app however this latest update the accept button doesn‚Äôt seem to work so you can‚Äôt accept the new line items from your bank feed.
update asap. i‚Äôve been trying to use the app for a couple weeks now, and it keeps kicking me out. it‚Äôs very annoying!
garbage!. they update the app and completely remove support for ios 8! i understand making a newer version only compatible with newer ios, but why block legacy users all together? it worked great on ios 8 before, now the same version of the app suddenly says i need to upgrade! i pay $30month for this garbage!?
simple.. i'm a 30 yr old first time entrepreneur and small business owner. i wish i had paid a little bit more attention in that intro to accounting course in undergrad. but the beauty of qb is someone like me can get up to speed pretty quickly. what i love about intuit's products is they simplify your life, and qb makes keeping accurate and precise books very gratifying.
report must show sales receipts as well. reports must show sales receipts as well and not only invoices. qb allows you to generate sales receipts for customers who paid at the point of sale, hence the report functionality in the app must show these receipts as sales otherwise, the whole report is meaningless. also, more basic reports are needed such as p&l, balance sheet, suppliers, transactions....etc. thx anyway.
cool app. very easy to use
app crashes. the app crashes immediately when i try to open it. i haven‚Äôt been able to use the app for a few months now which is quite disappointing considering i pay for its services.
app glitches. i get an error message 6000 every time i try to add a customer, payment, or any new information. basically it's not functioning, i have to use the desktop version.
quickbooks. i love this awesome app! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüòç
love quickbooks  improvement always appreciated. i really live the ease of use of quickbooks. the desk top and mobile app are pretty clean. keep building off such a great product. the down side is that some transactions such as bundling downloaded client reimbursable expenses & linking to a single invoice are not intuitive.
fake claim. i am not sure why these companies feel like they have use false advertising to sell their products. i do get it. i understand that some companies, usually the big ones, feel like they have to recoup development costs for their apps. well just be honest then
no multi currency in app. there is no multi currency function in the ipad app making it useless for entering overseas travel expenses.
"ridiculous!. i can't believe that i pay $20 a month for an app that won't even let me ""break out"" deposits!!! i am treasurer for a non profit organization and this is crazy! my $ could, and will be spent elsewhere."
don‚Äôt use this with an ipad.. bought this app and was unable to get it to work with an ipad. 4 hours on the phone with this company and still no success. they charged me and told me to get my money back through apple. there is an open known problem being worked on their end but user‚Äôs beware. you won‚Äôt find out until you‚Äôve paid.
great!!!. i love this app i love qbo what else is there to say. recent update created tons of issues with ios 9.3.3 some glitches evolved not sure who's fault but hope they get fixed. i appear to get error messages entering my expenses :(. can't save invoice created either please fix. otherwise when the app works it's great one star is its current state.
perfect software for the right companies. i absolutely love it! i have a small freelance design company, so i'm billing for services and commissions. there is nothing i need that it doesn't do and do well. i don't need inventory, estimates or payroll, so this program is about as friendly to me as it could possibly be.
qbo is comprehensively awesome!. qbo is comprehensively awesome!
very convenient. it keeps program updated and very handy to access on all platforms
great for small business owners.. awesome app. very convenient and keeps the finances and work orders organized. takes some trial and error but well worth the effort to learn this system. you tube has many instructional videos on how to expedite learning this program. price is reasonable for what you get. don't hesitate to get it. if anything you will learn something.
terrible app. quickbooks is a terrible app on my iphone & my ipad. it's not even a good program on my computer. it's extremely limited & each update does nothing to improve it. if there was another accounting system i could use, i would.
bugs and bugs it a jungle. need to be able to email multiple emails at one time.
this might be 5 stars. the only thing... only thing!!! using square through the app .. or somehow sync invoices so they reflect in qb. if there is a way to do that then this is 5 stars!!
error!. somthing isn‚Äôt working and there is no support from the developer online :
ok. app ok
highly recommend for startups. qbo does everything that i need it to. it is a great dashboard to see where i am at, with the ability to add details to all of my transactions.
missing features. missing bills (that you print cheques and pay later). missing payroll. this would be fine except they're raising the price on everyone in a few months.
quickbooks online : almost there.... ideally, any app should be as close as possible to the desktop experience. whilst still lacking in key features & reports, this app wins easily when compared to its contemporaries. the app is very stable and permit multi file access, which is very useful. basic tasks such invoicing & reciting can be performed (and emailed) etc, but bank rec nciliations can't be reconciled as yet. so 45 from me...
slow to load and outdated info. the mobile app is pretty much useless, continues to give outdated balances, the only report available is a basic p&l. i need to see a running balance, not just the bottom line which is usually wrong but no way to check! i see many updates but no improvements, only rate increases!
excellent. excellent for the ipad love i can do invoicing on the go
excellent app. keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
excellent. i been using quickbooks in various versions since 1996. i upgraded to online in 2015. as i am a working at customers premises, sometimes 15 different a day, the instant invoicing using my iphone saves me having to sit at my office at the end of the day invoicing. another great thing about online is to check any outstanding invoices from customers who request unscheduled visits.
continuing issues. i've had the online and app for over a year and a half but the last 6 months it's a pain. double entries and trouble meshin with my bank for 2.5 months. ugh frustrating
great. amazing app but whoever did that last update screw it all up. can save estimate or invoices. horrible. i hope they refund at least a month of fees because i'm loosing money having to do all my estimatesinvoices at my house instead. needs to be fixed asap.
fantastic app for my ipad pro!. i recently acquired an ipad pro to use for my business and instantly downloaded quickbooks to use on the go. this app has been wonderful for sending invoices, logging my expenses, and managing the books in general. so far, i have yet to experience a crash and everything has been working well for my needs!
love qb online. most time saving, userfriendly, awesome, efficient app ever!!!!
"soooo slow. i have been using this app for about three years , and it was very functional and useful, but now, almost every time i open it, it says ""downloading data,"" and stays there... for 35 minutes doesnt matter whether my phone is on wifi or cell coverage. i hope they fix this bug."
a waste of time. no payroll functions. a big area to not include. i still need my computer to pay staff. missing other features. should be a full functioning app.
app crashing multiple devices (ios 10 & ios 11). i use this app for my business and after the last update the app has been completely useless on my ipad and on my phone. the only way i can log data is by sitting at my computer when i get home from work. please fix asap. using freshbooks until then. thanks.
timesheet and expenses. it would be a great app if our employees could access and input timesheets and expenses. maybe one day.
please add photo ability. please add the ability to upload photos to products and services! you have no idea how much that would simplify my life for me. please! other than that big issue (for me) i'm pretty happy with the way the app works  does all i need it to, except above mentioned issue.
buggy. since updating to the latest version i can‚Äôt view invoices from the home screen or even update and send invoices from the invoices screen. hire some competent engineers.
to glitchy. way to many glitches but worst of all it is supposed to be exactly the same on the deferent computers and some times the same invoices show up on one computer and not on my i pad and only sometimes on my i phone üëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëéüëé
great!. as a first time business owner and user of any accounting software, i am very happy with quickbooks on the whole and this app in particular. easy to use and understand without over simplifying what needs to be done. seamless integration without just about any software make this a great goto for all your small business accounting needs.
not enough!. this app does not have the functionality that qbo has. therefore, useless. if we can't use the ipads in the store, what use is the app? 1. can't enter an invoice with the details 2. can't enter a vendor bill and do splits. 3. can't put payments in undeposited funds. 4. yep, useless.
great updates and really user friendly. all works better than before and integrates brilliantly. makes understanding our financials a doddle!
almost great but not quite there. very useful in collaboration with desktop or online version, but does have a few annoying quirks. i wish the most used item codes would be kept at the top of the list instead of alphabetically with the rest of default ones. and there really needs to be a way to access and review emails sent directly from the app
ipad app. please update your app to be more like the desktop version...i can not track inventory received through the ipad app i purchased and ipad pro hoping to do away with my laptop and so far its been seamless, except for this app not being able to track inventory received. i hope your developers can figure this out before my 8 year old laptop crashes! thanks
the most powerful option for business finances area. i love this app because i have access in my mac and then i can move to my bed with my tablet and continue working on my accounting so easy. the only thing that probably i would add is the access to the items, lists and charts through the reports, as is in the online and the desktop mac app.
was great and then they updated it. i loved this app when i first got it. i used it all the time for 5 months strait, and then they 'updated' it. now, it's awful. i don't see any of the new features and it is buggy beyond belief. please go back to the older version. this is a joke.
i spoke, they listnened. i have had my fair share of frustrations with intuit and when they send out questionnaires i answer them and my biggest complaint was no access to a p&l which is now apart of the app. it's perfect for what i use it for and there's nothing like creating invoices and getting paid on the go. great update and thanks for listening.
basic functions always don't work. touch id malfunctions, syncing is very very slow.
errors galore and inability to log into client accounts. i‚Äôm so disappointed with this app. as an accountant it would be handy to log into client accounts and check figures or enter small changes, but more often than not, i receive an error message and cannot log in. the issue renders this app completely useless.
latest update is garbage. app has been great up until 3 weeks ago now it no longer works! crashes every time i try to open the app.
quickbooks. awesome app.
down graded. i down graded to qb online. it appears it was released about a year too soon. nothing but frustration from day one. the phone app is all but useless.
statement from app ?. works great for me but i wish you were able to print off a statement from the app.
sales tax calculation is wrong. when creating an invoice, the app does not honor customer's sales tax setting. it applies tax even on customers with tax turned off. please fix asap!!!!
owner. love this app!! easy to use and don't what i'd do without it
good but.... very useful, but needs flexibility for budgeting and more reports. i do most of my work on my ipad so it falls short of desktop online version.
ability to do transfers. good app just wish i could do transfers between my bank accounts the same as the online version.
slow, complicated. can't do everything in app, also need the website open. have spent almost a week setting up. terrible. keeps crashing. awful.
incomplete and not easy to use. privacy settings are lacking as they previously were in the online version. to be useful, i need to be able to pass the ipad to a sales associate sioux giving them the amount of access they currently have (with the limited privacy settings). also, the login and password system is cumbersome meaning it isn't quick to open up the app to charge a customers card (faster to run it through the online version)
um yeeaaa.... it‚Äôs kind of crappy i can‚Äôt link my bank accounts with out manually entering the transaction it kinda takes the quick out of quickbooks
quickbooks online is amazing. long time user and love the online version.
great functionality across platforms. i use qbo to do estimates and invoicing on a laptop, ipad and iphone. i occasionally swipe a credit card too and they all perform very well. little bit presentation on each device but they all work!
existing customers badly treated. this company refuse to permit existing customers to switch to (the less expensive) simple start package even when they meet all criteria. go elsewhere instead.
very handy accounting app. this app is very useful to always have a snapshot of your business at your fingertips.
qbooks online. the windows version is pretty decent but the mobile app is horrible. the invoicing option is not that great. i give it 2 star just because it is accessible from every where.
incomplete and not easy to use. privacy settings are lacking as they previously were in the online version. to be useful, i need to be able to pass the ipad to a sales associate sioux giving them the amount of access they currently have (with the limited privacy settings). also, the login and password system is cumbersome meaning it isn't quick to open up the app to charge a customers card (faster to run it through the online version)
please fix. we use quickbooks constantly. it has enabled us to grow at a much faster rate, helped us keep our books in order, and allows us to take online payments easily. however, the recent update has been causing the app to close unexpectedly and also has many other glitches. please fix intuit. we are not hating on quickbooks, but this is the worst update we have ever seen.
like the app. i find the app to be very useful in the field. unfortunately since the latest update adding new customers seem to slow the app down and to a crawl. wish there was a way to get that bug fixed
sweet business app. fantastic app for running my business when in remote areas or on the go!! no glitches with the app either!
poor need lots of work. this app is terrible on the ios and android. i‚Äôm using it on both and it has tooo many bugs...
not happy with new update. new update has made navigating to the chart of accounts very annoying. you have to access one of 3 accounts (determined by qbs) that show up on the main page and then push the back button, magically the accounts list appears. poor design, but a simple fix. i don‚Äôt mind that the menu button has moved to the bottom, just please add a ‚Äúchart of accounts‚Äù link. thanks.
qbo app. very good indeed!
great app!. it's clear they've put a lot of thought into the experience here. smooth ui and they keep adding features. thank you!
40 min on hold with customer support. the app works fine, but 40 minutes on hold with customer support? not so much.
new update keeps crashing. well ever hour or two it crashes while i am in the middle of looking things up or when i am making an estimate for a customer. and this is with the pastiest update. oh and it keeps telling me there is a new update, but i already have it. fix it, my renewal is coming up and you aren‚Äôt the only game in town
incomplete. well laid out and functional. without banking though it's not as useful as i'd like.
too many problems entering expenses. he expenses are not taking the payee. i had to switch to desktop to enter the expenses with the payee. hopefully quickbooks will address it.
crashing at start up with ios 13. love this app but it crashes with ios 13 :( please fix
works well and good value. we migrated from the desktop version and that was relatively easy to do and the online version is cost effective and does what it says on the tin! it's great that it's on my phone and ipad as well as desktop gives me access when i need it. no issues so far and the support is good.
app crashing ios13. app is crashing in io13
stopped working. i used to get nice p&l reports on my dashboard. all those reports disappeared after latest iphonr update.
meh. so slow loading new pages invoice templates are ugly hard to view invoice view doesn‚Äôt quite seem ‚Äúgoogle‚Äù more like a government website that got a makeover
love it. very useful
paid app. app costs 8.99 a month
bad update. used to work good until last update now when i open the app is says downloading company data, gets stuck there for ages. if it finally loads, there are no customer invoices, just payments. tried deleting the app and reinstalling but does the same thing. the pc app works fine and my employees have samsung phones and they haven't complained of any issues may just be an iphone app problem.
amazing app!!!!. love quickbooks and also the app. excellent layout design. just one thing is needed. please allow the app to support touchid for the login process. this would be just the best update ever! thanks
all that you need at the same app. great app, easy to navigate
i also should have read the reviews. i only use my quickbooks to track expenses and deposits due to the nature of my business. i have been trying to use the mobile version of this program now, after being on the pc version for over 10 years, and still cannot find a way to log my deposits. i can accept payments for invoices, which i do not use for the majority of my business but cannot enter a straight deposit.
good resource. i will update this as i see necessary, haven't made a customer service call yet. but overall the navigation is something to get used to because it's very in depth and many details that you would expect are included with the software.
useless. i am an avid qbo for ie customer for many years, but this ipad app is useless. can't do anything with it, and can not see banking info, the most important thing in accounting! if you want to view customervendor names that can be done, but you can't work in this app. view only.
crash. crashes each time i try to add a customer. i can't do anything with it now. iphone 6
excellent program. we are extremely happy with this program, it has made our company administrators live so much easier.
give me a refund. i hate this app it‚Äôs trash an i want my money back !!!
update is horrible!. i've been using qb online app for a long time. and it seem like the app finally had started to improve and now this latest update has caused some great frustration. i do not recommend updating totally get these glitches resolved.
great ap. great easy to use app really close to getting rid of my laptop entirely
good. great product however cannot get online payment via paypal to work. also would be convenient if could add accounts via the app and not need to log onto computer.
fire the entire team. worst app. login doesn't work. recovery doesn't work. craptastic adventure
great mobile app. this app is perfect for my business. i'm out of the office majority of the day so being able to send or create estimates and invoices is very nice. quick and easy
awesome app. it's a womderful app, so versatile and functional
easy to use. no experience needed. you can perform 95% of what you can do on the computer on this app.. the only things you cannot do include things like personalizing invoice colors and options, and i had trouble sending a single invoice to two recipients.. i was able to do both successfully on the computer but not the app.
jireh landscaping. great!! great program and app!!
useless app. takes forever or even never to load
love it. i am an accountant and this is the software i use and recommend to all of my customers.
"new ""update"" = no more watch app, instability. why did you take away the watch app?"
bad program. won't send estimates and invoices. buisness cash flow has been screwed up.
great mobile app, but it has a mind of its own. i've found the ability to work remotely as a great plus for estimates, electronic invoices and checking customer records. i have just had issues with downloaded deposit amounts and matching for reconciliation. automatic entry into register has to go!
worthless on ios13. out of all the apps i have, this is the only one that wasn‚Äôt ready for ios13. it was worthless during the entire public beta process & i was hoping with the actual ios 13 release, it would be updated. not the case, still worthless. doesn‚Äôt work on my iphone or ipad. it was the convenience of having quickbooks on the go that sold me in the first place. not the case anymore.
waste of time. glad i haven't gotten past the trial offer because nothing syncs with my quickbooks online. so the obvious question is what's the freaking point of this app? completely unimpressed. someone's making money off of doing nothing. wow. i want that job!
love it. convenient and easy. my 2 favourite things. just wish when a customer overpays, it would reflect that on the next invoice. i have to keep track of credits by hand.
awful. i don‚Äôt typically leave negative reviews but if i have to watch an invoice that i am editing disappear one more time i‚Äôll loose my mind. clunky and prehistoric programme pen and paper would be quicker
having issues with iphone 11. after installing the app, and attempting to access it results in crashing.
no sales receipts. this app is pretty decent, but lacks the essential functionality of sales receipts. gopayment isn't a solution either because it doesn't link to customers. when can we expect sales receipt functionality?
app problems. okay!! so for like 2 years, your app will not configure with the desktop version and none of the email addresses get updated. so in my case, i had been sending invoices to the wrong person and couldn't figure out why i wasn't getting paid? fix this like it used to work 3 years ago
needs work. glitches, freezes all the time, constant updates asks me to review app while i'm using app so annoying
can't save an invoice since update.. please fix asap. i use to use this app everyday and now i can't. i love quickbooks but this is bad!!
east coaster. i love the online version. i can use my laptop, ipad or iphone to update, send quotes or invoices and even take payments via email.
love the app!. convenient
no complaints. does the job.
good app. excellent
major flaw  can't run payrol. 3 stars as you are unable to run payrol on the go which is a major part of this app that is missing.
spotty & unreliable. i rarely review any apps that i use unless they are particularly great or particularly terrible. in this case, sadly it is the latter. this app doesn't have basic features that should be included, and about half of my invoices i cannot open from the app because apparently it uses some feature in their api that is nonsupported or not working. regardless, if you are looking for a 21stcentury accounting solution and app this is sadly not it at all.
superbly designed. having used two competitors' products before, i've been very pleasantly surprised with quickbooks. it's really easy to use but, at the same time, it has lots of really helpful features. the app is well designed but my only gripe is that i am sometimes unable to login. the problem usually corrects itself after a while, but it's a bit annoying when i need it at the time. nevertheless, the product is so good that this doesn't even bother me much.
progress billing & payroll. those two items alone differentiate this on line accounting software from all the others. their tech support is always helpful. progress billing is done through projects, it‚Äôs getting better, the use ability is getting better. this also allows project costing. üëçüèªüëçüèª
amazing!!!. i love the fact that i can take a pic of a source document, it it will convert it into pdf file and attach it to the transaction! and i can do pretty much everything in bookkeeping from my iphone!
love it. i am an accountant and this is the software i use and recommend to all of my customers.
good, not great. you can do the basics, like sync bank accounts, run a few basic reports. but you can‚Äôt take many useful actions or get reliable search results. the bank accounts render weirdly. it‚Äôs more like a novelty rather than a tool.
very nice.. very helpful considering that is cloud app. i work with it everywhere a go.
great app. makes life easy. one addition will make it perfect. add journal entry to the app.
does not do simple qb tasks. this app does not have all the functions as the computer online version. i can't run simple reports and the payroll app which is separate does not allow me to make changes to the employee information. doesn't function like you need it to and it put me in a bind when i went out of town with just my ipad. i would not even give it one star. worthless.
excellent. does what it says on the tin.. excellent app. works brilliantly on the ipad, sometimes find it a little sluggish on the iphone but i put that down to the poor wifi we sometimes have and bad signal from phone operator. anyways it's so easy to use and i can produce an invoice there and then and email to the client instantly. don't know why i took so long to move from desktop to quickbooks online.
life saver!. i absolutely love this app. when i first started out and i didn't have that many funds in the bank, this was one expense i didn't even have to overthink. after using quickbooks online app for only a week i knew i could never go back to organizing my finances on my own. i use it every single day!
still no touch id. i used to think this was a great app, but now with these last 2 updates, i have to constantly uninstall the app and still no touch id. why when something works fine can you not just let it be.
service after the sale is nonexistant!. i‚Äôve been trying to get incorrect billing corrected for almost a month now. customer service directs me to my sales rep and the sales rep no longer responds to emails from me or his coworkers in customer service. try waveapps...it seems to be comparable to the simple start plan and it‚Äôs free!
improving. each new version a little better than the last. just like qb online for mac app, both need more features to compete with the rest of the qb product line.
qbooks is a entrepreneur's dream. i've been doing bussines as general contractor the last 20 yrs, always i tried to find a software where i can handle all my administrative information at all (invoicing, payroll, expenses) with this apps you can get everything at your fingers reach, so you can control all money inout. it's a world marvel!
crashing. after 3 new updates in the last month app keeps crashing and losing everything i am doing.
amazing. at last i can invoice on the move and do the rest of my book keeping as i go. great app and easy to use.
great app. it is what it is. it an app. it won't have all the features of a computer and you should not expect it to. does exactly what i need it to in the field.
keep having to uninreinstall. i keep having to uninstall app then reinstall because it gives me a black screen, then closes out. this is the 2nd time i‚Äôve had to do this and it appears it may be a bug of sorts. overall happy with the app but please fix this glitch.
great app. it's great to manage a small business.
invoice won‚Äôt work with ios 13. i‚Äôm trying to put a new customer in on a invoice and the app just turns black and white screen. plz update! i run my entire business off this app
app crashes in ios9. this app was working great before the recent update. app just crashes when i try to open. i use an ipad 3rd gen running the latest version of ios9. please fix!!
love it, but needs some work. reeeallly wish i could cut a po on the app. other than that, the app is a great tool
not incredibly intuitive. want to be able to do limited things on the ipad... tried to reset front page to be entire year not just the month.... hopefully that can be done. def room for improvement. not a clean download, either....
user friendly. easy to use!
owner. i have been quite impressed! small owneroperator, able to send invoices, estimates, et al. from my trucklove it!
"it doesn't synchronize. the app is totally unusable. it doesn't synchronize customers and supplier and the transaction with those missing from the list result as incomplete. tried also to dis install and reinstall: same story. on top of this it must also said that the assistance is unresponsive, many days and repeated enquiries to finally get emails full of irritating smileys and useless answers like ""we are constantly improving the apps to serve our mobile customers""."
handicapping of mobile platforms versus online. numerous important reporting tools and account management features do not exist in the app version. qb developers have heavily impaired the app experience. the huge complexity of importing transactions is an unacceptable burden on the user. also, this is not ipad pro optimized.
some good features but limited and pricey.. search features are extremely limited. find an invoice using customer po number? can't. essentially, to find something you have to already know where it is. data differs from desktop version sometimes. only 2 generic reports available in mobile app. disappointing functionality considering the qb online monthly fees!
the recent update fixed the problems!. this app seems to be back to normal! üòÑ qb online works great for working on the field and being mobile! üòä
amazing app, but few things need to be improved.. very good app, but needs few things like the web version. if thats added then its the best app for start up businesses.
a great experience. this new update has just all the features required from this app and more. not just do you guys listen but act as well. kudos. the best cloud service, that can be.
problems. when it works it's good. have to sign out and back in or it crashes when customers need to be entered, along with other options.
nice apps. nice apps
business. great app
new update issues. the previous update solved these issues, but this current update causes error messages with sales rep login whenever creating invoices, and also causes printing communication errors constantly.
looking for another software. they always have ‚Äú50% off‚Äù that‚Äôs just to get you because i have a year with them and it is the 3rd. time they had raised the price ! i‚Äôm now looking for another software.
boost to my business image with my ipad!. i went from handwriting every estimate, sales receipt and invoice to bringing in new paperless technology. at the end of the day i would have to have my wife input everything in our quick books online. then file everything in our office. it's not only impressive to our clients, but it also eliminates filing and an extra step of data entry, it saves time and money and gives you a competitive edge over your competition!
love it. best app ever
statements. wish i could send statements from the app. i do love the convenience of the app!
jason marquez. this app according to me is best as it's not that complicated and makes my business easy, i've not used any other accounting app so i consider this very easy for any layman who is not very good in accounting. it could have had few more options like individual job closing so to get more accurate and decrease the paper work.
great app. i wish there was a way we could charge credit cards that are already on file
not a good app. too many bugs.
whatsapp on iphone. the experience is very good with quick books on iphone. but it is not connecting directly to whatsapp while sending the invoice. the invoice have to be first downloaded into the folder and later it has to be sent.
overall ok. if you have an issue good luck getting a hold of customer support. freezes up at least once a week and sometimes i can‚Äôt get into my invoices. for what i am paying for i expect more
more than convenient, it's necessary. having the app makes it so much easier to do business on the go. you can send estimates and invoices before the client meeting has even ended. efficient and essential!
nice tool for how i use qbo. i keep books for a couple of pool service companies. they often have questions while in the field. this works great for answering while on the go. i wouldn't want to work only with mobile, but very helpful
worst ever app. i have no idea why is this app on app store. the moment i sign in it says your session is expired and you need it sign in again. thats the only vicious circle of time wastage is what this app has to offer its customer. worst experience ever
slow. can be great and convenient but it can also be very slow (just like the online version). won't always let you edit invoices through the app.
easy to use for the busy professional. as a busy selfemployed person, quickbooks mobile gives me the easeofuse that i need on the go. i can give instant quotes, create and send invoices, accept payments and avoid the headaches of being tied to a desk to get the job done.
pathetic. when will intuit wake up and get a real program for the ipad? very limited unless all you want is invoicing....disappointed....was hopeful at one point but have had it with intuit
a changing life app. i‚Äôm new to the u.s and this app helps a lot to get organized. just love it.
needs improvement. i love the desktop version but my app version and even the online version never works right! there is always something that doesn't work. i always go through the whole estimate or invoice and then it won't save it for me! very frustrating and i wish they could work out all of the kinks.
okay. i'm new to doing my own bookkeeping and find this product clunky and not very easy to use. issues with importing transactions and program changing dates and the order compared to the bank. it's not very easy to see what account transfers are moving tofrom. it's hard to distinguish credits for debits. poor customer service. no good summary graphs. slow to attach receipts. multiple clicks to do basic things. cuts off file names if there too long.
truly mobile accounting apps. i have tried for a few days and it give me an impression that i can finish all my accounting without going back to desktop. it use the camera of phone wisely.
great for the mobile user. some bugs but they get fixed sooner or later
streamlines my life. love the app. user friendly. will give it 5 stars when it has photo recognition of my receipts and auto populates data from the photo.
keeps everything in one place. great app! i keep all my business and personal expenses logged and in place from my phone. i can also track multiple companies. gives me so much piece of mind and way easier for keeping track of taxes and book keeping.
love this app and it's capabilities. the only feature i wish it had is to be able to see bills from suppliers.
fantastic app!. i can perform easily 90% of our quickbooks administrative work on the app version. this allows our business to save time and money! way to go guys!
ios 11 not ready? lot of bugs and crashes. every time i‚Äôm make a new invoice it crashes and take a lot to load and open, still missing two things, send invoices by text message and option to choice your start screen menu
unique landscaping. it‚Äôs simple to use and helps to keep up with you‚Äôre accounting, totally recommend it
extremely limited. no credit memos, you can't have a simple addition of how much you have to receive in open invoices at a specific date, no journal entries. i have only my ipad pro and if i try to access the web version, it's not compatible with any browser on ios. so you're stuck and you need a pcmac only for these things. it's a terrible, terrible experience.
worthy app, very user friendly !!. personally this app is unbelievable. it dose pretty much everything. however, it would be even better if you could set up folders in a name customer by you. second, it would be even better if you could access certain command requests without it buggingout. so far that has only happened once. otherwise it would have got five star.
tremendous time saver. i rarely login to quickbooks online any more and have never looked back from switching from the full desktop version. the mobile app is a tremendous time saver and allows be to better server my clients.
easy and userfriendly always available. i've only worked with quickbooks desktop version. so far i have been using this for a week it allows me to do invoices on the fly. and i can check my staff input at any time, very handy would recommend to anyone. especially small business!
electrical contracting business. very easy and convenient to use. my accountant can log on to it from her office saving me the time and the trip. i appreciate the phone app especially for unexpected service calls.
work in progress. i remember the 1st version of qbo . it has continued to evolve because you listen to the users. hire more technical staff to add features to both the reg. online version and the mobile app. i am a quickbooks proadvisor for both the online and desktop versions. i love the the products but always want more.
touch id not working when app is shut down.. touch id needs to work all the time. not just when app is running in the back ground. come on quickbooks fix this bug.
good app poor customer service. was trying to switch over my account settings and the representative i had helping me seemed very lost and wasn‚Äôt of any help. still confused on how to swap my account to a different package and receive refunds on duplicate charges. really quite frustrated. besides that the app itself provides the services i need.
new to business and this is great. i have now completed my second year running my business and without a doubt i owe some of my success to quickbooks as i don't have an admin person it helps me manage things also creates the professional image i need. i prefer using the web platform but when i am on the go and making small purchases for clients i love to add the expenses to their invoice on my phone before i forget!
crashes all the time and there‚Äôs no way to ask for help.. this app crashes every time i update my iphone, even when i update the app. don‚Äôt even bother trying to contact qb about it, they‚Äôll tell you to uninstall and reinstall (like you don‚Äôt know) and then that‚Äôs about the extent of their support.
needs more features. i recently got an ipad. i really would love to use this app instead of having to go to the website through safari (which is horrible on the ipad). however, without custom reports, this app is very limited.
app crashes constantly. i used to love this app. the last couple of months the app crashes daily and multiple times. i‚Äôm in the middle of working and the app says critical updates are needed and logs me out. i‚Äôm extremely frustrated with this considering i pay over $20month to use this software across all my devices.
quickbooks online : almost there.... ideally, any app should be as close as possible to the desktop experience. whilst still lacking in key features & reports, this app wins easily when compared to its contemporaries. the app is very stable and permit multi file access, which is very useful. basic tasks such invoicing & reciting can be performed (and emailed) etc, but bank rec nciliations can't be reconciled as yet. so 45 from me...
useful app. the app is very helpful for my business, i just which the stock category could be more detailed towards distribution more. but i do give the app the thumbs up üëçüèæüëçüèæ
my everyday app. love how easy this app is to use
great app but. we need to have the ability to track mileage within the online version. also need to be able to auto fill a lot of data over to turbotax and allow it to do personal property taxes. i think the cost of this service is high for compared to the desktop version of which you can do more with. please work on the updates and continue to offer a great product.
pretty great app. i've been using the app for 4 months now. it's great if you're a small business owner that wants to be able to pull reports on the go without having to carry your laptop around. touch id support was a great addition
waste of time. horrible sync, features missing. do not waste your time.
horrible mobile support!. this app has a ton of problems and nobody at intuit cares to fix it. app won't load half the time, invoices do not show up, errors all the time, signature capture doesn't work, and no support available for the mobile app. the only thing they know is to tell you to uninstall and reinstall it which fixes nothing! if they don't get their issues fixed, i am switching!
freelance business functions like agency. this app is brilliant. i can check the status of invoices, p&l's, reference invoices, and client trends. best business app i have on my phone!
no supplier invoice. invoices from suppliers can not be captured on the app. you have to log onto the main website  which is extremely slow and cluttered to navigate on a mobile phone.
awesome software. i'm a creative and figures aren't my thing, and i find it a dream to use. i'm so glad my accountant recommended it. having your accounts in the cloud just makes the whole laborious process a snip!
does not attach invoices when emailed. i was excited to finally see this app be available. everything i need to do is included. however... i've noticed that when i email out an invoice from the ipad app to a pc, the recipient does not get the attached or embedded invoice. i hope this gets corrected soon, it's very annoying.
great accounting app. i've been using the quickbooks app for a over a year now and i love how it allows me to stay on top of my business accounting. i love that the app allows me to take a snapshot of my receipts and link them to their corresponding expense transactions within quickbooks.
customer search bar is gone. i can‚Äôt search for clients when i‚Äôm in the app. now i have to search and click in the left letters to get close to their name. i‚Äôm not able to search by phone number either. i‚Äôm very disappointed they made this change
good for invoices. the mobile app doesn‚Äôt have all options from the desktop app. and it‚Äôs something that makes sense... i mostly use the mobile app to check on invoices status. also the alerts ... it sent notification when an invoice is paid, and some basic information as well.
awesome. this app is awesome quick efficient and mobile please consider for small business accounting needs
crashes!!!!. don't update!!! latest update crashes app on opening data download!!! why don't these geeks test these updates before posting!!!!
awesome. such a great package. it made my life so easy with the phone app that i can raise invoices and quotes on the go. it also makes your business look heaps bigger and professional by having proper invoicing that allows taking signature on quotes too. loving it.
best accounting app except for some glitch. it is the best accounting app that i had so far. i like the inventory part. what i don't like is that the activities for the suppliers are empty but with the web and desktop app the activities appear.
best app for small business. i love it, it's so easy and quick to use. it's become a life saver for me.
app has connectivity issues. anytime i log into the app it causes me to have to relink my bank accounts every time. if i stay out of the app everything works appropriately. i can log onto different devices through the browsers without issue but the second i log onto the app on a tablet or phone, it will disconnect my bank accounts.
i spoke, they listnened. i have had my fair share of frustrations with intuit and when they send out questionnaires i answer them and my biggest complaint was no access to a p&l which is now apart of the app. it's perfect for what i use it for and there's nothing like creating invoices and getting paid on the go. great update and thanks for listening.
lifesaver. i love this app, it saves me so much time on the road and so much paperwork later.
update issues. i have used this app for years with no operating issues. unfortunately the last two updates have disrupted my business flow. now i can't even open the app. hopefully with the recent price increase intuit will have the resources to figure this out. my rating is based on recent update experiences.
mobile app. you cannot check your inventory or edit invoices from the mobile app.
easy. easy to use, and has all the features i need to run my lawn care business. i recommend it to everyone. my only issue was getting my subscription paid for. i worked it out by calling customer service and they were awesome.
great app but limited. love the app and how easy it is to use. would love to be able to input expenses, would make it a 5 star app for me then!
i like it. i like it good app
don‚Äôt update to ios 13 if you want this to work. there a so many bugs with this app now that ios version 13 has been released. you can‚Äôt even enter an expense now without an error popping up that you need to create a template. quickbooks online support has been no help. they advised i use the browser on my phone. what‚Äôs the point of the app then? test test test folks.
does what it should. i have being using it for a year and it really does what it should. i get my banking done and it thing is great when exporting to my account.
crashes often. this app goes from being usable to worthless on a whim.
major flaw  can‚Äôt add receipts to expenses. no dropbox or photo option. they advertise this system as super easy and convenient. you can‚Äôt add receipts from photos or dropbox. that makes the ‚Äòadd attachment ‚Äò pretty much pointless. i take a picture of an expense receipt but 0 way of adding it ... seriously. who designed this app.???
michelle. very easy to use!! almost like being on my pc
