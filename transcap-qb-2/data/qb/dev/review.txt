. great app. takes a bit of getting used to, but once you are it's really easy
couldn't perform like we do without. great app!!!! highly recommended. tracks and categories everything with moderate input from you. great on tax day!
brilliant app with loads of features!. so easy to use. so easy to learn. instant bank feeds. invite your accountant & bookkeeper & other users. so much support from intuit & the australian team. what's not to like? intuit have put together a great product for the small to medium business owner. thoroughly recommend this product.
. app transitions from mobile to desktop to email flawlessly. easy to edit & automatically updates to the emailed copy. very easy to use. very intuitive...
. good customer care.
touch id and pin not working. i down loaded the update; the update was suppose to help improve touch id and the pin. however, now bone of them work and i have to sign in every time. i tried it on my iphone and ipad neither work. disappointing
. business on the go this is an excellent app
great. it is a great way of keeping on top of my finances, invoicing and money owed. allows invoices to be raised on the go when small jobs are completed. can see how it will adapt as my business grows as well
. it makes life easier!
un most para las empresas. la mejor app y software para llevar la contabilidad de tu empresa. sencillo y en línea! te calcula todo limpio y sin problemas
new version stinks. one of the main reasons i use the app is so that i can pull up my customers entire transaction history when i'm out in the field. the previous version did that beautifully. other problems as well.
does not compare to ipad version.. i am an android man all the way but very dissatisfied with quickbooks online for android. i purchased quickbooks online after seeing it on a friends ipad. i was disappointed to find that it looked nothing like my friends version. the layout on android in comparison looked very primitive and unintuitive. it does not even capture signatures like the ipad version.
"cool expenses feature allows upload of receipt  needs croppdf tool. one of the best parts of the app is the ""expenses"" feature, which allows you to enter all of the details of an expense on the go, including the expense account, how you paid (credit card, etc), and any memodescription of the transaction. i'd like to see the image upload function in expense allow for cropping, and even better, auto pdf conversion with cropping, like the camscanner app"
. qbo a great experience, seamless on mobile and desktop. highly recommend!
excellent. does everything i need & it synchronizes with other apps i use.
not happy any longer!. having issues logging in every single time now, very frustrating and not happy at all. always asking for finger print, and when typing in my password, it takes about 5 attempts before it’ll login to my company info. also having a constant lag when trying to inputsubmit any items to customers. this is extremely upsetting when trying to submit invoices before a deadline.
android app. android app on phone lately does not open...
cheap & easy. this program is cheaper than other accounting software & is easy to use.
cpo. love, love, love qb app! i can create invoices & sales receipts on the go & easily  even process credit card payments.
great timesaver. i used the free app and i have made up my mind that i will be purchasing this for my small construction business.
small business accounting. very helpful software for my business. has everything from accounting software to expenses, to employee payroll and deductions. has helped me become more efficient with my time. makes estimating and invoicing more streamline.
. it would be great if you could see what the bank balance is. new update, you can now see your balance sheet so you can tell what your bank balance. good update.
. can not change company name it auto put in my email and then the cord company after so is no good to me
excellent update!. thanks very much for the update, all my recent activity imported and the reports are very much welcomed! this has definitely made me happy. cheers!
does not show suppliers. since update app does not show suppliers or let you add expense, which makes mobile app a waste of time
suporte péssimo!!!. o suporte nunca resolve nada, fiz uma reclamação de bug sério a um ano e nunca foi resolvido, tentei contato essa semana pra ver se iriam tomar uma atitude mas a resposta é sempre a mesma “o time de desenvolvimento está trabalhando nisso, não temos acesso a eles e nem informações a respeito” então fica aí com o seus deuses do desenvolvimento que eu em 2020 eu parti conta azul!!!
. lo ove it. load expenses with receipt easily
. handy app!
rubbish. absolutely rubbish since the last update . keeps crashing on iphone xr. screen message = app needs to close due to critical updates. happens 2030 x times a day when trying to set up an invoice estimate etc. test your updates before release you them, you idiots!
. it will not show proper reports when there is multiples companies in a login (this problem is only on my android phone)
. useless app. waste of money. lousy support. subscribe at your own risk. i am cancelling mine
amazing app. i got this because of danny devito
has its benefits.. very nice to write an invoice on the go. but need more invoice templates for the app version. online you can switch templates, need to be the same in the app. effective once you learn the app. not perfect by any means.
needs work. glitches, freezes all the time, constant updates asks me to review app while i'm using app so annoying
pretty lame. seriously? the thing crashes a lot , but i can deal with that. the real problem for me is the lack of calendar in the invoice line item. i would love to use this, but if i can't put the date that i provided a service in my invoice, the it is useless to me. too bad safari doesn't work either, or i would just use that.
. it wont let me use time activity can u please update it cause we need to use it in the ceild more than at the office
. great app
great app. could do with a little bit more graphic approach, but very effective.
. maybe it's my phone but the app runs incredible slow!
why pay for a subscription. when i bought quickbooks for the computer?
. the app is as easy to use as the desktop online version.
new receipt identification is much worse. the new version of the identification of receipts when taking a picture to upload to an expense is much much worse than the previous implementation. this version hasn’t worked accurately once in 30+ pictures, whereas the old version worked accurately 90%+ of the time. how does this stuff get through testing...? :
. easy to set up and easy to use i reccommend talking to an accountant if your setting up a small business
can't save an invoice since update.. please fix asap. i use to use this app everyday and now i can't. i love quickbooks but this is bad!!
time saver, makes everything simple. thus app saves time and allows for doing simple tasks on the go making my church more accurate and efficient
. love it. recommended by a friend makes life easy. my team in the office can create an invoice and i just fill in the blanks get customer to sign when job is complete and sent before leaving site.
. still using this app. still easy to use, still like it! great for what i need.
stopped working on samsung galaxy s6. never had a problem with the app till about 3 weeks ago. it stopped working on my samsung galaxy s6 for no reason. i'm a small business that's on the road a lot and need to be able to send invoices on the spot. please fix it.
useful. i don't use it often, but when i do its a lifesaver.
. great app for billing lets you work right from your phone
useless!. who is writing these positive reviews? this app is completely useless. it has none of the functionality of qb online, and neither does the mobile version accessible from a browser. with all of the money we spend monthly on qb products, the lack of useable features on mobile devices is extremely disappointing. can't even get a register balance? ridiculous!
kerry pabian. are you kidding me !!! app is crashing on my ipad since the update ! why do you always do updates right before its time to do billing ?
makes life easier. does everything i need! only 1 suggest...i want to sort quotes by date created...
a great improvement over the mac desktop version. it saves me tons of time that i used to spend recording payments, expenses and running reports. client payments are easily paid via credit card by the client and automatically applied to the invoice. it has simplified my accounting.
a good assistant on the go. the phone app doesn't do as much as i'd like but i couldn't run my business without the software!
. best app
. terrible app and company. they hold your money and request ridiculous amounts of proof to get it back.
great program. i am a startup welding company, so computers are not my strong suit. literally self taught with qb’s help section, and a couple video tutorials. i mange my companies financials, expenses and payables on my own. this is a big feat being a neanderthal who sticks metal together.
great app but needs improvement. there are various things you can’t do on app .example you can’t set recurring transaction, use batch actions for reminders. for indian users , they have not launched quickbooks payment. there is no customer portal ,there should be system for sending invoice and reminder link via sms overall it is good app and all does the basic stuff but should look forward to integrate above stuff as well
. it makes creating estimates simpler. i used to fumble my way thru, now it's simple and fun!
. this app is fantastic and easy to use
app problems. app keeps crashing haven’t been able to create invoices for days
. just to clarify, if you are based in the eu and therefore required to comply with gdpr, you need to know that your data is stored in the usa. the software if very good, but this is a huge security issue that they refuse to answer clearly
terrible. terrible. the support can't even figure it out.
bugs and bugs it a jungle. 1. kicking out of the app very often. 2. not able to email multiple invoices at one time. 3. limited search capabilities. cant search notes and description. :(
. great app to get financial control of your business
annoyed again!!. i did the latest update and now i can’t even open this damm app! terrific ay! any suggestions qb’s!? can you get this sorted asap. a few updates prior to this lasted one, after that particular update all my company details except my abn disappeared, why? the app didn’t seem to save my details properly as i added them and it was like that until the following update. then everything was back to normal. pretty annoying!!
. great app, doesn't crash and still much to learn from it bur its helping keep my business organized
good, but too limited.. as others have posted, this app would be infinitely more useful if it had more of the functionality of the desktop browser based system. being mobile means i can't do many if the things i'd like to.
quickbooks on the go!!!!. i love the program and app. i find that it's easier through the app since i can just take the photo right from my phone. i recommend this for anyone!!!!
. would give 5 if... i could view an invoice after it has been paid. the information is incomplete
. i travel for work and this app is awesome. i can write and email estimates, invoices, and recieve payments on the fly. it makes my life way easier.
. the app worked great before, it had some minor issues here or there but now it is horrible. when i try to add an expense it only shows me 4 of my vendors and the only account i can assign is the cogs account. now i have to save all my receipts and remember to enter them when i get back to the office. what a pain. yes, my desktop app works just fine. please fix the issue, i loved the functionality before.
. worst app website will not open properly in mobiles and ask for reset repeatedly for same user id, useless
. they said in your invoice that you can cancel anytime and it's not true! it has a glitch and i couldn't cancel it. make me lost two days trying to cancel it and then even charge me the month and did not give back my money. they went from 17 dollars a month to 40 dollars per month! don't never quickbooks
excellent app. this app is amazing, makes my life so easy and customer service is very helpful.. will definitely recommend. just one thing that needs working on, app does not sync with my barclays bank account so i have to export statements manually and upload to app, otherwise 5 star from me.
. terrible app, customer service is a joke with no follow up. switching to a different accounting software.
great!!. works so well. love how easy it is to use, love how seamless the app works as well as the computer version. so easy to send invoices via email. was so happy when i found out easy it is to use!
app crashes ughhh. app crashes after you sign in. please fix!
easy and super user friendly. first time user of this type of app but it was easy to set up. sent out my first invoice after 1hr already.
great tool. awesome app, so far so good
. ok app email invoice doesn't work version 3.8 been unable to send invoices via email for over a week now.
. makes life so much easier, i can input paymentsreceipts from the couch...ideal!
. this app sucks! i can't even login
. good app
great program. it's so easy to use, i love it.
broken after update. not updating customer data, crashing, please fix it, i have a business to run!
bad program. won't send estimates and invoices. buisness cash flow has been screwed up.
terrible app. keeps crashing. keeps dumping you out telling you that “critical updates “ and must login again. try to login and  am a very longtime customer  it tells you your company is nonexistent. ba humbug. complain to intuit and they say use a “supported” device. in other words: don’t use the app. time to find software other than quick books.
very satisfied!. been using the mobile app for the past 3 months now, and i can say it does everything i need. very easy to issue invoices, receive the money, match, reconcile the bank. the support people are very helpful and have a lot of patience!
missing data on iphone and ipad. i have an issues where invoices are missing for some customer on both iphone and ipad. the show up absolutely fine on the web. i can see the payments but get the error when i open the payment qbm.error.00500000.reason.iphone. please fix asap
great app. love this app. it helps me so much
where is the option to invoice % of jobs.. i’m a painting contractor and i’ll do $100,000 job and be invoicing progress payments along the way and do not have the ability to invoice for percentage of the job that’s complete. it be nice to see that option in quickbooks online
good but............... this app needs to have a debit option when adding expenses. also i am really frustrated at this moment, because your app keeps crashing on my ipad. if theses 2 issues are fixed i would give it 10 stars
. after eading all the problems and seeing 90% of the reviews being 1 star im going to save a headache on this scam app should be taken off the market or sued for false advertising and costing people thousands of dollars. all the responses from support sound like they are prewritten for the complaints. please take app off the market and quit ruing the admin side of peoples hard work to start a business.
love itrepeat user. i love quickbooks because of the ease of getting things done in accounting. i am by no means an accountant but this does everything for me and i just hand it to my accountant at the end of the year which makes it so easy.
owner. useful for small business. able to use mobile app and coordinate with online.
useless app. used to a quickbooks user a couple of years ago, and it was ok then, but now i have recently returned and find it rubbish. a simple thing like adding a company address is turning out to be an impossible task. total waste of my time. it you are a small business using the app via iphone or ipad forget it. stay away
crashing at start up with ios 13. love this app but it crashes with ios 13 :( please fix
. its easy but the app needs work to be seemless. its not as userfriendly as the desktop version but for what i use it for its alright.
just tolerable. why limit the time going back to review past invoices? does not make sense.
awesome app... its amazing app and each update is awesome. but it's not as near the desktop in terms of functionality. overall, if you use quickbooks then its a must have..
very happy. i love this app for my business
qbo app. useless app, does not present a desirable layout compared to the the online version, in the banking area, to the bank register. somewhat comparable to using another account program.
. this is a great app for small businesses on the go. 👍👍
works great, but has quirks. i love the convienience of being able to access while on the go from my phone or tablet. i came over from using quickbooks 2013 on my desktop so there was a learning curve and you have to get used to the pause between transactions.
recent update. worked great until most recent update. can't create new invoices now. when you save it says it's saving but then just stops.
great for small business owners.. awesome app. very convenient and keeps the finances and work orders organized. takes some trial and error but well worth the effort to learn this system. you tube has many instructional videos on how to expedite learning this program. price is reasonable for what you get. don't hesitate to get it. if anything you will learn something.
not bad needs a little work. online is getting better with each update. i love the update with the option to deposit money in different accounts
cornered into online version. not an easy transition from desktop for contractor version. poor interface for entering time to bill for. hard to tell what time and materials i have not billed for. mobile interface is fairly limited.
awesome app. i was hesitant going to the monthly subscription, but it has been awesome always having access to my business account. the app looks and works just like the desktop app on my mac.
app doesn't connect on ios 9. ever since ios upgrade 9.3 and quickbooks mobile app doesn't sign in, always says check internet connection. it's a bug in the app and they know it, we contacted support to fix it and they said they are working on it and will have a solution by end of may. this problem has been on for more than 4 weeks with no solution. poor app with poor support. not recommended at all.
viewable. error message on download is gone, but the app lacks functionality like syncing bank data and the payroll app doesn't allow me employee editing options. if i need to see what is happening in quickbooks its all right, but it's definitely not quickbooks online mobile version
". the app will not sync to my quickbooks data. an error message appears. i am able to access my data online but not on the app. after 2 hrs on the phone with ""quickbooks"" i am left with ""we don't know"" and no solution in sight. i am a contractor and i use my phone or tablet to invoice etc. now i have all my accounting on quickbooks and can't use my phone or tablet to work it."
. this is what happens when a company gets too large. first app worked fine and then suddenly refuses to connect to my bank. customer service is a joke. reps were unable to figure out why error 103 kept appearing. after two hours on the phone i was then told it is a systems issue that needs its own ticket. two days later an email arrives stating that the issue is resolved. guess what, it wasn't!! come up intuit! you can do better than this
. quickbooks is perfect for managing your business expended and for generating invoices and receipts.
"convenient. having a small business can be challenging...a customer requested a copy of invoice to be resent from my office.... ""i have no office"".....downloaded d app and baam, job done....awesome!!!!!!"
love quickbooks hate new limited invoice styles update. love quickbooks hate new limited invoice styles update
great app!!. great app
. this app is simple and really easy to use. makes my job way easier.
pants app! does not refresh, to many glitches!. poor show on the app! creates more work for me then needed, stick to logging in online. far easier than trying to refresh the app manually, i'll get grey before i can do any accounting with this app!!
really good, but.... the app does everything i need it to, but the fact that it doesn't show up in the recent apps list makes it unusable for me. i like to copy paste from a emails, and receipts into the app, so not being able to quickly switch back to it from another app sucks. fix that and likely a 5 star.
ouch. does not have my bank listed. does me no good. been paying for 1 year now. and i see no where how to stop subscribing. cost me over $10.00 a month.
can't live without it. i don't know how i did business before this app. i love that i can access my company books anywhere. i love the way i can take a photo of the receipts for my expenses. thank you qb!
great app. great for on the go owners.
loving it. been hunting for a simple app for managing the finances of my farm business. this helps me with capturing and analysis of all my expenses and income. the reporting is also amazing. i also love the fact that i can even get more stats and reports via the web. amazing stuff. already introduced it to quite a number of industry colleagues. truly an amazing app
not useful yet. it is okay to check open balances and receive payments, but other than that, there is little functionality. qboa continues to improve, so i expect this app will improve as well.
good functionality but slow to load. great functionality, good app but it takes too long to load. i don't need the homescreen with current activity to load each time. i just want to add an invoice.
background usage accounts for 50 percent of battery life. this app completely drains my battery. i thought my battery was broken and was about to replace it, but apple tech report suggested i check on battery usage by app and i discovered quickbooks was the culprit.
design and functionality is poor. the pin code doesn't work. i have to refresh data most of the time. crashes a few times a week. trying to edit description or client info is a pain. here is another update ok the app. it says clients have paid invoice on my phone when they haven't app is frustrating to work with.
. this is a great app thus far!!!!!!!!
slow. very slow
it works ok. using this app for serval years now. mainly i’m bothered by the small glitches and performance of the app, not so much quickbooks. every so often a new annoyance will pop up.
great. amazing app but whoever did that last update screw it all up. can save estimate or invoices. horrible. i hope they refund at least a month of fees because i'm loosing money having to do all my estimatesinvoices at my house instead. needs to be fixed asap.
. works fine on my android phone (granted, i don't use it very often!) but it's 100% buggy in chromebook. i opened it, managed to add one banking item, then it froze. i opened it again, and it froze before i could even load current invoices. uninstalled. i'll keep using the web version
kiss. keep it simple stupid as they say, this app is brilliant, simple, easy to use a great for a small business that just wants everything in one app at their fingertips. well done team.
crashes on large invoice. works fine until you get a large invoice and then it slows down and or crashes
this product is fantastic!. i will be recommending this to all of my customers. it's simple, easy to use & fast to set up. in fact it may feel like you've missed something it's that simple! intuit have put together a great product for the australian market.
. really quick and simple set up. easy to use. no problems so far. perfect for a small business.
. clunky, ugly app with barely any features. there's no way to refresh your banking data within the app, though navigation and ux is so awful i maybe just can't find it. no consistent design standard throughout with multiple different menu types, navigation styles, presentation. almost no graphics, just pages of text. invoicing, expenses and tracking are all so horrible i'm forced to use the (also underwhelming) browser version. edit: the developers comment below doesn't work as of 130619
. i use this app while i had my quickbooks trial, and it seemed to be working fine. the minute i subscribed, the app stopped working properly. i emailed support, no one seems to be answering my questions, and when i phone the customer service, they don't know how to help with the app. i'm stuck and ready to cancel the whole thing.
. great app.
bad servise. have quikbook for 6 month and crash and phone them 10 times my account is on debit order also 5 days later they tell me there nothing they can do for my acount crash i must start over i wont recomended this app
. very slow. app doesnt update automatically. i have to manually update which takes forever for a relatively small number of changes to be downloaded. quite disappointed with it.
app is limited on what your can do. the app would be more helpful if i could categorize transactions while on the go among many other features the desktop version offers.
. lets try its beat for small business highly appreciated this app every must have to use it .
keeps me connected to my business. the qbo online app is a great compliment to qbo online when i am on the go and do not have access to my laptop or computer. i love the fact that i am always connected to my business even when i have only my mobile phone.
quickbooks online. great app. saves having to cart round invoice pads.
can't do much. among other things, you can't enter billable time. this would be my main use for this app.
not bad, not amazing. it's quick books. the app gives you access to some information, but not everything.
don’t bother downloading!. this app was so hard to use, wouldn’t connect to my bank, wasted so much time trying. brought up all of my personal accounts transactions even though i asked it to hide them. wouldn’t bring up transactions older than 3 months. i honestly don’t understand how anyone can use it!!!
good app. i have used this now for two years. it works well.
very good. excellent app that syncs with qbo.
quickbooks app. i like the app except i can’t seem to add accounts to the chart of accounts.
. this app is making my life life much easier!
a good start. i have 19 overdue invoices and quickbooks sent me 19 alerts about it, telling me i have 19 overdue invoices, all at the same time. how about sending 1 alert only?
needs purchase orders. work in the construction industry and the biggest nightmare is a po system. you can create them online but this app does not allow for po generation which is a huge draw back. if this could be added in it would be a 5 star but till that get added it's very limiting.
. quickbooks makes it so easy to keep track of expenses, invoices, payments, mileage... everything really. i'm glad i chose this over the other options.
qb app is awsome. i really like the options on the app. makes my business easy to run
simple and easy. great for keeping tabs on your business on the go
excellent app. keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
. doesn't work on my galaxy note 5
. a great app. for basic functions, app is good. for full functionality, use a desk top computer for acess for online quickbooks is better to use.
i like everything but..... i like qbo a lot. however there is at least one very big flaw and that is that you cannot make past due or partial tax payments through qbo.
. quickbooks technical support is very bad and technical support dont know about how to customised form of bill and showing in their theam but donot show in my bill how to solve it thay don't know ..... and my network speed is 5mbps but opening quick books need time 10  20 minutes to open ... i don't recommend any one for supscription or purchase .... this is a overall very slow software
. you will get no help from customer service. called 3 times. not one person could help me. i get error code 132.100. they didn't even know what it is. the answer they gave me is open it in desktop mode on my phone and use it from the browser. what is the point of having the app? i really like paying for software that i can't use. i will switch to freshbooks today 42819
. awesome app, does everything i need to operate a small business.
good. app.
improved quickbooks. it has many features than can help small businesses. the app can help you to organize, make use of spare time to do work.
horrible mobile support!. this app has a ton of problems and nobody at intuit cares to fix it. app won't load half the time, invoices do not show up, errors all the time, signature capture doesn't work, and no support available for the mobile app. the only thing they know is to tell you to uninstall and reinstall it which fixes nothing! if they don't get their issues fixed, i am switching!
good app. helps me run my business in paperless mode. crashes when i push terms while creating invoice or estimate. please fix this.
ios 13 crash. an awful app that is made even less useful in ios13 because it just crashes straight after running.
great tool. i use this (on my galaxy note 3) in conjunction with quickbooks online on my pc and my ipad. each device has different features available to use, and all three together make running my business quite simple to manage.
bank transactions not loaded. there are several limitations with this app. but my major issue is the inability to load bank transactions. the connected bank account goes sometimes for weeks or months without the transactions transferred to qb. other times they are uploaded every couple of days. there is no option to upload the transactions manually through the app. i called customer service but no one helped. this makes the phone app pretty much useless.
. desktop site works great, mobile site is trash and i can't even log into my account through app. says i don't have an account? okkkkk. tried reinstalling but no dice. i'll stick with the desktop site thanks
. so far this app is working very well for me and i have not had any problems as of yet
. wow isn't enough ... 100000 problems 1 sollution.. بتوفيق الله سبحانه وتعالى ... و برحمته و بفضله ... والحمد لله رب العالمين .. الخير كل من عند الله سبحانه و تعالى ...
. very user friendly and professional. huge asset to my small business.
. how do you create a new user. i have followed the instructions but can't create one, as their is no create button. i've tried on the phone app and i have tried on the laptop still now joy.
still slow & buggy. home page shows update date as current and. transactions to reconcile yet when i go to the individual accounts to do it the numbers are either wrong or transactions not there...
app shows incorrect transactions. transactions do not match the selected vendor. works when you have few transactions. once you pass 20k it becomes slow and inaccurate.
worked awesome until latest update. just says error every time i log in. worked great before update however.
. office on the go! i run a tree service so i'm never in the office. this app let's me take care of businesses while in the field and frees up time when i get home at night.
. love the mileage and receipt feature.
crashes since update. i've tried to create a twoline invoice repeatedly since the update, and it crashes every time. will update review when it works.
. a very good app for accounting. has made my life better.
great app!. very useful and convenient app.
customer service fail!. customer service is non existent look elsewhere
. best app ever i used
ok. updates updates and more updates. what’s worse, arriving to a job site and it updating over the cellular network while a customer waits for me to invoice them. no update and it will not work. the concept and functionality is fine.
fantastic app. the best bookkeeping app available. love this app. my bookkeeping has never been so up to date.
love it. this app works great for me.. .
rubbish. you’d expect better due to it having bank details, just want customers to get invoices & see that they’ve paid , quite embarrassing when it takes longer to open the app than do the job , very disappointing 😡
signature issues. the app crashes every time i get a signature or it doesn't save the signature. please resolve this issue. it has now been a week and this is still an issue.
crashes when entering a sales receipt. i am new to quickbooks and am super frustrated i can’t enter a simple sales transaction. it crashes every time. disappointing
works well!. this app does what i need it to do. i'm an electrical contractor and i'm able to do all the bookkeeping myself with just a little help. i like the ability to make invoices on the job, enter receipts at stores, and view the status of customers. i would suggest this for any small business. i use the basic service ($10mth) and it's well worth it.
doesn’t work on ios13. hoping for another update as it doesn’t work on ios13
doesn't work for ipad. this app doesn't even load my company info. it keeps returning error trying to load company info. i have contacted quickbooks a number of times and all they say is they are working on the issue and to use a web browser version in the mean time. i have seen about 4 updates released and not one of them has fixed this issue. when will this be fixed?
. i can see my subscription for months. click to manage subscription and i am told i have none. haven't used thus app but have been paying for months. help
why doesn't it update banking?. all i want to do is import my banking transactions and deal with them. i would think this would be basic functionality. i spent spent over half an hour on the phone with support and talked to 3 different reps who ll claimed to know almost nothing about the app. seriously, why do you even have it.
. the worst customer service ever. i would give them zero.
. solved my problem with today's update patch... thanks quickbooks team 👍

deposit entry?. big thing i'm not seeing is a way to enter straight deposits that don't involve billing someone. i am the treasurer for a church and it would be helpful if i could enter the deposit amount for the weekly contribution (we don't use pledging or planned giving or anything like that, so we don't track individual giving) in the mobile app.
. best software
. enjoying this app, life made easy...
. can't upgrade... even with tech support's help they can't figure out how to make it work. after writing this review support contacted me and managed to upgrade.
love it!. qb is stunningly simple yet superbly sufficient to handle our business needs for invoicing clients, reporting ar and preparing us for yearend taxes. the mobil app is equally impressive!
. nice niceeee
. a really good platform for small business. the program is user friendly and has a great online help community and customer service.
. haven't been able to access my books since early september, can only use desktop app, browser and mobile app gives error message. contacted support 4+, engineers are working on known problem...10 weeks and counting
. uninstalled right away, seems like a phishing app to me. it requires you to log on to their server. i can't trust my financial information to a 3rd party i know nothing about.
buen contador. tiene muchas herramientas para hacer toda tu contabilidad.
not worth it. the limited functionality does not justify the cost. the app should be free if you have the full desktop program. definitely not worth paying for both.
not happy with new update. new update has made navigating to the chart of accounts very annoying. you have to access one of 3 accounts (determined by qbs) that show up on the main page and then push the back button, magically the accounts list appears. poor design, but a simple fix. i don’t mind that the menu button has moved to the bottom, just please add a “chart of accounts” link. thanks.
. great even w limited functions i love this ap which allows us to do estimates out in the field and create new customers. we had lost a lot of valueable information because we didn't have a convenient system for integrating that info into our accounting system. i would love to see more functions added to the ap but right now it has improved our workflow and info management.
. great software !!!
love the app. very fast an easy
recurring payments.. i really wish i could set up recurring payments from the app and also delete invoices
. good value for money, easy to use most the time. only frustration is needing to be online when using and in our area we haven't got a good connection.
"disappointed.... i had high expectations for this app., but it just doesn't deliver. half the features advertised return a message ""feature not supported at this time, please log on from a computer""! so what's the point? why not just not release the app until it works? looking for another option."
everything i need. the quickbooks app has met every one of my needs for my small handyman business. i love the ability to email customers estimates, invoices, and sales receipts while i am standing there with them. i have only been using the app for a little over a month but i feel good about my decision to go with quickbooks online.
reduced feature set. previous version:the feature set of the web based app is not matched. (previous mentioned currency and time records). update: removed a lot of preexisting functionality and did not add any missing functions. much worse than before. cannot find a list of invoices due to a supplier. clicking on a particular supplier brings up only the address particulars.
charge for an expense???. can't even include an expense on an invoice. rubbish !!!!
please make it work with desk top. great app wish it worked with the desk top version
where is the expense part of the app?. i want to take a photo of receipts in android app and upload! where is it? my husband can do it from his iphone, but my samsung s4 doesn't have an expense button with the camera etc..,
iphone 11 fail. can’t get this app open on new phone. was never a problem before!
. how do i quote in this app?
. good user friendly
"about 710. not bad but not good. the app keeps requiring updates if used on apple products. not an issue but the updates never appear. quickbooks blames apple and apple blame quickbooks. we ""updated to the cloud version"" from a pcm based quickbooks. so far we are very very disappointed."
terriblw. the sync between the data entered on the desktop and data entered in the mobile app is terrible.. half of the time it doesn't work
great, but can learn from others. just my observations: mobile app should be mostly used to record expenses. it lacks ocr tracing. moreover scanning a receipt is a multistep process. should add forcetouch to add receipt (open in camera). invoices: been searching how to add my banking information. cannot believe quickbooks does not allow for adding banking information to invoices. did i miss something? or is it a hidden feature? not very intuitive (pun intended). otherwise good. like the integration with bank account.
. great app for small businesses
. really good for simple operations i only needed the app for a small subset of operations.... that is, quickly open,edit, and send an invoice. i am thankful for that capability. perhaps intuit could stress that the app is not intended to be full blast qbo.
decent. if there was a crash course in it, it could be the best app but it still gets the job done 😁
work in progress, work not yet completed. very convenient and functional tomorrow to add expenses and receipts on the go. however only expenses not bills or other random transactions can be accessed through the mobile app. hoping intuit sees the feedback and that all transactions available including bills to be accessed on the mobile app.
. simple to use and good value. love the app!
great app, slow to make revisions. app works good 98% of the time, there are some things that i would change and they do not seem to be changing them
excellent program. i am so impressed with this new app, it is very easy to use and very helpful for my construction business. i don't even have to go to the office to make an invoice i can do it right in my truck on my phone and send it. i can check on expenses... it's a breeze and worth the time to get to know this app and online program.
. was wary, but the convenience is worth a lot until the latest update. now i cant sign on. been a week since they told me there was an issue. still not resolved. spent several hours on hold listing to garbled elevator music that can not be turned down. customer support blows.
. lovely app.
me. quite useful for quick insight of status of company's books.
love the qbo. mobile expense posting is cool
much better. used qbo several years ago and it was horrible. this is a really nice app. good job intuit.
great product. i used the desktop version for windows for years and love it but with this it is so much easier and faster and i'm in love with the online version!!!!!
. does what i need it to do.
only us users. only support for us companies. what about the nonus users?
. i love the simple features on the app.
poor implementation. need more of desktop features and views.. poor implementation. need more of desktop features and views. can't print packing slips. needs a simple overview page.
keeps getting better. interface much improved and good to have access to bank transactions.
"awful app... can't even sign in. migrating to qb online so thought app would be great.. wrong! app won't sign in and reports 'communications error' in addition, it's not compatible with my 8"" tablet running android 5x  come on intuit  sort it out"
. i like it. i came across a bug at the start but i called quickbooks and they resolved it the next day thankfully
perfect for small businesses!. i have a growing cleaning company and thus app is perfect for me!
. simple to navigate
great to use on the go!. love this app. i use it alongside the website, this is on my phone. it's not as easy to navigate around as the website but it's not intended to use totally on its own. i love being able to send invoices whilst doing other things  really helps me to consolidate my time.
wish it had outlook. awesome app. i wish i could send emails through outlookhotmail instead of gmail. if there is a fix please advise.
. this is my first year using quickbooks. so much easier to track all expenses and sales.
cool app. i would have given it 5 stars, but it just doesn't have the power that i'm used to with the real quickbooks, but it's ease of use and functionality is still great for a new app.
. edit 12319: thanks for the fix and newer versions. this app has been updated and expanded to be a powerful tool on the go. crash problem fixed. love qbo i love that this app is a limited version of the qbo for your desktop browser: however, it crashes on start up all the time rendering it useless.
awful!. this latest update is awful! i have had nothing but problems saving notes and attachments. plus it looks really weird! i like the previous version much better, it actually worked! thanks for messing up a perfectly good product!
. sales receipt and invoice not round off available in mobile apps create invoice not show retail invoice and tax invoice in mobile i am a paid version user and i am pc login all options are work properly but mobile apps issue i have made complete 4 tims in call center but agent ask me team work this issue
quickbooks app. organization, taxes and everything! quickbooks really helps you run a full business.
. have been using this app for quickbooks online, an amazing interface.
love this app. qbo is indispensable in running my business.
fair app version, but not good as browser version. i’m not able to select item groups when creating an invoice. also im not able to enter sku when creating an item. neither im able to search items by sku info... they dont let you set a fixed price for an item group on any version of the software which o find really easy to implement by code which is dumb...
. since a few updates ago when fingerprint sign in was introduced, i've had problems with mileage logging never logs it properly and data is never saved 😡
awesome app. helps with all business expenses and just great interface
. great app.
. was working awesome until last update. now won't log in. just has that loading thing come up forever
fantastic. it's so handy to have quick books with me wherever i go! i can balance my bank register, create invoices and take payments on the go.
i need support no one available. i need support trying to do payroll but no one at qb is available. not a very good way to run this business!
getting better with every upgrade.. great app. they do lure you with the free use then hit ya with the charges later. i think it's a useful tool in the toolbox.
excellent resource. this app is a great resource to both me and my clients. so much instant functionality at your fingertips.
banking. great app just the banking doesn’t always pull over on fist couple tries to load transactions
. cant send invoices via email like we used to. needs work. it really put us in a bad spot.
nifty. the app won't do everything the website does, but it's a handy tool for when you're out and about.
gret app. i love this app but the reason i didn't give it a 5 is because when you enter an expense with the app and write who you paid and save the expense when you go to the computer it does not show who you paid. that field is blank.
great. does everything i need it to do onsite. kinda wish it looked more like the tablet version though
. qb online good, but feels really limited in comparison to the webapp in terms of available functions and data sync is slow, even over 4g lte. more of a qb issue. great platform, but could improve.
unhappy. bad program for ipad and android phone. bad customer service. very dissatisfied.
great timesaver. i used the free app and i have made up my mind that i will be purchasing this for my small construction business.
fairly good . . . but. i can't believe they offer milage tracking with the intro version, but as soon as you up grade to a more powerful version it is dropped. i need this option too and now have to go to a completely different app to record milage. that is a real waste of my time.
. keeps crashing when entering receipts. it's infuriating. updated review 6 months later still crashes when splitting an expense. tried deleting the cache. it's useless.
i love this quickbooks!!. it makes my life easier and helps me with my taxes. just a few clicks and a email and my tax guy has all he needs
bookkeepers or better only! too much info available to users.. this app would allow a salesman taking orders to view way too much information. it's nice that it integrates with the qbo program, but what am i supposed to do about salesmen that only need to check inventory and write orders? surely they should be excluded from the company books! very disappointed in the time i wasted talking to intuit salespeople who materially misrepresent the functionality of the program
great. amazing app but whoever did that last update screw it all up. can save estimate or invoices. horrible. i hope they refund at least a month of fees because i'm loosing money having to do all my estimatesinvoices at my house instead. needs to be fixed asap.
user friendly. this app is so nice when i am out and about getting good items for our business i can input them right then and there. i don't have to come home a do it, sometimes i forget then i get unorganized and have missing receipts that i later find. i love this app.
. not bad unable to upload historical data really hurts this app.
not good support. the app is ok, but if you require support, it is not there.
"problems. this app will not let me save an invoice, it always says ""this number already exists"" no matter which number i add. only started the error on the 301112, please fix."
ios 13 and later app crashes. the app works well prior to ios 13.0 when opened in an iphone running ios 13 later, the app crashes after faceid login.
again. after running smoothly for couple months, again a problem! now whenever i try to work from customers tab, it crashes....
great for invoices on the go. being able to do estimates and have it linked with the office is great.
. excellent for mobile businesses, only wish that i could see the same dashboard as on the pc version.
doesn’t work. app won’t open and website is unresponsive. not very impressed with the program.
wonderful app!!!. couldn't sing the praises high enough. i run a small, single member managed llc and the quickbooks online app is everything i need. i can create and send invoices and sales receipts on the go, even have the customer sign right on my iphone or ipad.
owner of superior insulation. love this app its great
. at some point the app stopped attaching photo receipts to my expenses. now i've lost several months worth of receipts.
so glitchy!! 😡. quickbooks has the potential to be great. but this app is so, so glitchy! have constant problems with it and i'm really getting to the point of giving up and going back to sage. every time a problem is sorted, a new one pops straight back up. if they could employ some decent tech guys and get things working properly, this would be brilliant.
please update to support iphone x. please update to support iphone x
“updates”. every time i go to do something the app says it has to log me out to run updates. getting sick of typing my password constantly. (literally 100% of the time i try and use the app.) pretty much just use the website these days.
works perfect. i enjoy using qb it allows me to send invoices from where ever i'm at also i can except payments from the field. it's been awesome to run my small business for 2 years.
better than sage. with a properly functioning mobile app, square integration & receiptexpense management, 10 times easier to use than sage(simply accounting)
"confusing and cluttered app. i love that nearly all of the features in the desktop app are here in the mobile app. however the interface, especially the home page, is confusing and cluttered. ""company activity"" is a bit useless as the default page. show me the charts of paidunpaid invoices. i think the developers are tasked with including every single feature and that clouds their design judgement. it's not an easy ask but let's make this app more mobile friendly."
. so far not happy. it doesn't show my address nor phone number on quotations and i can't find a way to make it do so. also states 30 day free, then gives me a measly 24 hrs from the time of install to save with a monthly discount. ok, i'll bite. they immediately sucked my first monthly payment. where's this 30 day free trial? biggest thing is its extremely limited and not ready for prime time. poor release.
amazing!!!. i love the fact that i can take a pic of a source document, it it will convert it into pdf file and attach it to the transaction! and i can do pretty much everything in bookkeeping from my iphone!
great companion app to the main qbo. i like this app a lot. it really helps run my business and to continually update my main desktop app.
for on the go. this app works amazing for exactly what is it built for, on the go.
disappointed. i just switched from my trusty iphone to an android phone, this app on my iphone was perfect! it had a list of products and services, unlike the android version. it also loaded all the estimates and invoices for all my customers, this android version hardly has any of my past transactions! please make this like the ios app!
not bad. i like it. quickly to make and send invoices. the worst problem is not possible to transfer data. need small improvements ..
. what a faff! absolute joke, can't create items on android useless
bank transfers take too long. i am very frustrated. it has been 1 week since my clients paid their invoice and the money still is not in my bank account after 1 week. unacceptable!
supper great and easy. this is a time saver app
brilliant. brilliant app. so happy that i've migrated over to quick books.
. have had an issue with sending invoices through my app for the last 3 days. even after several calls and emails no one can tell me when this will be rectified. poor support and unorganized for such a large company.
. terrible. does not recognize my company credit card as a credit card, add o i couldn't add expense charged to it. doesnt recognize my cash account from my chart of accounts for when i tried to apply a cash receipt. clearly not ready for prime time.
. i use to love quickbooks but now it's not working anymore. please fix immediately because my whole business is run on this app... are you gonna fix this?
. doesn't open, tried reinstalling and clearing cache. used to work.
ok but. reasonably happy with it but so many of my customers are also suppliers so i really would like an entity database where an entity could be both a customer and a supplier rather than having separate customer and supplier databases which necessitates the creation and therefore data entry for the same entity twice.
crashes a ton. this is a great app for bookkeeping for my business, but it crashes almost daily on my iphone. please get better engineers for the functionality of this app!! so frustrating when i’m in the middle of printing invoices and the app crashes! how am i supposed to conduct business that way!?!
great app. works well for small to medium size businesses on the go!
. great app.
. this app works really good makes owning a service business simple. love that i can get done at a customers house and send an invoice
love it.. i love this app it is very convenient and works so nice when i'm on the run for quick access
need packing slip option. add the option to send packing slips from the mobile app
mobile app. convenient and easy too use!
. not fully fledged it's great but doesn't do much nor the basic things i would want in an app.. basic reporting, easy input of invoice (picture maybe ocr), accepting account transactions.
. great app! very affordable. quick to uload and edit inventory items.
actually makes accounting a little bit fun. i absolutely love the way this app allows me to record, photograph and categorise expenses from receipts. so easy that it actually is fun. delighted that i can get rid of all this paper!
no date field in invoice line items?. i have asked many times and still haven't seen a date field in the invoice line items. you have it on the online version but can't access it from these applications so these applications are basically freaking worthless to me!
too many glitches. i love quickbooks and i love that they have an app but there are a lot of glitches in the performance. the screen goes blurry, logs you completely out of the system inconveniently, customer list is unlined with the screen, there are more but minor.
. love this app, keeps track of all my expenses and payments from clients. easiest way to do estimates and invoices as well.
allsecuresysyems. love this app. works great!
. great app. makes it easier to run my business
. i like the relatively seamless access from desktop, internet and mobile app
crashes and fails. it crashes, it fails and it's not as good as invoice2go sadly.
simple things just don’t work in this app.. now i can’t copy my password from my password safe into the quickbooks login. this means i will have to use a simple easy to use and less secure password. also, there is no way to enter check numbers into the bank transactions. this works fine on a mac and online but not in the ipad app. these simple problems make the ipad app almost useless.
great app for every business. i have only played with this app a little to see what it can do, it is a great app for any service business, it automaticly updates all the records when you make a sell or a purchase. perfect if you are bad about keeping up with paperwork, this app will help u do it all as you go.
. can't view financial report when i use android phone, could you fix it?
limited compared to quickbooks desktop. quickbooks online is just ok. it has some limits that did not exist in the desktop version. a lot of them have to do with assisted payroll. for example, the app does not tell you each pay period how much of a contribution to pay towards simple ira's and give you a chance to indicate whether they were paid. it just assumes it was done without giving you any notice. other limitations make it just ok.
great app. removed and reinstalled the app on my iphone. works fine
love it!. i am a locksmith, need an easy and efficient easy to manage invoicing, books, transactions... qbo has saved me hours every night logging and sending invoices, billing, and balancing my books through my bank. i send invoices on the fly now, and all of the related bookwork is completed simultaneously... seriously wonder how i found the time to complete everything this does for me from my phone or tablet in my car. a real time saver!
crash error crash error. quickbooks is a four outta five platform, this app is a one... signs me out and crashes more than once a day!
great app. this is a brilliant app till date..i m using this app and mange my whole business through this app.thanks a lot
was great and then they updated it. i loved this app when i first got it. i used it all the time for 5 months strait, and then they 'updated' it. now, it's awful. i don't see any of the new features and it is buggy beyond belief. please go back to the older version. this is a joke.
can’t use properly  soooo slow. i can’t use qbo app properly, the application is so slow, unable to load my data on my mobile (wifi lte network)
very good. very good and easy app.
. crashes every time. hasn't opened successfully once. tried reinstalling and restarting tablet.
great. great for small businesses. only thing i'd like is for ability to update bank accounts through the ios app.
". i scanned several receipts and submitted them through the app. they were confirmed by the app as ""added"". half of them are now missing with no explanation of where they went. those receipts were already disposed of. completely unacceptable."
. we are really enjoying the convenience of this app
. i had an inapp issue and received help immediately. i love this app and really appreciate you guys. you make my life a lot easier, 💯💯
love it so easy on the go. great support of an easily understood ap! perfect for my on road small horse business thanks
. won't let me add bank accounts. app is useless.
easy for small business. especially for a business in another location
ouickbooks. setting up this quickbooks app is a joke , the system does not work and customer support has an attitude that is not willing to help!
app is almost useless for me.. the only reason i upgraded to quickbooks on line was so that i could do estimates and invoicing on site. this app will allow me to do an estimate but will not let me do a partial invoice. if i can’t do a partial invoice on the app it’s simply a waste of time for my small fencing business.
loved it indeed. this app works the way i think, i'm considering useing it in my next business. thanks
sloooooooowwwww!!! iphone 6. very slow to do simple things like log an expense. camera feature is useless with crop feature. can i have the option to turn this off? just wanna take a photo without auto crop which 90% does a bad job. other than that its great :)
app is satisfactory  quickbooks online is not. i am very unhappy with quickbooks online. if you are anything more then a landlord of one rental property, then you will find quickbooks online to be greatly underwhelming. it is clunky, glitchy, and virtually void of any mechanism for customizing the program. it is not a replacement for quickbooks desktop. perhaps after a few years of unfortunate beta testers abandoning quickbooks online it will get better. for now, though, don't do it.
love the app. it is amazing to see how well the app learn how to categorize expense! the design and ui are also amazing!
a good idea but not very useful yet. there is not access to the important online reports. there is no access to fx transactions or accounts in a foreign currency. i live overseas and bill my clients in us dollars and as such have no access to client information or us dollars sales and accounts. if the app mirrored the online program it would be great but it doesnt!!
awesome app. feature rich and also user friendly
great app. makes life easy. one addition will make it perfect. add journal entry to the app.
. very close to cancelling my subscription as app doesn't work. after adding 45 receipts i get an error message that my request cannot be added and i should call customer support. have tried reinstalling clearing cache signing out and nothing works permanently very frustrated
. super easy to use. simple and efficient. perfect small a smallside business.
user friendly but. this program is extremely user friendly and makes book keeping easy for small business owners but the cost of doing payroll for employees is extremely expensive. i have 5 employees and it costs way to much for me to use quickbooks 👎
easy & convenient. love how easy it is to navigate the menu and do my business away from the computer.
highly recommend this app. i have a mobile veterinary service and use this for all of my billing while i'm on the road. it saves me time by allowing me to bill my clients on site at the time of service, and even process the credit card if they choose to pay that way.
. little slow to open, all in all does what i expected. good for use out of the office.
.. i had to delete the app as it was having many issues. now i can't download it again?
keeps getting more user friendly!. the new video tutorials make it easy to learn. the portability of switching between the mobile app and the desktop version online is a priceless feature, thanks for all of your hard work!
the app needs work. the web based service is great, but the app needs work. the tool i need (journal entries) are not available through this app, so it's not very useful.
invoice won’t work with ios 13. i’m trying to put a new customer in on a invoice and the app just turns black and white screen. plz update! i run my entire business off this app
. great app
esd works well needs one more feature. works well for the features that it offers could be better with if it included pictures for invoice transfer to portfolio
love qbo it's fantastic.. this app rocks. i can see they are adding more features.
does not support multiple currencies. hope they can add multiple currencies soon. it's useless if you have a primary currency other than usd.
really good, works seamlessly. great for book keeper and employees. very user friendly and a pleasure to use and recommend
login will not allow me to paste my password. i use quickbooks online, so i use a very strong password that is stored in an app (1password). it would be extremely annoying to hand type a 25 character random password into this app. and i'm unwilling to compromise my security for my online financial data. therefore this app is totally useless to me.
2016 update is a headache. much improved after initial deterioration in poor updates. great software now. real time accounting is brilliant. l
. this app makes my business more efficient!
mr. nice app
. love the flexibility of using the app in keeping the business running.
powerful. very good, gives almost all of the functionality as the browser version except for splitting and journal entries. but for daily review and acceptance of linked electronic transactions, this is great! also has a good p&l and balance sheet report.
. how do we upload multiple files on app? thanks.
terrible app...... terrible app it does not work. since last update👿
awesome, powerful app. we've been using quickbooks for years, this app allows us to take all our bookkeeping at our finger tips
. it is very easy to use and it allows me to keep track of invoicing estimate and banking
makes business happen!. this powerful app makes my business happen! very easy to make sales on the go and keep track of all my ins and outs. thank you!
. can't view emails that it sends, it doesn't track when reminders are sent on past due invoices, you can not offer multiple terms (i.e. invoice net 30 but offer a net 15 discount if they pay early). tech support wait times are extensive (40 min on one call, 20 min on a chat). all that and it's expensive.
. doesn't connect to all bank accouns. some of us don't have the opportunity of the standard high street back account due to various issues in our pasts. i have tried to connect a cashplus business account and it isn't supported.
so helpful. my business is basically my husband and me. when we are both out of the office, it's been difficult to have to wait to help customers. this app has allowed me to to create an invoice from an estimate, accept payment and send a receipt all from the truck!
. no major issues with the app. handy when scanning receipts.
personal accountant. brilliant softwareyou need to allow yourself a couple of hours to set up but once done it does all your reporting for you and keeps your finger on the pulse with your financial status  i love it!
. great app for managing a small business!
. app takes forever to load on my one plus 5t. will not load banking feed to organize payment catagories. man, for how much we pay for this service, you would think it would have a rocking app....
needs more. needs way more functionality. too few procedures allowed on mobile app. would have expected more from quickbooks
. great app, love that i don't have to write a note to bill someone or change something later. i can do it right after i hang up or deliver an order. still learning all the options. it's not always as straightforward as i'd like, but a couple clicks and i can figure my way around to where i want to go.
. where a brand new bakery, and this has been great! we can quickly do invoices and get paid. our bookkeeper especially loves this!
exactly what i need. the app combined with the online system does exactly what i need it to do. i can invoice clients as soon as i've left their premises, no more trying to keep a record and doing the paperwork later. invoice matching and bank data feeds make reconciliation so easy. this has reduced the amount of time i spend on my accounts significantly. goodbye sage, hello qb online. happy customer.
saves so much time. i got this app to help save time and it does. it took awhile to set up and i have had to phone for help a few times and they have been fab. i can send invoices and receipts form my phone. i am able to keep up to date on my accounts without the effort.
. after eading all the problems and seeing 90% of the reviews being 1 star im going to save a headache on this scam app should be taken off the market or sued for false advertising and costing people thousands of dollars. all the responses from support sound like they are prewritten for the complaints. please take app off the market and quit ruing the admin side of peoples hard work to start a business.
why so many permissions. this is a great app but it does not need to access my photos not my conacts, etc. as it is our privacy is getting invaded i don't want other apps to access anything more than what it should.
love this app. efficient
okay. i'm new to doing my own bookkeeping and find this product clunky and not very easy to use. issues with importing transactions and program changing dates and the order compared to the bank. it's not very easy to see what account transfers are moving tofrom. it's hard to distinguish credits for debits. poor customer service. no good summary graphs. slow to attach receipts. multiple clicks to do basic things. cuts off file names if there too long.
quick books app. absolutely love this app, its works fabulously well on my iphone. my only gripe with the app and it's operations is that not all of my customer emails that are sent are being received by my customers. i have highlighted this to quickbooks and they were extremely unhelpful in assisting with rectifying this matter, which i found extremely disappointed given this is a paid subscription service, and not a free service.
. amazing. intuitive. simple to use. love it.
great app!. great app!
. on the go always..this app helps me stay on the go!!
app fails to load on iphone x. failed to start in iphone 6s and iphone x
good for review but limited functionality. this is a subset of qb online functions good for quick checking on the business but not a working system much like the ipad version of word or powerpoint you get to do a bit but need the full version for the program to be useful
. great app. makes paperwork a lot easier.
no purchase orders. for years now quickbooks has withheld the ability to create purchase orders through the mobile app. this is a huge issue for our company and it is quite frustrating that qb has willfully omitted this feature. i wish there was a way to convince qb to change course on this decision...
makes life easier!. helps me keep record of everything from invoices, payments customers and expenses.
. awesome app this helped me increase my efficiency by a big margin
way too limited. i can’t even use the app to see if a bill was processed. it only allows you to view check or ach transactions and deposits. checks processed through bill pay don resigister as activity.
. square app is so much easier to navigate on mobile app. plus square has instant deposit. quick books i have to wait 2 buisness days at the least. horrible.
best mobile accounting app. great improvements in the latest version. easily the best ipadiphone app for accounting, that sits well alongside the full featured qbo software.
. it's not perfect yet, but does what i need invoices and sales receipts in the field that i can print with my mobile printer. the recording part isn't as good as my desktop version but i know with time it will be improved.
this app is useless on android.. i can not believe that this app is this bad. i can only see customers invoices that i have been to in last 2 months. i use to be able to see 10 years worth of invoices. please fix asap. unless you can carry a laptop at all times which is not practical this again is useless.
very disappointed. there is very little you can actually do with the app.. not impressed am canceling the account.
great app !. great app
excellent!!!. i just love this app. i has allow me to invoice and collect payment at the point of sale without the paper work fuzz. it has allow me to improve my cash flow while increasing my efficiency while i am in the field. my only regret, i should have implemented much sooner into my mobile service.
even worse after last update. didn't think the time loading could get any worse. i was wrong. ap is pretty much useless while with a customer. everything takes forever to load. need to sign in every. single. time. then you click out of the ap and right back in and it makes you use the touch id. super sucky. i very much dislike, yet i need to use it everyday. ugggggggg.
"don't download latest version!!. software was great before the latest update. now, no more touchid support, no ability to email invoices. we all remember what apple did with the maps mess, i wonder if intuit will have the testicular fortitude to ""can"" the person who attempted to update the already good software?"
. great app
messed up. this program really stinks downloaded my accounts and it got all my accounts wrong
amazing. it is a great app. so powerful i can do my full estimate and invoice and the best feature entering in my receipts for expenses and it's so easy!
grateful for this software. i have an easy time figuring it out. overall i like this app. thanks would like to have a few other features like an easy way to delete mistakes. 102014. the customer support and tech support is awesone! fast, accurate and efficient! thank you.
touch id does not work. i have it checked and yet when i load the app it keeps asking for password. pointless, just remove touch id as an option since it does not work as it should.
. just was on hold for 20 minutes and the issue is not resolved. the app is not allowing me to save information. also the online platform is not working with third party apps with the new tax rates in saskatchewan (reciept bank) been waiting for that fix for 3 weeks.
. everytime i try to log in i get an error! i've restarted and uninstalled and it still won't work
. user friendly
. do not purchase this app!!!!!!!!!! you can never upgrade. to upgrade, you need to cancel account and reenter all data in upgraded version. purchase only direct from quickbooks not the play store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! if purchasing from quickbooks, you can upgrade as your business grows
limited, extremely. i need to be able to edit inventory on a regular basis, add it, etc. please continue to improve. good for reference on the road, but if i have to do any changing, i gotta break out my laptop... i'm on a galaxy note4.
. often doesn't work. customer service tells me not to use the app, to access account from web browser. the numbers you get there may be undependable. don't trust it.
. i can not accomplish anything in the app, a blank screen comes up no matter what category i try to go to.
my business has transformed.. i have received multiple compliments from my customers regarding my new invoices and estimates.
. it works great on my phone, and tablet. i'd recommend it to other people that use quickbooks if it could be used. i use it constantly, but would use it all the time with a tablet. it sometimes has issues with launching. i've had reinstallrelaunch several times.
pretty good could be great. this ties in nicely with the desktop version. it's not 5* purely because of the actual software not the app itself. the customising of the invoice isn't great and adding previous invoices when you first start isn't great but if you're not worried about that it works well!
disappointed. the app on iphone is murch better. this app doesn't enable me to take pictures of recipes. very limited. needs to be more like the iphone app
. good accounting software. use it mainly for invoices.
. every invoice i have done since the beginning of 2017 says 90 plus days past due
very good app. in general very good app. missing key features like banking, updates etc.
. this website is terrible and the customer service is friendly yet not helpful!!! i want to cancel my subscription and yet told to remove the app from my tablet....wrong by removing the app it does not cancel my subscription...very unhappy!!
the application for the tablet. the application for my ipad tablet does not let me see checks i have written that have not cleared. (it does show my account balance) i like the online version but i for the life of me don’t know why the internet based application does not work on my ipad plus and their application for ipads is simply said  horrible.
newest update. loved the app until the newest update. now for some reason i can no longer receive payments from my phone. which is very frustrating. i have closed out the app, restarted my phone and still can't do it.
. great app
please fix me. ios 13 ijust upgrade cannot write items into invoices
. the app does awesome it keeps me organized and constantly lets me know what i'm spending my money on. it has helped me better manage my money
amazing app!!!!. love quickbooks and also the app. excellent layout design. just one thing is needed. please allow the app to support touchid for the login process. this would be just the best update ever! thanks
makes my job so much easier. simple enough to use but detailed enough to get the job done.
great for my business. this app has been an absolute vital part in helping me run my business. i love it!
mr. the problem with quick books on line is that you can't choose what account a payment is credited to when using an ipad or iphone. it automatically placed it in to an undeposited account and then you have to log on to quick books using a pc and transfer it over to the desired account. for example current account. basically you do the work twice and defeats the option of doing accounts on the go.
rcborkert. so far this is a good program. a bit pricey. maybe they will make a better deal at the end of the term (year)
. excellent easy to use, logical app. saves me loads of time
disaster. was forced to use qb online due to always changing fees for desktop version. always crashes. hard to use. terrible. wish i could use another program. new version has new colours!! yay so practical!! doesn’t accommodate qc payroll deductions like cssnt but that’s ok, it’s colourful. intuit idiots.
. good app. allows me to do all things necessary for my business on the go
useless. unless i am missing something i find this app absolutely useless. it does not show all of my accounts, so i can't see the account balances. supplier balances also don't show, if i need to play a supplier. it still needs a lot of work, so i will stick with using my macbook until then. it's actually not even worth using.
. having issues with the app and no help!
extremely limited. no credit memos, you can't have a simple addition of how much you have to receive in open invoices at a specific date, no journal entries. i have only my ipad pro and if i try to access the web version, it's not compatible with any browser on ios. so you're stuck and you need a pcmac only for these things. it's a terrible, terrible experience.
perfect for small bussines. utilisation simple et prix aceptable.
". the information syncs between the app & the quickbooks online because it's all saved in the ""cloud"". i used a more primitive system before this and wasn't sure how it would work, but i must say that i wish i'd done it years ago. i love quickbooks online. the desktop version is a bit easier to use, so i input from there and access the information whilst i'm out on my phone. it's really easy to resend invoices or quotes whilst i'm out. awesome!"
buggy ios13. error email too long amount to high invoice can't add customers via contact address book goes dark probably a lot of other issues .
zero stars. another worthless update. now you have to login every freakin time i set my phone down and of course invoicing a customer with a credit still doesn't synchronize correctly and has never. if you're looking for an accounting system please shop around before getting tangled up in this company. i've been waiting for that call from tech support for 5 years lololol. why do you keep trying to fix what isn't broken. 21517 latest updates are a constant crash.
. signed up 6 days ago for self employed package, although it says in the package i can use the app, when opening the app it states i have not signed up for it... emailed asking for help, no reply. scheduled a call back for tuesday 13pm, noone called. poor customer service. i will cancel and find another accountancy program.
really bad app. this app is really bad, lacks everything you would want from a app that is suppose to work with you online quick books. no registry access!
. after upgrading to lg g6 the app no longer works. can't even get it to load. reinstalled, rebooted still nothing.
small bussines tool. perfect! for on people with small businesses that are on the go. this app makes my life easier! i totally wish it was cheaper!
awesome accounting app. it's user friendly. moreover, tutorial videos are available if have any difficulty.
. love the phone app!
stop downloading.. i have redone load company data every time i log on the app which can take hours, and essentially makes the apps convenience useless.
easy. i can't believe how easy this app is to use!
not sure yet. too early to rate this app. only second time me using it. ill check back in a couple of months with a more thought out opinion.
". was a good app. now it will not exit upon entering an expense. upon entering all the info and clicking ""save"" it stays on the same screen. if you hit save 5 times thinking it's not working it saves the expense 5 times. you have to back out and click don't save the transaction but it will be there. intuit  please fix it."
linked bank account. locked out. no customer service.. there is literally no phone support whatsoever for the mobile app. i'm still locked out of this app after linking my checking account.
so easy.. i love using this app, it is a lot easier than the online webpage version. i love it.
convenient mobile dashboard. very convenient mobile dashboard allows quick status of all my invoices.
. the app is unusable and highly inferior to the web interface. when you create an invoice, it always defaults to retail invoice without the facility to change to tax invoice, so i'm forced to use the web interface for invoicing. suppliers activity always shows a blank page so again need web interface to view suppliers balance, expenses etc. can't you people make a decent app ?
not user friendly. it’s hard to fill all boxes as do on pc. not user friendly. it’s hard to fill all boxes as do on pc.
logs me off all the time. every single day this app automatically logs me out, displays a message that there’s been a critical update, and that i need to log in again. even worse it requires you to actually enter the password rather than allowing face id authentication.
perfect for construction guys. i'm always running from job to job and the mobility to give estimates and invoice is on the spot is priceless... plus the customizable terms for each buildercustomer with the added alerts helps me stay on top of receivables
easy and friendly. so far i am enjoying the app and it's easy to understand platform
michael. great for my business nice to alter estimates and convert to invoice on the job, why do you need acsess to phone and gps
update needed asap. i also have been using this app for years (it’s great when working properly) but something happened after this last update and i’m getting kicked off and signed out in the middle of my invoices and estimates. it’s staying “an important update is required” or something like that and i’ll go to update the app but it’s already updated! and i’ll log back into the app and get kicked off again with the same message.....
. it's ok when it works, but it takes forever to do anything. it's extremely slow. now it's stuck so it crashes everytime i log in so it can't be used at all. edit: reinstalling the app seems to fix the crash bug.
. this app is rubbish. it doesn't do the single thing you'd think was necessary using phone camera to take photo of receipt to attach to transaction.
loving it. since the most recent update, i am loving this app!
bugs. there are alot of bugs in the app. i am about to go back to square. the app keep giving alot of errors.
powerful bookkeeping in your hand.. fantastic program to track costs, expenses, create invoices and it's all done to generally accepted accounting principles.
. this app is awesome and helps to organize your life and your business habits
sales tax. cannot use the app on my phone because it does not calculate sales tax correctly. spoke with customer service. they know the issue and do not seem to think it’s important to fix it. makes the app almost useless to me
organized. been in business for 20 years and been using this app for a year. love it. still lots beyond my abilities and i wish there was a little more help in the app for the accounting inept like me but i just bring the app to my accountant and they can pull all the data needed. recommend it. see sales, cost, accounts receivable at any given moment.
android user. would give it 5 stars if product button was available as it is on apple. great app, easy to use.
unusable on ipad pro. was intending to transfer all of my business computing over to my more than capable ipad pro. intuit seems to have other ideas. unable to run my business with the quickbooks software with the app or through the browser. a very unsatisfactory situation having my computing need dictated by intuit. will change software as soon as practical.
useful app. adds a lot of useful abilities to your mobile device. i'm not a heavy user of it, but i have not had issues with it for months using the basic features.
no support for timesheets. also no custom reports
love quickbooks app!!!. great app. allows me to conduct business while on the road when computer access it not possible.
quickbooks online + app. quickbooks online is making my business accounts so easy. the bank connections feature allows you to sync online accounts straight into your account records. when new transactions are available, you can view and add them straight into your accounts, made easier by quicbooks match feature that marks transactions with previous similar transactions. support during setup period has been excellent which has made switching from another online accounting software quite an easy process. very impressive so far.
best app i've used!. i started my small business with quickbooks and i was able todo everything in one application! from sale receipts, expenses, lodging gst and more. i would highly recommend quickbooks to all business owners
. after new update app stuck on dashboard. unable to perform work on app. please fix this issue
. i thought it was bad three years ago! its much worse now. not user friendly and still doesnt support my form of business. all they really do with this app is track your bank account and catigorise things. you can only catigorise as an expense or income. its the new year and new month and its counting transaction from jan 2019 as transactions from december 2018. i need help. any recomendations on business softwesr that also has tax softwear?
. reasonable app, i don't ask much of it to be honest but being able to invoice onsite is nice. the feature for photographing receipts is pointless as you still have to enter all of the information anyhow, and it would be nice to be able to send a customer a statement from the app while i'm stood in front of them. i don't use the receive online payment option so i can't comment.
appliance men. great app.. 💯. all you need to run your small business on the go ... team it up with square for the ultimate in portability team both up with an ipad and you have excellence
. it's great handy thing. i like it very much because now i can produce invoices when ever i want.
great!. this app for quick books is fantastic! works just as it's supposed to! thanks!
great app. very good photo function. so, no need to save receipt.
the best app ever. now we can run our business with this app.very convenient and easy to use.
. takes hours for a verification email with pin to get sent. i can't wait that long before i can access my accounting!
please support khmer keyboard. please support khmer keyboard
adding pdf. can not add pdf attachments. to my invoices. app is crashing. please fix this.
. ok that yiu charge a monthly fee but not ok to charge more than $2 for every payment deposit. will not be using this app for payment anymore. ridiculous!
. excellat ap this app is great. keeps me informed even when i am out in the field. i love it.
. good app need less pricing for subscription
nothing but disappointment. car tracking constantly shows that there is uncategorised trips when it is up to date. software won’t integrate with desktop version. 3 days before end of financial year quickbooks stops bank account updating inputs. then quickbooks support solution causes double entries. two week later accounts won’t update anymore again.
. great app. would like to see a banking tab like online.
handy phone app. the iphone app has come in very handy for creating quick estimates on the road or adjusting existing quotes in the go
the application for the tablet. the application for my ipad tablet does not let me see checks i have written that have not cleared. (it does show my account balance) i like the online version but i for the life of me don’t know why the internet based application does not work on my ipad plus and their application for ipads is simply said  horrible.
. switch to xero even though its more expensive. better off wasting money on a useless app. cant even save a transaction. lousy support and engineering team to not resolve such a essential feauture after 1 month. subscribe at your own risk.
many bugs. need to fix bugs that cause the app to not follow the regular online access. employees can see things they shouldn't (like business income) and are unable to do things they should like entering customer info and invoices.
. easy and quick to use for estimates, invoices , receipts and keep track of expenses and income
great app for qb online. when i need an invoice sent out and i'm away from my pc, qb solved the inconvenience with this app. one thing i can't find is how to change the figure slide login.
. app is great, i use it all the time.
. im not a big on technology but i love this app.
love but.... great! except would love to be able to make a deposit with the app
. very efficient and in depth of a record of labor expenses and profit
new update keeps crashing. well ever hour or two it crashes while i am in the middle of looking things up or when i am making an estimate for a customer. and this is with the pastiest update. oh and it keeps telling me there is a new update, but i already have it. fix it, my renewal is coming up and you aren’t the only game in town
last version have a lot of issues. since i got the last update, the app crashes a lot and its very slow!!
no customer service. i like the application and the features which can be improved of course, but i can't give them more then two star. is more than one week and no technical support. i can't buy this application without support.
wow.... what an amazing product now all we need is timing inside the app for us people who bill by the hour or half.
. great way to keep track of my invoices for my company
needs features. app seems to get bug fixes but vary rarely does it get new features. as a mobile professional i would like to have the same features in the app as on the computer. currently investigating other more powerful mobile options vs quick books update: can't even enter expenses with the app only a pc! in the usa they can enter expenses with the app.... wish i could deduct an extra star just for that.
quick books. great app
amazing. i haven't seen smart accounting software like this 👍🏼
. trying to uodate this app. it wont update and i can not sign in. please help love using it
fonts too big and can’t be read anymore. since the latest update, fonts are too large and you can’t read the amounts of your invoices anymore. sent them many screenshot examples, still can’t use the app anymore. also, sometimes you can’t even “accept” an invoice on the app as well. useless for me to use now. what a shame, because i used it daily. iphone 11 pro with latest ios v13.2.2
app not working on my phone. app is currently not even loading before it crashes. nextbit robin on marshmallow 6.0.1. sent error report weeks ago and nothing yet...
. this app is now horrible, it was great up until latest update and now i am unable to run my business using this app. very frustrating when an app takes steps backwards please help????
just ok. your misleading us when you say i can run my entire business from my phone. try opening an invoice with an employees time added. i also cannot enter time.
fantastic software !. currently in a middle of a building site, sending clients invoice & estimates. now my time is my own this evening ! couldn’t do with out it .
. very user friendly
needs a delete feature.. so i downloaded this for my business and decided to do a sample invoice and payment to and from myself. however i cannot delete this. i tested to make sure i could use this effectively before switching to it. without the delete invoice or payment option i am out of luck.
sweet baby jesus this is exactly what i need. it has never been so easy to stay so financially organized. as someone who os chronically disorganized this app is a blessing. definitely worth the price when you need to record your expenses and write receipts, invoices and all sorts of other business related things to be professional.
. still learning the ins and outs of the app, but so far i love
top notch program. i use it everyday for business! easy to use and cut my estimating time in half. i can even send estimates from the program. definitely worth the money.
app keeps crashing. keeps saying the session is over when i sign in and logs me out
. easy to use and make life way easier to keep track of inventory and sales.
new update changed invoices. the app shuts down every time i get a signature!!
très bon logiciel de gestion. très impressionnant, facile d'utilisation.
customer service and functions. you can be completely locked out upon renewal of your subscription. it has locked me out of entering for the last six days. tech support has been pretty useless at fixing it. with all the other flaws the online program has, avoid with every thing you have. you get no back up, high incompatibility, and many accountants hate it. your emailed invoice has a habit of hitting the spam bin,it isn't even compatible with other intuit products. avoid avoid avoid
garbage. this app is junk!! support for this app is useless looks like i will be going back to freshbooks, it may not be a accounting solution but at least it works and i can import my info without manually entering. my business doesn't have time for me to spend hours with support when i need to be taking care of my customers ms support
. great app.
. vg and lot much improved with very good customer care support. thankx.
wonderful app.. wonderful app. makes my life so much easier. wish i would have signed up with qbo earlier.
app crashes. this app crashes or cannot save my data on every entry i make. horrible app!!
office portability. i can post info on the fly, keeping my books up to date, even up to the minute. my clients can get estimates instantly when asking for them. my bookkeeper can see what's going on with me right now.
. great accounting capabilities for small and medium enterprises, compatible across all my devices. taxation is resolved quickly, no stress and most definitely no complains
fantastic software !. this has made my life a whole lot easier. invoice and estimates on the go. i really feel in control of my accounts.
great invoicing app. works great for invoicing needs.
. excellent and simple to use
. still learning the ins and outs of the app, but so far i love
best bookkeeping app. it has everything you need to make your small business life easy & hassle free!
please: give us delayed charge already!. a new update, and still no delayed charge feature. how many times do we have to ask? for the love of gawd, why can i not add a delayed charge on the mobile app?????? this is something you actually want to do when you're at a client, not get them to sign for an invoice every time you visit them during the month.
pool guy. quickbooks forced me to update from our quickbooks mobile windows invoicing system to quickbooks mobile with only five days notice. this was very poorly planned by quickbooks and put us in a bind. however the new quickbooks mobile online system is truly fantastic and offers many more powerful features and ease of accessibility. recommendation: this app needs the ability to create a monthly statement that i can email from my phone to my customers. currently i can only do this from a laptop.
. bank feeds never update. been telling me to check back in a couple of hours for 3 days. resync doesn't work. completely useless without updated banking information. uninstalling and never returning. stick to the web browser bc this app is a waste of my time and space!
. fácil de usar, excelente para los que los que trabajamos por fuera
great tool for those on the go!. while there is a lot of functionality missing that would make this app even more convenient, what it does offer is a tremendous help while on the go. from creating invoices to recording expenses to seeing your p&l and balance sheet, this app is a great tool and extremely easy to use!
poor software and worse support. software has limited features and the support agent gave me 3 different answers to 1 question. what hope does anyone else have with support like that. avoid this product
newest update issue. hi, i love this app and it normally works great. when i updated my ipad, i can no longer take payments because of a weird glitch that keeps the total amount $0 even if the item is $25. i emailed with screenshots. giving you a heads up to look for that. at the moment, i can’t process any payments. it’s frustrating! thank you.
mr. doesn't work on ipad pro or iphone. it says my subscription has expired. i have had it for several years and it still works on macbook but on ios it thinks i am on a free trial until 13th april but still locks me out saying i need to update my subscription. it is useless to me if it won,t work on ipad because i photograph all my receipts into the app. will cancel subscription if it doesn't work soon.
love the app!. absolutely love this app. i can do everything on my phone on the go and hardly ever need to pull up qb on my computer. beautiful lay out, intuitive design and easy to use.... i'd rate it an a+ 👍
. this app has helped its tracked and it's made things with my accounts look like i know what i'm doing
glitchy software loses emails really crappy support. issues remain for years intuit does not fix. loses emails all the time invoices say sent when they are not.
. great app, very useful
. works great for my small constructionconsulting business. great for invoicing and sending estimates.
"rarely works. the quickbooks app worked great for awhile. now with the last update, nothing refreshes. i'm always receiving messages that it can't ""update at this time. try again later."" very disappointing"
sweetness!. clearly...they have small, growing businesses in mind. this app has really brought our company to the next level. we love it!
. if you have your own business you need this app!
. qb online is a great app needs to be able to accept cc though.
no multi currency = useless. i enabled multicurrency on my quickbooks account, which you can not revert once applied. and now i find that when i log into the app, it won’t show transactions or customers that use anything other than my base currency. useless. utterly useless.
good for small business. i have a hvac & plumbing company and this helps keep everything in order. just wish there was a way to offer options on the estimates to my customers so they could pick which things they want to have done.
. great app and also great customer service they answer my questions very fast.
overly complicated for sole prop. this app is useless for simple small business money in money out, it shouldn’t be this hard and definitely not worth the fight
. sucks. terrible app
consider other programs.... purchased quickbooks for the fact it is easy to photograph receipts and upload, which worked for about 2 weeks and now always comes up with a error.... tried reinstalling etc, still doesn’t work. useless.
missing functionality. reliable app but authentication is too slow. also some features aren't available. i sometimes just use the web app through the browser to access those features.
new receipt feature not properly tested!. this new receipt photo feature is terrible. it captures about half the receipt every time! fix it, and test your changes before releasing them. a massive step back.
excellent interface and convenient app. this app is a life saver and helps me run my small business affairs smoothly. i can submit my invoices and estimates on the go with ease. definitely a must app to have.
simply superb!. quick books app really took my accounting overview in a single glance. thanks qb team for amazing ui
subscription bug driving me crazy!. for the last few weeks the quickbooks app has been unusable! it alerts me that my subscription has expired and will lock me out of any activities. i have been on the phone with tech support, my subscription is up to date, it gets fixed for a day and then the problem re emerges the next day. this is an excellent app when this problem does not exist. i use a fully updated ipad pro. please fix this bug!
. i am really happy by the way it helps me keep track of my expenses and consumption taxes. one thing i would like to see on the mobile app is being able to view your taxes, same as you can on the desktop version.
best app for accounting. i used another app before but quickly switched to quickbooks. it is by far the best out there in the market in terms of features and ease of use. i am not an accounting expert but now i can quickly generate my financial statements and get funded. thanks a lot!
touch id rules. much easier to login now.
entering bills?????. why have intuit decided not to support bill entering on this app?!? it great i can import my paper receipts using the camera, but whats the point if i can't enter as a bill only an expense?!?
victorowner. easy and convenient. best investment i’ve made for my business.
it's only a trial. this looks brilliant until you've set up the account only to find out that it's a 30 trial. by that time they've got your email. well done them. clever!! immediately deleted
. have had an issue with sending invoices through my app for the last 3 days. even after several calls and emails no one can tell me when this will be rectified. poor support and unorganized for such a large company.
create a project under a customer for ios. this needs to be added asap. we are a mobile company and would very much utilize creating a project on the go in ios. both for ipad and iphone. thanks.
great program. i like it's ease of and accessibility from anywhere. i haven't had any issues.
useless!. can't edit products without losing the changes. can't edit purchases. overall, still very buggy and slow. had to buy a windows 10 tablet to get it to work. mobile apps for ios and android sucks big time!
useless app for working in qbo. only found 2 reports available through the app. can’t “drill” into figures on the 2 reports provided. cannot access expenses on coa can’t really get any work done.
. great for small business. easy to learn.
not working!!!!!. i've had this program for a year and it's not working today!!! i can't accept edit or accept credit card payments.... argh!!
. invoices can't add cost except discounts to my invoices using my s4 phone.
this might be 5 stars. the only thing... only thing!!! using square through the app .. or somehow sync invoices so they reflect in qb. if there is a way to do that then this is 5 stars!!
. great app. life gets easier.
works good. easy to use.. it's really easy to file expenses with this. that's all i really need a mobile accounting app for.
. useless app. waste of money. lousy support. subscribe at your own risk. i am cancelling mine
stuck in data download. can't open app on ipad or iphone. stuck in a data download loop. support says there are no known issues, what a joke.
sorely disappointed. intuit made good products maybe even great products at one time. now their cloud offerings a just released with out any concern for features and bugs. disappointed. somebody has gotten to big to care about their customers.
. really helps me track my buisness expenses
"it doesn't synchronize. the app is totally unusable. it doesn't synchronize customers and supplier and the transaction with those missing from the list result as incomplete. tried also to dis install and reinstall: same story. on top of this it must also said that the assistance is unresponsive, many days and repeated enquiries to finally get emails full of irritating smileys and useless answers like ""we are constantly improving the apps to serve our mobile customers""."
fantastic for on the go.. customers pay me and i put it right in the app. no waiting until i get home to forget. love this app.
. easy to use with a clear overview of your business expenses
. quickbooks is simple to use and makes the book work easy for myself as a small business.
the app needs work. the web based service is great, but the app needs work. the tool i need (journal entries) are not available through this app, so it's not very useful.
easy. i'm now able to send bids to potential clients easily.
great support. we use the app almost exclusively to keep our business mobile. recently had an issue and contacted customer chat to get it resolved. they had me screen record it happening and said they would push to engineering for fix. honestly didn’t expect anything fast but they fixed the issue and included it in the new patch. it’s been about a week or less so a big thank you the support teams for getting it fixed and getting us back to normal.
. i love this app
. realmente útil y fácil de usar, después del periodo de prueba no me peso pagar su precio.
. great app for running my business
great app. i'm a technology consultant and really appreciate the flexibility this app affords for invoicing clients and getting paid on the spot.
". i like it better then sage. seems easy enough for what i am looking for. yes it is ""online"" so you need internet connection but it makes for seemless connection between phone and computer. had a few questions and support was great and got back to me same day both times."
. best app for accounting purpose
time saver, makes everything simple. thus app saves time and allows for doing simple tasks on the go making my church more accurate and efficient
doesn't work. omg i'm so frustrated with this app...now it doesn't work at all on my note 5 i've report the error so many times and no reply
. this software is superb for business owners but need some customization in product and services option they should provide stock quantities in app and also purchase invoice with itemised discounts option should provided in app
crashes, isn't sign in. stock nexus 5x. app won't sign in, hangs, now crashes every time.
. quickbooks is great. i've been using it for a few years. customers can pay directly through their email and it makes keeping track of sales and expenses very easy.
wonderful app.. wonderful app. makes my life so much easier. wish i would have signed up with qbo earlier.
dig it!. i mainly use the app for looking at financials, but the invoicing, reporting, and such is great too.
wish i could charge cards on file. love the app, just wish i could input new customer's card information and charge the existing customer's cards on file when accepting payments so i could do my accounting from anywhere.
. awesome app.
love it!. great mobile online app tool that syncs with your online quickbooks on both mac and pcs.
. good app for a start up business and it will grow with your business.
. it's a great app
. we use this to track our business expenses and are so pleased with the functionality of it! it just gets better with each update.
. instructions to cancel do not allow me to cancel my subscription.
crashes with galaxy s7 edge android 6.0.1. i have a new samsung galaxy s7 edge running android 6.0.1. every time i try to log into the app it crashes when signing in and offers to send a report. but the send crash report button results in blue screen. have to force close. very frustrated as i am used to using the app constantly. update: customer support was able to assist with the issue once i emailed them.
intuitive. qb does a great job with the app. easy to understand if you use qb online.
. great app
. je n'arrive pas à le télécharger!! fini jamais ...... :(
. so easy to use and navigate
useless. i am an avid qbo for ie customer for many years, but this ipad app is useless. can't do anything with it, and can not see banking info, the most important thing in accounting! if you want to view customervendor names that can be done, but you can't work in this app. view only.
very nice app. easy to use makes life lot easier and saves time
excellent and easy to use. fantastic app would recommend it to anyone that asks
19.11.2 awful update. first thing i noticed was there is no search bar for customers, so i have to scroll through thousands of customers to find the one i’m looking for. secondly, i had hoped that we’d be able to view estimates and invoices in landscape mode to see them better, nope. then, when i tried to navigate back to the main customer list, there’s no back button! this version was nowhere near ready to be released.
great app. i run a it buisness. have loved using this app. i love being able to do invoices while i'm away from my computer.
life saver!. i absolutely love this app. when i first started out and i didn't have that many funds in the bank, this was one expense i didn't even have to overthink. after using quickbooks online app for only a week i knew i could never go back to organizing my finances on my own. i use it every single day!
. if you have to write off expenses for your business like meals, travel ect.....get this app now!!!! very simple and user friendly.
a couple requests. could you make the search able to search by words in the invoice. i do automotive repair. like if i typed in starter it would show all invoices with that in it
eli's green cleaning. great app extremely convenient for everything that i need to do for my business
when i am done, i am done!. as a contractor i love to do my estimates one time, hit convert to invoice one time, hit receive payment one time and i am done with my paperwork and money is heading my way before i leave the job site. when i get home i can just spend time with the family rather than swim through paperwork. great service!
ios 13 crashing. app crashing after password screen , ios 13 is not compatible with this app at present , considering the amount my company pays for quickbooks i’m disappointed to say the least .
great. helps me track all of my business needs from estimates and invoicing to financing. great app!
worse than useless. i downloaded this app as use quickbooks daily, the pc software is great! the apple app is such a waste of time, i can’t access any reports and the info it does show me is a waste of my time just a load of numbers that don’t mean anything. no thought has gone into this app i suspect it’s just a tick box exercise creating an app...
not pleased. for one i still can't redownload the app after i accidentally deleted it. it's been months. i hit the cloud button and it does nothing. i also put an estimate in and the phone didn't save it. when i checked desktop it was saved 6x because i kept trying to do it on the phone. the app has many glitches but it is helpful when i'm not by a computer but u cannot rely solely on the app.
. great app gets the job done on the go tied it and liked it!
. the desktop app is great, the mobile android one is bad, it freezes all thr time, crashes, doesn't work.
. really, no way to tell a bank account to go get updates? i wasted my time downloading and using this app.
not so great. appears so different on mobile then desktop. allot of functions not available in the app. can’t really use it on the go. for example cannot fill the site details on app as it dose not appear.
. this app is missing some very important things like deposits and time entry.
. amazing app
love this app. helps a lot with my work
. awesome... works across all of my devices so i can invoice, receive payment and create customers wherever i am. i can even check to see who has and hasn't paid me and send a reminder email to them if needs be, all from my phone, tablet or laptop... should have used this ages ago instead of previous well known others.
great layout!. i find quickbooks online easy to navigate. the menus are logical and easy to use even before you learn the app. i'm glad i made the change to qbo!
appreciated. great app, looking forward for same features as of website!
update breaks layout in iphone xr. latest update breaks the invoices page layout. long client names force the amount column into a single space column. now the amounts show like this. $1 2 3 4 instead if this $1234
great for invoices. i use it mainly for invoicing.
. make sure you know what services they provide, as customer support likely knows less than you do.
. great app!!
. app isn't working. i keep getting an error message while it's loading.
. very good and intuitive, i had trouble recording all my sales, but it's super practical with the app
crashing and signing out. hi there this app continuously crashes saying it needs crucial updates. there are no updates and continues to do the same over and over again. i cannot use it at all now. help.
. no option to import sales and purchase. even a free software in india provides this feature. need to install a third party software for that and is very confusing. purchased the service but not now i will not use this.
review. love quick books but feel very much alone when it comes to new stuff or thinks i need help with it would seem to me that qb think that everyone as the same knowledge level as they do and a diary like the original one with barclays bank would be very useful
couldn’t be worse. worst customer service out there. pulled money out of my account when they made a mistake.
efficient. this app makes my life easier. has all the features i need to keep my business running smoothly.
crash, crash, crash. this app will crash and after every single thing you!
crashes on open. useful app until this update. it crashes on open, both on ipad and iphone. cannot do business this way...
newest update ruins app. after updating my app touch id no longer works and i can't receive payments and clear invoices anymore also it makes me sign in every time i open the app , before this update the app worked perfect and deserved a 5 star rating , you have ruined it and made it unusable , you need to fix this.
quick books app. absolutely love this app, its works fabulously well on my iphone, and i can process things quickly and easily without having the panic of having to beside the computer 247. great
love it. very useful
error!. when i login with credentials it says connecting and finally shows me error
. it's a great app for any business. easy to use and your data could be accessed any where you are.
not good for my use. i would like to have a setting to hide all account information so i can have employees out with ipads giving estimates or quotes. this is for personal business. good for that but forget trying to take pictures of receipts to write expenses.. takes longer than scanning them on my pc
. good app
app login. i can not login to app using my online login details. have reset again and again and nothing works. very frustrating
simple but robust.. with a great user interface connecting with the larger data and programme, i’m impressed by the elegant and obviously intentional design. when i look at my phone, i’m looking at exactly the kind of information that i would need on the go. very good design work by these guys.
. not the smoothest running game app
. great app for accounting
. it stop tracking my miles 3 days ago and now it's useless to me. don't waste your money.
. nice app...very usefully
no option to add revenue into qb. there is not option, i have found, to integrate revenueincome related transactions into quickbooks. topnotch when it comes to documenting expenditures, but lacking when it comes to revenueincome
. love it. customer service is fabulous. it just keeps improving!
. this app lags like crazy. i have a note 8 so it's not the phone. why have an app if the performance is poor?
. its very good program keeping my books in order, reminding of unpaid invoices connects to external management software, great stuff
. fantastic app for keeping my expenses up to date on the go and much more!
crashes. downloaded this onto my ipad. as soon as i open it up it instantly crashes.
". what app is it .. ""unable to sign up"" over and over again,"
meh, no project profitability reports in the app. as a construction business all our accounting revolves around p&l reports per project. the onlinedesktop app gives us the project report but the app does not, which makes the app pretty much useless. our best solution is to login to our qbo account through safari on the phone to see the real time project profitability, shouldn’t the app do that?
aplicación útil y práctica. el uso de la aplicación es fácil e intuitivo y permite controlar casi todas las funciones de la versión web. en mi opinión lo único que falta es la capacidad de hacer tareas offline. esto sería de gran ayuda para avanzar el trabajo cuando estás sin conexión (en un avión por ejemplo) y también es importante que se amplíe la posibilidad de conectar con más bancos, el mío no está disponible ahora y eso es una carga de trabajo extra. enhorabuena
. there was supposed to be a 30day free trial and they charged me anyway this app is not recommended.
occasional early glitches with mobile overall v good. i use the mobile version and it's access to my phone contacts makes it really good. there have been a few minor glitches with support but this is getting better and better  so apart from the few minor glitches early on then it would be getting 5⭐️
keep crush !. my iphone version is ios11.2.1. i can’t open this app. keep crushing. please fix asap.
johannes. owner very good accounting program my accounted dose not care for it online but owell i like it
. excellent app.
great app. this app makes keeping up with everything so simple!
love it. i love the quickbooks program because all of my employees can log into the program from different locations at the same time.
professional and practical. love this app! makes my business paperwork so much easier!
. this app doesn't work! such a disappointment to say the least! i'll edit my review once the app is available for use! still not working! uninstalling for now! i hope that you fix it!
keeps crashing. i am trying to use this app on my s7 on sprint. everytime i log in it crashes and ask to send crash report. ive installed it a few times now. please fix bug.
pretty basic and useless. can't do a lot of things. it's very very basic , pretty much a basic overview of your account. you can’t do anything even as detailed as seeing the transactions in a pl report. it’s only broad overview stuff and entering new transactions. can’t even switch cash vs accrual. severely limited and cannot work in a pinch when you can’t use an actual computer.
. this app takes forever to do anything. it literally takes a minute just to open after i tap the app icon. completely useless. information is not reflected correctly during use. just use a web browser instead.
. excellent for a busy contactor. easy to send quotes and invoices to clients.
i rely on online sync with my external banks. i'm disappointed the subscription i pay for is not mobile. i imagine it would take a lot of programming to include sync on mobile tablets but if it's already hosted on the server, why no access? i'm not a architect but i imagine outsourcing the sync hardware off the tablet you could get your current transactions on mobile . maybe i'm crazy
request. how can i easily find the last price charged to the customer on a specific item?
jireh landscaping. great!! great program and app!!
changed my business. this app has worked wonderfully. it fills the role of a second employee. accounting has never been so easy for both myself and for my clients to complete their bill.
makes it easy. i love the easy to use format and more professional looking invoices and estimates. and the format saves me a lot of time filling out forms. before i was hand writing the estimate, scanning and then emailing from my computer at home. qb does all that from my phone. it works very well for my small business.
. very useful.
. i can no longer create or see invoices. my home page is literally blank except for the header and the home menu buttons on the bottom.
i like it. does everything i need mobile. clients, invoices and information...all that i need on the go.
qb app. not useful as it could be as you can't enter a bill! not being able to enter a bill makes it useless to work from an ipad or tablet device.
doesn't work. every time (every single time) i try to use the app (on my galaxy s7), it throws an error. it has never worked one time. i login and it throws an error.
no more receipts in my pocket. shoot the receipt and record the transaction, now even more quickly with touchid
this app is useless on android.. i can not believe that this app is this bad. i can only see customers invoices that i have been to in last 2 months. i use to be able to see 10 years worth of invoices. please fix asap. unless you can carry a laptop at all times which is not practical this again is useless.
no es para argentina. bien pero no pude incluir los bancos
. dreadful experience so far. bought qb 16th dec 2019 and cant get a call back from an english speaker to help me with set up despite multiple attempts! why is sales uk based but support isnt? this is 2nd review  1st disappeared!!! so disappointed and very desperate to get started. i can login to qb online but says im in usa not uk please tell me who to email in response qb
. it does everything i need it to, customer service is really helpful when you're learning how to use it, and the convenience of accessing your books anywhere anytime is exactly what a busy person needs.
crashes. upgraded to ios 10, now app will no open.
. great app and very simple to use.
good app. very useful
invoicing. i'm sending invoices easily!
works great!. for an app this is very powerful and lets you know the basics on the run.
really good !. used a different invoicing program for years but would not sync with quickbooks. so i went over to the best and figuring it out. quickbooks online has made it easy to work through. good job developers !!
. this app no longer works. i cannot make invoices, sales receipts, etc. i called quickbooks and they said there is nothing they could do. i have a mobile business and relied on this app, now it's useless.
great app. good for a non accounting person like me. i can keep track and give it all to my accountant and it gets done. i love that i can send invoices from my ipad and enter info etc. two thumbs up!
. trial no thanks $12.99 per month, no thanks one time will be ok but not monthly
since last update app is glitchy. usually this app works great but since last update it has a couple glaring glitches that make it less then desirable to use.
. lacking abundantly completely unprofessional, there's about 5 options, you can't even put together an invoice that you could realistically give to a customer. i'm very very disappointed.
. this is a pretty amazing service, and i highly recommend. the only complaint i have is that the setup of products doesn't make a lot of sense to me, by way of required categories that i don't quite have nailed down, but honestly that seems more like user error. love it, haven't looked back since.
mr. o'neal. great program.
bid sheetcost. it would be awesome if the was a template for a bid and not just an estimate. also, qbo is too expensive.
experience getting worse. entering transaction requires way too many taps. it isn’t location aware to suggest transactions you just always search. recent updates have some bug that makes the app download the data file with almost every login and login often you must. usually twice a week it loses my password. i have enjoyed quickbooks online but this app experience may have me evaluating competitors in december.
. slow customer service meant i was unable to upgrade from qbse to quickbooks online. tried clear books instead, app is not great but otherwise they are a vast improvement, particularly the bank sync which is so much more reliable. i get the feeling qb have grown too quickly and do not have the infrastructure to support their customers.
tops. i've never used any accounting software or accounting apps in my life & can honestly say this is the best! if you type 55378008 into any xl column & turn your laptop upside down it spells..boobless! 😄
. very useful
fonts too big and can’t be read anymore. since the latest update, fonts are too large and you can’t read the amounts of your invoices anymore. sent them many screenshot examples, still can’t use the app anymore. also, sometimes you can’t even “accept” an invoice on the app as well. useless for me to use now. what a shame, because i used it daily. iphone 11 pro with latest ios v13.2.2
offline mode. i wish i could enter transactions without an internet connection. then they would synch after the device reconnects.
not easy to use. simple tasks like entering a transaction are complex. app and online qb have a slow response when tapping things. just overall frustrating trying to switch from desktop qb to the app and online qb.
very handy. excellent app love it save me hours in office
crashes no bill of lading. missing two things, send invoices by text message and create bill of lading
very good mobile app. i use this on my computer and when i noticed that there was an app for android, i immediately installed it on my tablet and phone. a must have if you have a mobile business or have to give invoices on the go.
great app!. very useful and convenient app.
. i use qb app every day. very user freindly
. can do a lot quickly. like most apps doesn't allow you to do everything you can do on full site. great for adding invoices on the go.
. excellent app. crazy versatile. love that they supply a basic reader free of charge. lots of ways to accept payment. input expenses so you can write them off for taxes. nice. stoked to use it.
app is glitching. ever since the new update to the quickbooks mobile app, it has been glitching every time i try to open the app. every time i click the app it closes by itself. it's frustrating whenever i have to log anything in the app. i have to constantly delete the app and reinstall it for it to work properly again.
. changed my work style this app changed my work style. now i can handle my accounts from any where in world. love this
. can't even get started. created an account and tells me i have 30 days but then tells me i have no subscription whenever i attempted to log in.
no longer works on ipad. this app is no longer functioning as of the most recent update. it used to work on the ipad. the camera feature is difficult to use when trying to take a picture of receipt. it doesn't allow me to record payments any longer. please fix.
excellent on the go apps  for small business. easy to navigate .
crashing all the time. i know it's version 1.0, but still. it's crashing left, right and center all the time. you may want to wait 68 months before this app is stable.
. dissatisfied. was able to get on to thw app because it kept saying there was an error. i was to finish the processes of registering online but just want to try out beforw purchasing it. it would allow me too. uninstall.....
. keeping update and on track
. needs lots of work yet. it's not fullfunction, and lists with subelements are totally useless. now that qboe is more tabletready, skip this app and go straight to qboe.intuit.com with your favorite browser.
. great app
loved it.... very useful app... i can use it in any platform. that is the the best thing. loved a lot !!!!!
beware of this service. i was told today by their rep that they are a very small business and they are not prepared to handle medium to large business’ transactions. after we have made the switch and spent so much time converting everything over and using their service we were told that they only want to handle a small portion of transactions. ugh.
garbage. quick books won’t upload garbage use and other accounting software.
excellent for the it service provider. as an it service provider, this app allows me to log my hours and mileage in the field. i can even email customer invoices immediately after services are performed. this is, of course, paired with quickbooks online plus, which allows you to log hours per customer. highly recommended!!
disappointing. this is a very unstable product with an unreliable app server. if my accountant didn't require it, i would not use it!
useless!. can't edit products without losing the changes. can't edit purchases. overall, still very buggy and slow. had to buy a windows 10 tablet to get it to work. mobile apps for ios and android sucks big time!
happy and safe. at last. an easy to use app that work well for fast quoting and invoicing while on the go. my b2b clients are very impressed on how fast my quotesinvoices come in. it's a great selling point to my business.
. one of the best accounting app anyone can think of
still needs work. one thing needed i’d making it easier to change customers info when doing a new invoice for a previous customer but at a new address. i have many customers that own many places and i need to be able to put the address in for each place where the work is done with that same customer and the app doesn’t allow this to happen.
. makes life much easier.
app isn’t working after updating to ios 13.. app isn’t working after updating to ios 13.
quickbook online plus. it's alright. i hope u can work on the invoice template options to add: * individual discount% column for each input * additional description column * additional customized invoice number top rhs * ability to change currency on the invoice itself * add exchange rate manually
. a great program for anyone with their own business. its a small price to pay to be able to stay organized and keep your business on track. rated 4 stars because their is still a couple of stiff areas that need improvement but could be that i dont completely understand the program in those areas.
admin on the go. i have been enjoying this app, much better than the old quickbooks desktop version or reckon hosted. good to see a company with the market share still focused on improving things. wish it had been available in new zealand sooner.
nice having qb in your pocket. easy to operate in the field and keep the paper work down at night. hopefully in time more functionality will be added.
ipad trouble. i’ve been using the self employed app for almost two years. i had some issues with crossover between a new mac and my iphone. though a painful process, tech support eventually fixed it. now after downloading the app on ipad, the app won’t work on the ipad. says mobile access isn’t available. well what have i been doing on my phone for two years then?
not pleased. i put the qb online app on my new ipad thinking i wouldn't have to lug my laptop around the country anymore.... it does not have the functionality or settings i need. i cannot input bills from other contractors on the mobile app! they have a loooong way to go... it’s still clunky and like the cd desktop versions severely mentally disabled cousin. lame........
. this app is extremely easy to use and keeps all of my business accounting running smoothly and quickly. i haven't had any problems and neither have any of my customers.
. this app isn't ready for primetime. used to work better. the reconciliation doesn't work if you need to hit the back button on any transaction no matter how many you approve before it. completely frustrating and gets worse with time.
errors. why you never check your app before you launch it online so many errors no touch id when signing no latest activities update receive payment not working and this just 5 min of use
great efficient and cost effective. this app is great and accounting system is too. best value for the money and easy to use.
. very easy to use, takes little effort to keep track of all your sales and spending. i do wish it had a spot to put miles withought buying the mile version though.
useless for sure. qbo is useless. can’t login with google account. forces me to create a newseparate password. can’t really access qbo via a browser on ipad. overall terrible experience. i’m sure it’s equally apple and qbo fault.
. really good for simple operations i only needed the app for a small subset of operations.... that is, quickly open,edit, and send an invoice. i am thankful for that capability. perhaps intuit could stress that the app is not intended to be full blast qbo.
new business.. very user friendly. almost like apple designed it. very unhappy that the email function doesn’t work. many people have complained for over a year and quickbooks still hasn’t offered a fix😠. i have to take a screenshot and copy and paste to my email. not as professional looking, but gets the job done. that one glitch took away two stars because i can’t use my mobile phone to give someone an invoice or estimate.
love this!. they just ended the ability to enter expenses on the road! now it's even better than before. :) the only other feature that would be good would be the ability to enter time on a job or with a client.
. we do all of our estimates and invoices through qb. we love it
. this app is good and easy to use.
poor update. unfortunately this latest update has a bug which believes i am on a free trial which has expired. i can still log in to the system on the internet but the ios versions do not work on ipad or iphone for me now. in addition, an option to receive funds in to another account other than the main current account would be a great feature to implement on ios which is sadly lacking at the moment.
intuit. excelenta si detaliata
most productive app. using this app on my iphone and ipad hs made my life so much easier! i've been able to invoice my customers without having to lug me laptop around. truly an awesome app!
great app for your business. very easy to use. i love the p&l feature and how everything syncs together. really nice app. no complaints
". very disappointed considering i do use the online quickbooks on a daily basis. i installed the app. signed in. then came up with an error message. tried to log in again and it keeps coming up with ""signing in..."" but nothing is happening. 10 minutes later, app uninstalled!!!"
. keeps crashing when entering receipts. it's infuriating. updated review 6 months later still crashes when splitting an expense. tried deleting the cache. it's useless.
fabulous!. i really like using qb, i'm a small business owner and once i got the idea of things i find qb relatively easy to use. when integration starts with square it will be 5 stars for me 😊
worst update yet. just deleted. crashed. didn’t update banking. five star to one in a flash.
ipad trouble. i’ve been using the self employed app for almost two years. i had some issues with crossover between a new mac and my iphone. though a painful process, tech support eventually fixed it. now after downloading the app on ipad, the app won’t work on the ipad. says mobile access isn’t available. well what have i been doing on my phone for two years then?
we are in love with qbo. hated accounting thru qb before but this year's online version plus the android app made us change our mind ... now we absolutely love it and we can't thank the intuit team enough for creating such friendly qb online version for business. much appreciated, lanareale.com
quickbooks online accounting software.. this app is not a doubleentry system accounting app, but rather a singleentry bookkeeping in which you only need to log each transaction of income or expense once, in the way quicken and other check writing software programs work,
mark. great app brilliant for out in the field after initial setup.
. excellent app and it makes computer blues more efficient.
". why can i view expenses but not bills? this should be an essential part of the app, not a ""feature"" that may or may not be added in the future."
epic help. this app is very helpful for me it is very good
convenient.. this app makes book keeping a breeze. billing can be done on the go. i no longer end up behind on my billing do to not being in the office.
what a joke.. if you are moving from qb desktop, think again! there's not even an easy way to just view today's business. no reports in app. useless.
works well but. some features don't integrate with qbo and visa versa. i think this product should be as similar as possible across all available platforms.
after ios 13 update. after updating to ios 13 the app is not opening and i couldn’t use it.... please look into it and give us a solution
basic business. although it does have obvious business needs covered. it doesn't offer the next step in organization. without the ability to create work orders, or track services performed. it remains a minuscule part of my daily business. it really doesn't have anything that separates itself from other simple invoicing programs or applications. it's cloud based convenience remains the reason for my usage.
getting there.... the lack of ability to create bank deposits is vexing. also, would be nice to work with downloaded transactions. works with mint, why not qbo app?
. fast efficient and tech savvy.
almost useless. the app is good for sending invoices only. don't expect to be able to do any other business on the app. the mobile site is about as good as healthcare.gov. you can look at some things but forget everything else. again good for sending invoices only. i expected more from a established company.
. app takes a while to open. tends to freeze once i'm using it. very frustrating
laborious expenses assignments. uploading pictures of billable expenses requires two lengthy entries...first at point of upload info is requested... but for accounting purposes only. second step is required to access list of expenses online and then manually retype all info listed under accounts into item chart...date, item, splits, quantity, rate, amount, check billable and then reenter client to be billed. why this can’t be entered once at point of upload is rediculously annoying. my manual invoicing system took less time than this program takes!
keeps crashing. i am on an iphone 6s and running the most recent ios. every time i try to accept my transactions in my bank account, i get through a few then the app shuts down.
. easy to navigate and perfect for small business owners!
frustrating. it's good to be able to use from iphone etc but i can't get any support or reply for help just doesn't happen seriously thinking of going back to reckon just because of this
. running my online business at ease. quickbooks makes it easy to invoice and they take care of calculating your sales tax to pay your state.
. the app always crashes on me, and now i can't even get it to open.
very satisfied!. been using the mobile app for the past 3 months now, and i can say it does everything i need. very easy to issue invoices, receive the money, match, reconcile the bank. the support people are very helpful and have a lot of patience!
. quickbooks banking is my favorite part of the app, because it's easy you catergorise all your expenses and incomes. the dashboard shows an overview of your financial situation.
app no longer works. everything was good with it for about 6 months now the app no longer allows me to log in saying there has been a security problem. other devices work told by quickbooks support it was being looked into 2 months ago and still nothing. very disappointed that i'm paying for this to not work
love the changes. when i go and look at the transaction using my iphone... i could see the time when the payment was made... i hope it would also show if it's paid in cash, card or check without clicking the invoice...
this makes business owner life that much easier. i love this app, intuit is the best period. i also have mint app but this is easier for me as a business owner as weird as it may sound
excellent tool. the industry benchmark. does exactly what i need  and on the fly too!
very easy to use. the app works flawless. being able to sign in with biometrics, take photo of receipts and capture expenses quickly is one of the many great feature.
. edit from original post... qb quickly resolved the issues and this app is great again!  this used to be a great app, i have used it for 4 years but unfortunately it is no longer working... i can no longer login, i keep getting an error saying it can't sync. i hope this gets fixed soon, i run 90% of my business from my phone and having a working phone app is part of the fee we pay for qb online.
great app. good for a non accounting person like me. i can keep track and give it all to my accountant and it gets done. i love that i can send invoices from my ipad and enter info etc. two thumbs up!
. not a bad app
worst app ever ! not reliable. been using qb for may years, the last few years have been tough for them. we use our mobile app constantly, but it has many issues. it constantly crashes and some day it just won't open. not acceptable. we have taken to customers service many times, but the problems still persist. i get it growing pains right ? is just too much. we are looking for an alternative software like cero. sad but qb get 1 star .
dont waste your time. the support on this app is non existent. signing up is a slow impossible process
. very efficient, very useful
highly recommend. i highly recommend this app. i run my business with quickbooks online and use this app daily. i use it to create estimates and invoices mostly but also look up look up costumers balances and run reports.
. i really like this app just hate just like anything the rate keep going up but ol well i need it!
owner. i have been quite impressed! small owneroperator, able to send invoices, estimates, et al. from my trucklove it!
fees?. i paid over $300 for the qb pc program. i wish they had something basic for free.
love this app!. this has solved my issue of remembering to create invoices after the service. so far i am loving this app :)
great program. it handles almost everything a small business needs. best part is, it's very user friendly.
. i do invoices and print from my recliner. love this app. and sometimes generate estimates minutes after finishing my work before leaving the clients home. very convenient !!
what the crap?. great, now i won't be able to use qb on my iphone. guess i'll have to carry my laptop with me everywhere ughhhhhh. is this because i'm on 32bit iphone 5? i refuse to upgrade, please make it work again!!! 😫🐳
. your mobile app crashed since 2508. unable to launch until today. app is still not working perfectly. unable to edit details especially product and service. keep suggesting to contact support but app complete freeze when i tapped on support.
. if i can navigate this app, anyone can! super easy and really professional. i'm loving it! i love the different reports as well. thank you!
. dreadful experience so far. bought qb 16th dec 2019 and cant get a call back from an english speaker to help me with set up despite multiple attempts! why is sales uk based but support isnt? this is 2nd review  1st disappeared!!! so disappointed and very desperate to get started. i can login to qb online but says im in usa not uk. i have emailed you twice now. still no reply.
. i do not see an option for entering bills from my suppliers. i have to do bill entry from desktop. also how do i issue purchase orders from this app
where's my payroll!. i can wait to do revenue and expense entries until i get back from vacation but i need to be able to pay my employees. useless without it.
awesome app.. make business on the run fast secure and simple. thanks quickbooks
no refund and help support was clueless.. called twice no one could help me and both phone numbers proved useless. billing support was not helpful. could not even locate my ipad online subscription thru itunes. waste of time and money in my experience.
loved the app until banking disappeared. i mainly use my computer to do most of our accounting but loved having the app so i could accept banking transactions during short periods of downtime thereby keeping our bank balance up to date all the time. then today i went to catch up on accepting transactions and banking has totally disappeared from the menu. help! what happened? i deleted and reinstalled the app to no avail.
"missing some elements, overall good. i like this app. great to be able to give client receipt right away. wish we could do deposits and reconciliations and change default ""payment due"" area."
. hi, is there any option for download ar sheet inexcel on mobile app. kindly let us know.
login error. useless if you can't even trust it to login properly.
handy invoicing tool when out and about. i use this app predominantly to invoice as i travel a lot in my job. it has been a bit of a game changer to be able to produce professional invoices on the go. and amazing to keep track of payments.
starting with errors. i am just starting my beekeeping business and trying to track expenses. quick books somehow has me making a $164 sale. i can't erase it because it doesn't exist. would love it but can't reconcile the books if random numbers are calculated out of thin air!
great app. very good have had no issues with it
. easy to create invoices in the field
would like more features. there are some features missing from the mobile version that i prefer  like seeing my bank account register even though i’m connected online; transferring info to turbotax; and automatically crediting extra payments on an account to the next invoice. unfortunately, i cannot transfer to another version except by hand, so i’m staying with this version.
great for invoices on the go. they charge things every so often after you get used to the way it is.
junk update = worthless app. since the latest update, my qb app shows an error saying that my session has expired immediately after i log in. i can't use it at all. pc access is okay.
no access to payroll. the app seems to have a menu for everything except payroll. i find these types of oversights all over quickbooks online glaringly obvious features that are incomprehensibly missing and customer service has no answers. don't waste your time.
it's a good app. very convenient. the mobile app isn't perfect, and as some have pointed out a few features are missing in the mobile app. but qb is convenient. i can take payments, check accounts, and do basic things while i'm out and about. it's good, and quickbooks online support has been great lately.
good. excellent app. some very slight issues with layout and the occasional page that can't be used on ipad. but overall good. would recommend to others
fantastic. fantastic. i'm am obsessed with this app. a must for everyone!
new version problems. ever since the last update, i can no longer categorize and add income and expense from the app. it seems the buttons to “add” do not work.
crashes every time i try to open anything.. i hate this app.
. won't let me unsubscribe to the app so stuck paying a monthly subscription for a service i don't use. there's better completely free apps out there.
good but few bugs. i can see some of the expenses and bills of some suppliers but not all. i would think that if it syncs it should sync for all no?
excellent companion to your quickbooks online subscription.. i rated this app lower than 5 stars when i first reviewed it. purely because it showed my invoices in usd and not gbp. unfortunately there was no way to change it once set. recently i had to completely reset my phone. this gave me the opportunity to install the app fresh. this time it picked up my local currency correctly. so, 5stars from me now.
. quick easy useful
exceptional. this is incredible intuitive software that keeps you completely up to date. it saves hours of time. this is very easy to use. highly recommend for every business owner.
game changer!!!. highly recommend qbo for any business trying to keep up with the cloud. the cloud is the future. for our needs converting to qbo from desktop was the winning choice. qb is constantly improving and it shows. we had a lot of people advising us to dive into the desktop version more but i followed my gut feeling. glad i did. it's my opinion that the desktop will be a dinosaur very soon.
. very good app
great app. i use this everyday and love it. very easy to use.
must have. this app is an all around life saver for the on the go business minded person! freedom to work on the go!! absolutely love it!
. great app
overall ok. if you have an issue good luck getting a hold of customer support. freezes up at least once a week and sometimes i can’t get into my invoices. for what i am paying for i expect more
. software works ok and only ok. however the monthly price seems to have gone up exponentially for no reason over the last 2 years. edit: changed from 3 stars to 1 star thanks to the developer's response.
fantastic!!!. brilliant app. never even noticed the expenses bit so will have to fill this out for the year. absolutely brilliant. first class
. using a samsung note edge: cannot update estimates at all. been using this app for months and it constantly locks up and crashes.
buggy. crashes all the time. always bugging to buy things. bad. uninstalled
track time. so far i’m pretty unhappy with this app because i thought that i could use it to track my time while i was with a client with a timer. i know that i read that somewhere when i was researching this app. that would have been a perfect feature. if this is something that i can actually do and someone can let me know how to do it i will change my rating to 4 or 5 stars.
. makes billing simple on the road
so useful, good updates!.
. zero! the app says it needs to update, then brings me to a screen giving a choice of uninstall or open. if i choose open, i'm back to the need to update. if i uninstall and reinstall, that's just more steps before i'm back to the same useless place. garbage software.
. a joke, support can't resolve any issues
ease of use. being able to utilize the app on mobile has made billing my customers so much easier for my transport company. editing and immediately sending invoices for quick pay is a great option as well. i've been a quickbooks user for 20 years now and will likely not stop anytime soon.
great app. love the details and ability to invoice or add customers on the go!
disappointed. the app on iphone is murch better. this app doesn't enable me to take pictures of recipes. very limited. needs to be more like the iphone app
super app for accounting. super
. the app has never been that useful and honestly i feel like quickbooks is losing my favor. now the app won't change the dates on reports. we live in a day in age when i expect to be able to access information when and where i need it, and if i can't count on something then i need to move to something i can count on.
. great app
. very easy step by step accounting software
. sometimes an app or service gets worse with time. this is one of them. it is stupidly expensive and incredibly unintuitive. please fix the random sign in and sales receipt bug and improve the ui or i will find another product.
. an absolute must for small business.. and seek advice from tech support before assuming. functionality isn't there. ive had no problems... gives me confidence in my books
. quickbooks is rubbish, i have literally wasted days of my life trying to set it up to work efficiently only to hit endless glitches. the last straw was that it lost information vital to my business and therefore money because of lack of clarity on the app. beware 'edit current' actually means actually means change template and loose all previous information. quickbooks don't care about the individual and have not compensated for this.
. love it, very easy to use. excellent customer service
. love this app
bank transactions not loaded. there are several limitations with this app. but my major issue is the inability to load bank transactions. the connected bank account goes sometimes for weeks or months without the transactions transferred to qb. other times they are uploaded every couple of days. there is no option to upload the transactions manually through the app. i called customer service but no one helped. this makes the phone app pretty much useless.
nogo on ipad pro. doesn't look good on ipad pro and doesn't support split screen. need to be able to have qb open on one side and my project system on the other to create invoices.
. app no longer loads. error returned from client
. does what i need but could add a few things i love this app. i use it in my barbershop and i like the fact everything is all there whether it is on my tablet, phone or computer. the only other thing i would like to see incorporated into it is the ability to generate paystubs and do payroll then email to employees. but we can't have everything we want. aside from that, fantastic program. keep up the good work.
. very simple and intuitive to use both i've used the android version and ios
super & excellent apps. very user friendly application . i would recommend this software to other people
. stress free app
impressive for mobile. i posted a bad review because of some bugs. i received an immediate response about upcoming updates and a week later it was fixed. i love that level of support. nice app too.
great app. easy to use app. very user friendly. a must have for small business owner
great product. i love using the cloud version of this software to make my business more streamlined
app is changed for the worse. i am not sure when this happened, but the app is now useless and does not have the functionality it used to have. i now need to do everything on computer. not good.
nice app but i’d like to access the inventory. when you are out and making an invoice it is very important to be able to check the inventory
. my favorite accounting software!
qb app. excellent app is very funcional
. this app is amazing. still trying to figure everything out for my business but i love it. i just wish i could create order forms for my customers
qbo ipad & iphone. i think that intuit is doing an incredible job with this product! the updates have been wonderful for me. it would be 5 stars if i could make bank deposits as well! i've upgraded to 5 stars since i can now do deposits as well. is bank transfer in the future?
latest rev still buggy. when adding a new customer, cannot import contact info besides names. address email and phone numbers not automatically being added while accessing phone contacts. also receiving consistent home error message of being unable to access company info.
. am happy that it allows me to.make estimates from my mobile phone
. great app. obviously nots as many features as browser access but an amazing app nonetheless.
works and convenient. easy way to enter sales and expenses. i've had no problems with this app.
. love the app. in the app we can schedule appointments. we need that feature for online with computer. can't be too hard to do.. thanks.
awesome. one of the best apps i have used for tracking and creating invoices, keeps me on track and easy to use.
. can't even use app from tablet
digital signature. i would like to ask how to get the digital signature on the sale invoice. thanks
crashing. since updating to ios9, quickbooks keeps crashing after the login!!
no american express support. we use american express for expenses and we cannot manage these transactions within the app. not even see them. the app tells me to view quickbooks online in a web browser to manage amex transactions. this makes this app very useless.
needs more... this app needs to have the ability to process statements. then we would not need to use a computer at all. i was expecting to not to need a computer anymore and be completely self sufficient using my ipad or iphone. otherwise it is ok. statements is a huge thing for me.
almost perfect. it would be perfect if there was an overview dashboard that showed outstanding invoices like the online dashboard.
$12.95 a month = free ???. misleading. first month free, then 12.95 a month. my bank is free for these types of services. i'm not happy that i wasted my internet gigabytes on a download that i can't afford. unprofessional. if i could afford i wouldn't pay just because you don't explain that clearly before someone downloads. poor business
can’t create multiple companies. can’t create multiple companies or entities with this program. i would have to pay a subscription fee for each company. if i wanted to track my individual expense, my business expenses, and my llc expenses i would be stuck for $720 a year when the 2013 version on my laptop could create unlimited companies and only cost $300 paid in full.
. denver's is it possible to have a look at the attached file of my resume
update broke. i cannot accept transactions. the only things accessible on the baking screens are back and trash. please fix otherwise it’s useless.
needs time keeping entry. quickbooks really needs to come up with an app to do their time entry for quickbooks online
. as a small business owner it is very easy to balance the books and to get paid within the same app.
. geeat app
very happy with app. the app is very good, and provides a lot of useful information that can be sent anytime, anywhere.
keep logging me out. after the update the application keeps logging me out every single time please fix that, used to do it with the previous update before this last one, you guys fixed it, but with this new update is doing it again
amazing!. only disappointment is the fact i didn't sign up sooner 😝😝😝 well done quickbooks, well done!
. love how easy it is to reconcile and snap pics of receipts!
sucks. half ass 30 day trial. sucks. put ads in the app and make it free. morons
fabulous app. any time, any where, any device. boca bookkeeping and quickbooks online create value. if you need help contact us. bocabookkeeping.com
game changer. changed the way i handle my business transactions. from a simple to complex my invoices and estimates are presentable, traceable and accounted for. my reports help me secure loans in a flash. and my accountant loves me.
best app i've used!. i started my small business with quickbooks and i was able todo everything in one application! from sale receipts, expenses, lodging gst and more. i would highly recommend quickbooks to all business owners
buggy. login with my correct password but it's buggy and won't login. asked me to restart the application many times.
lousy service. spent all morning trying to upload an expense only to be told i had no internet connection. can't it determine i have no server connection? so most of the morning i spent in one que after another and finally hanging up. i must say that the convenience of being mobile outweighed the inconvenience of not having too much versatility, but only if i am able to be mobile. i hate wasting time, and so i want payback.
excellent for small biz and freelancers. as a freelance artist who travels a lot, this app (plus online access) suit all of my accounting needs. easy to follow after you've learned the basics, and love doing my monthly books while on the subway. has clients and books all in one place. helpful to see who owes money and to track income flows across each year. all the reports are fantastic. best accounting software out there, worth the investment imo.
as everyone said wish you a good luck. it looks like this is not my issue, but everyone issue. i'm using it because, i have no other options, but think 1000 times before you put your books inside, i wish if i had this advise before i jumped in. good luck with quickbooks, and your new friends (customer support).
convenient & helpful. as a new business owner and usually overwhelmed with just running the business, the app and website make the financial and tax side of the business easy to stay current and accurate. once i got the initial tax required and payroll payments set up, it's made my life easier.
love it!. quickbooks has changed the way we invoice and track expenses. the ability to provide estimates then convert to invoices is amazing. the mobile app allows me to work on the go.
"bad idea. i downloaded to approve parole only to find i need a second app for that. two out of three ""recognized"" transactions are inaccurate. back to my mac for qb. ugly app guys. sorry..."
. horrible, did not notify of subscription issue. data entered not commited to database. double charged my credit card. terrible customer server (james) experience, nothing resolved
. this is the best and easiest ap to use if your a small business like mine. i can easily create and get paid for invoices on the jobs and not wait till i get to the office. love it!!
excellent app. keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
. zero! the app says it needs to update, then brings me to a screen giving a choice of uninstall or open. if i choose open, i'm back to the need to update. if i uninstall and reinstall, that's just more steps before i'm back to the same useless place. garbage software.
. why does it keep saying that there is technical difficulties in using the app? even before prior update, it had this issue. no issue with the ios app though
not good for my use. i would like to have a setting to hide all account information so i can have employees out with ipads giving estimates or quotes. this is for personal business. good for that but forget trying to take pictures of receipts to write expenses.. takes longer than scanning them on my pc
touchid barely works. this is a slightly less clunky way of entering new invoices, etc than using the quickbooks website on a phone. but the touchid function barely works. at best, once enabled, it remembers the setting for three or four logins, but then asks for the password again. very poor.
. origionally i wanted to use this app for easy application of spreadsheets and invoices, unfortunately when everything wasn't working out for me, i decided to pull the plug and cancel my subscription. unfortunately, it is hard to get a cancellation and stop the reoccurring payments and it has brought me here. i would recommend that you guys make it easier for others to manage your subscription accounts.
great book keeping app. use this app with the online version at home. very happy with it indeed. support could be a little better. but support is adequate. been using it for a couple of years and i'm very pleased.
convenient. moving to quickbooks online plus has been a great move. there was a small learning curve but it is very stable and now we're very happy that we made the change. the best part is using the app on my iphone
. i operate two companies through the app and notice that suppliers and customers from one company end up being listed in the other! i would give more stars, but this is a glaring issue that needs resolving urgently.
crash. your latest update is crashing. it doesn't let me open the app. please fix immediately
. great for you business. i love how i can quickly add an expense by taking a photo of the receipt as well as logging payments on the go. its awesome that you have your data right there at the touch of a button.
check balances. i use desktop version of quick books and love it, but with this app version i just wanted to check the basic ability to check my checking account balance from my register and you can't do that. really intuit it's that the most basic reason of a checking account. please add this and more people will review this app better.
really useful app.. but it would really be so useful if you could print sales receipts directly or even indirectly export as pdf to print on the go via a bluetooth receipt printer.
. much easier than using the mobile site on my phone and very convenient for sending invoices
works amazing! i love being able to attach pictures right to my expenses when i enter them. it is also really nice to be able to enter expenses on the road. it makes bookkeeping a lot easier!
no more ios 8 support. disappointed that app developers are dropping ios8 support. not everyone upgrades the second apple comes out with a new ios
itouch. itouch still doesn't work.
. grat app now with the new version and updates this is the best app for contractors like myself that are always in the field.
. since they changed the app its not working properly nothing appears on the dashboard and can't produce invoices
not what i would have expected!. had the 2010 desk top version and upgraded so the bookkeeper and i could use it at the same time. just disappointed...but trying to be open and learn it better.
. switch to xero even though its more expensive. better off wasting money on a useless app. cant even save a transaction. lousy support and engineering team to not resolve such a essential feauture after 1 month. subscribe at your own risk.
fix crash. my quickbooks app was crashing on my ipad 3, after i did the upgrade. press and hold the app icon and uninstall it. then, download it again. it now works.
crashing non stop. keeps crashing when trying to sign in, couldn't even use trial, useless crap, trial expired, done the usual uninstallreinstall, still didn't work
. see once after putting password and user i'd could not able to login it's coming error
. i don't usually write reviews, i always dread using the app. i have a lot of receipt that i need to add to expenses. it's a big effort to find the right transaction and add the receipt. it's painful to juggle between banking transaction and expenses. if usability of the app doesn't improve it's enough for me to pay extra and move to xero.
easy to use. makes life easy for tracking all business expenses and payments
unusable in ios 13. after login, app crashes every time. i tried deleting and reinstalling as well. ios 13.0. please fix asap.
great for keeping up with receipts!. instead of having to carry around all of the business receipts that i use, i'm able to take a quick shot with my camera upload it and then i'm all digital.
makes life easy. haven't worked through 100% of the app but as of right now it has made accounting world easier. especially keeping up to date with bank account reconciliation.
ok, room for improvement. quickbooks needs to build in a way to enter time via mobile devices. why have an app for quickbooks for mobile devices if you cannot enter your time in on the fly?
makes it all the easier. program runs excellent always active on me note 3 a couple of things id love to see added. purchase orders and file attachments to invoices this would perfect it for me.
. good app
great accounting app. i have been using this app on multiple devices, so far the ipad version is the easiest to use.
great app.
. this app is so easy to use! it has helped a ton with our new family business!
great. easy to take a payment while out at work. and they are all ways updating and improving. very good. highly recommended
great but could be greater. easy to use book work became so much easier with quick books online the only thing that i don't like is that you should be able to do everything across all platforms: ipad,iphone,laptop
demoted from 5 stars to 4. using the app on ipad and iphone for more than 5 years. dashboard has been unable to properly show invoice status for at least 3 months now. version 17.9, at least 3 updates ago? no fix yet nor response from intuit after feedback. while i’m not fond of frequent updates, one expects to have these kinds of obvious bugs fixed in the next update.
easy to use. quickbooks is great for anyone especially if you like to do your books on the move
needs more bank options. this app doesn’t support my bank (becu) si in that case it’s worthless to me. please refund my money thank you!
deceiving. silly me. i thought quickbooks had somehow released a free service. i installed this app, and the first thing i am presented with is a screen asking me to sign up for a free trial. sorry, $12.99 per month is just not worth it for quickbooks until they finally build a decent rental business module. i hate being tricked into downloading apps that are actually not free.
slow and buggy. disappointed in app. doesn't correlate well with desktop version. slow to load information and sometimes won't update accounts.
love this app!!!!!. thank you this app is amazing!
simplifies. this app makes it really easy and fast to manage receipts and expenses.
we be removing from my ipad. while it allows you to look at a couple of reports, the entries do not link to account activity, making the app useless for me. i will be removing it from my ipad.
great app!. this app makes using accounting software extremely easy and convenient! so easy to go from phone, tablet, and pc.
meh, no project profitability reports in the app. as a construction business all our accounting revolves around p&l reports per project. the onlinedesktop app gives us the project report but the app does not, which makes the app pretty much useless. our best solution is to login to our qbo account through safari on the phone to see the real time project profitability, shouldn’t the app do that?
worst customer support of all time. some of their custom support reps are amazing. some don’t even know their own policies. i’ve had several different issues with them with several different companies and aspects of their platform and i’ll never use them again and recommend anyone to check other accounting softwares out before going to quick books as future risk and frustration mitigation.
very useful mobile app. i don't expect my mobile version (android) to replace my desktop version. for checking customer balances, emailing invoices, and receiving payments it's a perfectly useful app. quick and easy access to invoices, customer balances, expenses, customer info, p&l and balance sheet. i'm not running or expecting more sophisticated reports from my phone! works great for what i need!
. really easy to use. highly recommended. would like to see payroll either included or developed separatelylinked.
description is misleading. there is no way to enter or see expenses in this app and of course no way to attach receipt pictures to these expenses. you can enter expenses using computer and attach picture of receipt there, but not in this app. if you need a plug in to do that, why not to say so? or just remove missing components from description.
. very helpful and detailed information in reports. couple functionality issues when entering credit card transactions. overall, pretty awesome
. this is seriously a great app. thanks devs
not that great for me. can't write po's...good for regular expenses banking etc...
subscription renewal poorly thought out. i have been using qbonline for more than a year. it picked the worst time to time out and demand a subscription renewal. further it requires multiple logins and you must be st your desk top. nothing more frustrating than what amounts to a software crash when you are trying to get things done. huge fail quickbooks
not very good. there seems to be issues here. a lot of errors with login on this updated app. as well as having to wait so long for funds to be deposited. not happy
update needed asap. i also have been using this app for years (it’s great when working properly) but something happened after this last update and i’m getting kicked off and signed out in the middle of my invoices and estimates. it’s staying “an important update is required” or something like that and i’ll go to update the app but it’s already updated! and i’ll log back into the app and get kicked off again with the same message.....
easier than all other apps. i literally tried out a dozen other apps trying to get one free or cheap. efforts were futile. i broke down and bought this one and never happier. it works like a charm and no dead buttons. does what i want it to do and no limitations.
small business owner. i am quite pleased with how fast and simple it is to use.
amazing. this app makes my business. hats off to the developer
new horizons glass wa. works great. do all my bidding and estimates with this app.
nice but not quite 5 stars. this is a handy app to go along with my qb online. i would give it 5 stars except it doesn't read receipts that are photographed. it would be nice if picture of the receipt could be scanned and information entered in fields automatically. ..to speed up quick entries
"works great for my business needs. i can send estimates quickly and they look professional. one feature i really enjoy is knowing my customer has viewed the estimate! occasionally the ""+"" arrow doesn't seem to respond on the app... otherwise i'm very pleased. dc"
great!. it is a very useful app however i am doing various kind of trading and i can't find a category that suit my need.
so much better. intuit have certainly listened to there customers and have massively improved the app with some recent updates. so much better and easier to use than before. well done intuit finally glad a huge company has finally listened to its customers
easy to use, no enough control. the app looks great and is easy to use. it does not however, give me basic options. one example is that i can't seem to add the cost of materials and labor for an item that i sell. only the price of the sale. i have to manually add in expenses for each item. it's tedious and doesn't give me a good reading of how my business is doing.
app issue. i've been using the quickbooks app for over 6 months and it worked fine. now, for the past week the app will not let me access my company data or the data is incorrect after multiple reinstalls. this is very aggravating and qb's customer support stated it's an ios issue. please correct this issue asap. thank you
. love it very helpful and easy to use looks very professional for estimates and invoices
quickbooks online on macbook. quickbooks online is constantly crashing while i'm creating my invoices. every time i enter a line entry i have to take the extra time to save it because the program will freeze up and i will have to force quit and restart the whole invoice over again. i rate it a 1 star only because i can't rate it any lower.
convenient accounting app. super usefull app, get you at the top of your finances, recommended!!!
terrible. glitchy. doesn't update new transactions. hard to navigate compared to desktop qbo app. honestly, intuit knows it can do better than this. they're just greedy.
excellent software. but need to make as industrial requirements. we have travel agency but it restricts us in many places. if ad travel agency options will be better.
needs more work. how about an already paid check box ? also an option for tax inclusive default would be nice. it would save half the time making an invoice if it had these options.
awful app, won't open. app was working fine until a few days ago. reinstalling doesn't fix it. app opens and a second later disappears. not good for people trying to do their accounts.
still no touch id. i used to think this was a great app, but now with these last 2 updates, i have to constantly uninstall the app and still no touch id. why when something works fine can you not just let it be. please fix back
. app is pretty much useless. pointless to have an app when i have to enter my transactions on a desktop anyway. i want general journal entries in the app (or ya know, a better way to enter my daily sales info) or my damn money back!
good app poor customer service. was trying to switch over my account settings and the representative i had helping me seemed very lost and wasn’t of any help. still confused on how to swap my account to a different package and receive refunds on duplicate charges. really quite frustrated. besides that the app itself provides the services i need.
great for tracking business and personal expenses. great app
useless. why even bother with this app? i can enter a bill from a sub or supplier on the website or the mac app but can only enter paid expenses here? i can do everything i need to do with my business on my iphone without carrying an ipad or macbook air except use the quickbooks app to enter or actually pay bills (only able to record bills already entered as paid). please fix this (or just tell us you’re not fixing it) !!!
not a replacement. not fast. doesn't sync well.. this app needs a lot of work to be reliable and usable. no matter how many times i sync it doesn't actually sync to the web apps data. it keeps logging me off the fingerprint option. this might be designed in there because human fingerprints change very often? correct?
. very useful, easy to use on mobile or pc. i have had a little trouble getting funds transferred into my account.
turnover. i just really want to know how much i’ve turned over this month. can’t see how to get this easily in this app. in the desktop version it is on the desktop. can’t find anything about this
great app. very user friendly. easy to edit and add customers.
. great app, very useful
great app. great app for busy people! this is really useful for trades people and consultants. highly recommend, super easy to use
. having a mobile office means that i am able to do invoices for the business on the run. taking payments are easy too.
slow.. not was easy as before. not much function as before. some new function was not useful
super & excellent apps. very user friendly application . i would recommend this software to other people
email is my only complaint i don't like my emails coming from into it i want to choose my own email so my customers can respond please fix this. respond it's when i'm sending invoices or estimates
don't do latest update. was working great until latest update. now i cannot create any invoices.
not reliable. app logged you out while you’re still driving or doesn’t log you when you need it to. this used to be a great app but then this glitch happen with it not logging in and logging you out when you don’t want it to and when you contact customer service there’s no help other than delete the app and redownload it relogin yeah that doesn’t work.
still doesn't work. touch id is still not working. must manually log in to the app each time i use it throughout the day. this is super annoying not to mention time consuming. and time is money!
difficult to use. makes it harder to run your business not easier.
. app data is never accurate. i hate to login via mobile web to get accurate numbers. misleading and frustrating
great for business. it's great that you can send invoices from phone. it would be even greater if it had a deposit feature. that way when you're at the bank you can just look on the app and see and check off your deposits from undeposited funds.
incomplete and not easy to use. privacy settings are lacking as they previously were in the online version. to be useful, i need to be able to pass the ipad to a sales associate sioux giving them the amount of access they currently have (with the limited privacy settings). also, the login and password system is cumbersome meaning it isn't quick to open up the app to charge a customers card (faster to run it through the online version)
zero stars if possible. i login successfully on pc but using same info i get error message saying i don't have an account. if there's no mobile app access, i wish my boss didn't require me to use quickbooks online. the desktop version + go to my pc worked fine.
love it but..... seems like new technology with some bugs. also some reciprocity issues with what can be done on app as opposed to phone. i know intuit will refine and well worth it. it is helping me streamline my business networking system!!! love it and look forward to giving a 5 star in couple years!
useless. why even bother with this app? i can enter a bill from a sub or supplier on the website or the mac app but can only enter paid expenses here? i can do everything i need to do with my business on my iphone without carrying an ipad or macbook air except use the quickbooks app to enter or actually pay bills (only able to record bills already entered as paid). please fix this (or just tell us you’re not fixing it) !!!
unable to access quickbooks through ipad. everytime time i try to access the quickbooks it says i need to verify first my login which can be verified by sending an email. when i choose this option it says the time has ran out and goes back to the login menu. i am able to get in through the web but never in the app
the phone app is practically useless. the phone app is very awkward to work with. the only think i found it useful for was just to look things up for reference. it's not worth taking the space up on my phone for that. i'm deleting.
mgrm. great app
its great. good program. needs more functionality
no bank rec?. how do i get bank rec. myob n xero do
don't believe the hype. this app is practically worthless. all important actions require you to be on the website. i need to be able to invoice, payroll, and do taxes from the app as i am hardly with my computer.
great app. helpful for small busines
glitches. app has lots of glitches. try to create an invoice and it was not working. quickbooks has been awesome up to this point. i run my whole business through quickbooks in this new update has been a disappointment. should've left it alone!
app crashes. this app crashes or cannot save my data on every entry i make. horrible app!!
. great app, works well with the desktop and online versions. great to have my financial info at my fingertips when i need it.
crashes when downloading. crashes when downloading after initial setup. have not been able to use app. disappointing.
functional. easy. efficient. beautiful.. what more can i say? i am an independent film producer that is often out of the office. i prefer this app to the web version on my laptop. wow! this app alone makes the purchase of my iphone 7plus worth every dime.
outstanding. i love the new quickbooks app it allows me to invoice and estimate my customers in a snap it also allows me to bring the point of sale in the home credit card processing is very easy also my favorite feature is that i am able to transfer my contacts into my quickbooks customer list with the press of a button
. my wife has this app and it works well for her business. i got this app based on her recommendation but unfortunately it has been full of technical difficulties. several hours wasted on talking to tech support and was told the tech team might resolve issues in a week. all details of my invoices are erased and wrong dates are shown on all invoices amongst other problems. wish they could solve this faster, has been very stressful experience so far for me.
. make estimates easier highly recommended
great for start up. the app works great! i can do nearly all of my bookkeeping from my phone. if i need more detailed i just use my laptop! the monthly subscription is nice too!
just what i needed. i run a small contractor business doing remodel work. the mobile app has been a godsend. i can track all my estimates, invoices & expenses in one place. helps me track clients that are late payers too (which sometimes happens). i like it. 100% worth the subscription
seems great so far. this is what i've been waiting for so i can invoice my jobs right on the spot. a few months on and yup this app is amazing works perfectly for what i need.
. can't log in, useless!
easy to use. generally easy to use. some limitations on app.
great app but needs improvement. there are various things you can’t do on app .example you can’t set recurring transaction, use batch actions for reminders. for indian users , they have not launched quickbooks payment. there is no customer portal ,there should be system for sending invoice and reminder link via sms overall it is good app and all does the basic stuff but should look forward to integrate above stuff as well
expenses. you cannot cost expenses to a particular job or client
can’t access. i can’t access quick books off my mobile then i am unable to access it off my laptop as well, i log in and it just does nothing on my laptop and when i log in on my phone it logs me out and says i don’t have mobile access..
. need access to qb timesheets. not integrated and really need to be for employees on the move.
um yeeaaa.... it’s kind of crappy i can’t link my bank accounts with out manually entering the transaction it kinda takes the quick out of quickbooks
. unable to see customer payment transactions and limited functionality. unable to generate detailed customer statements.
almost great. this app would be better if it had a little more functionality. i would love to be able to upload photos to invoices or even send an invoice from the app. i find myself not really using the app very much because it does not have full functionality. it would be nice if qb could mirror their web based app.
statements. can't send statements or use bundles in the app. email customer services about it and they send you a email about doing it on your desk top. been asking for 6 months to have it added to the app. just get the same response while they add useless gimmicks to the app.
. this app really is useless. i'm having to manually input all of my banking transactions because it never feeds in the real time info as it should. the layout is counter intuitive and frustrating to use. it's like they've made the app but never done any testing or had any feedback on how they can improve it and make it user friendly. my books are an incoherent mess at the moment, this app is supposed to make things easier but it's awful.
taking too long to integrate with desktop version. all the press releases state that quickbooks is usable across all platforms, it is only part usable on the ipad version and even less on the iphone. have been waiting weeks for it have full functionality on the ipad.
. its very good program keeping my books in order, reminding of unpaid invoices connects to external management software, great stuff
access. this app is great. it is so nice to be out in the field looking at a project and make an estimate right then and there while things are fresh in your mind. not to mention for the quick service call we are able to make our invoice right there and present it when we are complete with the work. aloha po'okela lawn service kailua, hawaii
app. best app
glad i got it. i got this app when my computer crashed and it was the best thing that happened to my small business
awful app.. literally the worst business related app that i have to deal with. get ready to log in every six seconds and have no changes saved when you modify things. the idiotic data entry fields do not allow you to enter information half the time. if literally anyone anywhere came up with a program that would import my contacts and records from this steaming pile of junk, i would switch.
just what i needed. i run a small contractor business doing remodel work. the mobile app has been a godsend. i can track all my estimates, invoices & expenses in one place. helps me track clients that are late payers too (which sometimes happens). i like it. 100% worth the subscription
thumbs up for the business help!!!. take the time to go through the tutorials and this is an amazing app to help with any small business!!!
. difficult to navigate. starts with fairly useless information that cannot be sorted. does not sync for days on end, so it isn't current. cannot view statements or email one from the field. edit: it is getting easier to navigate and shows more useful information.
great app. this is getting better with each update it makes. i you this app everyday to run my practice and it makes it very convenient because i'm constantly on the road and i don't have to sit at my desk just to enter expenses or send invoices to clients.
so close. please add the ability to create sharable links to invoices from the mobile app. that would be incredible
"awful app... can't even sign in. migrating to qb online so thought app would be great.. wrong! app won't sign in and reports 'communications error' in addition, it's not compatible with my 8"" tablet running android 5x  come on intuit  sort it out"
business handled from my phone. works well, update is even better. can create invoices, print, email, track and reconcile business spending. shows if invoices have been sent ( when emailing) as well as read. would give 5 stars if i were able to record bank deposits with this app. currently customer payments remain in undeposited funds until i log in to the desktop site. also wish i could save time by printing batch invoices. overall very useful, easy way to handle business on the go.
versatile and available. great for my small business that i can get clients info from a mobile platform and send invoices and sales receipts while mobile.
. great app and easy to use!
am going to give 4 stars. so far so good am enjoying this new software. only thing i can't get to work so far is printing with note 3 and printshare click the print button and it does nothing
difficulty. bad program because of the difficulty in the secret code i offer to delete the program and i do not want to waste my time in it if the secret code is difficult
great app. intuit is rewiting the eay we do accounting and genera finance for small companies, keep it ip
. good app wish it had a feature to scan in receipts otherwise it has been super helpful
made my job way easier. been really useful for creating invoices and collecting payments for our company!
great app!. this app has saved me tons of time and i love it!
. doesn't let me connect a bank account
great app. overall its a great app. you can do many things from the app that you can do on the desktop version. i would like to be able to enter the worked hours on the app and also to be able register vendor invoices not only expenses.
excellent. quickbooks online has created a whole new dimension to bookkeeping and accounting for small business. the ipad app is very useful for an overview of transactions
great accounting package. love the mobile apps!
business owner. used desktop for years and now after switching to imac and iphones this app is perfect and couldn't be easier. recommend this to anyone looking for an accounting app.
desktop to online user. qb desktop user who switched to qbo. really like the ability to use on all my computers and ios devices. just wish it would have easier reports to make and use. no time sheets feature in ios, tsheets by quickbooks fills that void.
bank connections never work. bank connections to transactions never work. always down.
really good !. used a different invoicing program for years but would not sync with quickbooks. so i went over to the best and figuring it out. quickbooks online has made it easy to work through. good job developers !! been 8 months now and have to say quickbooks online has been excellent ! not too hard to learn and very easy for my customers. a winwin
user friendly. works great!. great app for running a small business. easy to use for estimates, invoicing, accounts receivable, etc. can't wait to integrate it with our payroll to make billing for labor even easier. highly recommend.
effective app!. truly effective application.
wish we could drill down on reports. i like this app but wish that i could drill down to details on the reports. thank you for your work on this.
. typical of qbo: half baked with features always being removed so they can charge you more money for them in another tier.. leaving mostly buggy features you wont use! can't even enter time tracking?! uninstalling!!!
. limited bank support. no good for personal finance. not many german banks supported.
can not do custom invoice numbers. the app can not do custom invoice numbers. i have had the app for two months and paying the monthly fees and have not been able to send out my first proper invoice. i have asked support and they come back with instructions to go to certain settings that do not exist on the app.
quickbooks saves me time & money. this app has streamlined my business as i am always on the go. its easy, efficient and powerful! still missing critical features in international version such as online paypal payments
great app if it worked.. this app was really promising at first, but now it seems like i consistently have issues with chase bank accounts and american express accounts updating. it’s monday and sine thursday my alchase accounts say they are updated when they are not and my amex continuously has error connections. and then u call customer service and they ask you if you called amex to see why there was a connection problem. a shame.
don't believe the negative reviews!!. i think the application is a huge time saver. works great on my ipad air 2. i strongly recommend this app! it's like getting a full time bookkeeper for only $30 per month! i like having my business records semiautomated in the cloud. intuit offers a 30 day trial. why not just try before you buy? that's what i did and i haven't been disappointed.
. the previous version didnt update dashboard. this latest version does not run on my samsung s9 at all. quits with an error after signing in. i have uninstalled, reinstalled, still won't work.
not happy. this application is cheap at first, but then the price rises, now i'm paying like 30 a month, that's a lot, i found applications that are completely free.
. great program, and getting better all the time.
. quickbooks functions very well for someone who has no idea what they're doing. support is very helpful when needed.
. everything i need. just wish they'd include mileage tracking.
awful. doesn't work.. logs me out instantly every time i sign in... wish i could evaluate more. love the online version, but this app is struggling.
negative stars.... emails won't send to customers... misspelled quantity on invoices... not complicated to fix, no customer service, destroyed my management system, i regret switching...
terrible. can’t figure out who to call for support. need to cancel account but everything goes in a circle. i hate companies like this.
needs improvement. i just started using this app while traveling. it doesn’t compare to the site on my pc. very unfriendly and difficult to impossible to bring up to date.much incomplete data. need to go to work on this one of its to be useful.
. i used for years and worked great the online quickbooks. if cancelling, be careful because it has glitch and it is hard to get the refund.
. great app! very convenient. it's actually functional.
great mobile app. this app is perfect for my business. i'm out of the office majority of the day so being able to send or create estimates and invoices is very nice. quick and easy
. nice app very usful and conviniant
. in usable black screen comes for a long long time in start up and during usable on android. the worst party is that issue has been there since ages. it's like qbo is not interested in developing this app
jan 2019 update is a fail. it no longer lets you log in with your fingerprint or face id.
just crashes. has never worked period. galaxy note 4
great app. this app  software really saves my life.
better than sage. so i've been using sage for about a year now and decided to switch to quickbooks. best decision ever. quickbooks is much more simple. totally recommend it.
love this app!. i absolutely love this app. it allows me to run my business efficiently and effectively!
fantastic app for a superb product!!. i've been using quickbooks since i began my private voice and piano studio. i am able to easily track invoices and payments and send reminders to my students and their parents. the app has helped me save time when adding payments so i can focus my time on my students. i also love how i can send receipts and reminder invoices even when i am on the run! definitely a 5 star product & app!
dont work no more. terrible tech support! app quit working over a month ago...tech support is useless...you better change your advertising....you should probably get it for false advertising cause you are lying to the public
. best accounting app
plenty to be desired. there are options such as making expenses billable is not available. previously had issues with adjusting tax in the app and the support team told me to use the web based version. what's the point in having an app with features when the support team just tells you use the web version.
needs to fix bugs. i love quickbooks online and the desktop version but their mobile app needs to fix their bugs. i told quickbooks support two months ago that i couldn't email an invoice from the app and they couldn't help me fix the problem then. i still cannot send invoices from my mobile app so it is basically useless to me.
. this app is now horrible, it was great up until latest update and now i am unable to run my business using this app. very frustrating when an app takes steps backwards please help????
. no issues for me yet.
zero stars 10.3 is junk. i used this app several times a day. i run my business on this app. since april 10th i cannot access my data. my business is suffering and intuit cannot fix it. i still have to pay. tech support at intuit  quickbooks recommended i switch to a android. (i doesn't work on my iphone or ipad) i really do not want to invest in new hardware. stay away from intuit they do not care and offer no solutions.
does not function. doesn't load new invoices. app is now useless.
crap. this update is crap. my invoices won't update with the ipad. nothing like beta testing on your customers. typical for quickbooks
perfect and time saving. now i can invoice my clients from my phone when i'm with them and i can classify my transactions each time i have to wait, directly from my phone!
qb online and ios app. with the online and ios app this is exactly what i needed to be completely mobile. i can start on one and finish on the other.
loved the app until banking disappeared. i mainly use my computer to do most of our accounting but loved having the app so i could accept banking transactions during short periods of downtime thereby keeping our bank balance up to date all the time. then today i went to catch up on accepting transactions and banking has totally disappeared from the menu. help! what happened? i deleted and reinstalled the app to no avail.
easy to use, instrumental to my business. keep it glitch free please
. good mobile app for finance
. good app
. i'm amazed by how much i can do quickly in the app, but the number of touches it takes to switch back and forth between screens gets old fast. the app dies every time i switch to a different app to look up a piece of information, and when i start the app back up, it has completely forgotten what screens i was last in.
. much easier than using the mobile site on my phone and very convenient for sending invoices
. the quickbooks app has saved so much time from my life! i can send invoices while i'm traveling, see how my business is doing in a few taps, and save receipts so i don't have to keep them in a file! many more features besides these. i love it!
. great experience
can't log in?. login problems because i used turbotax. it says i already have an account but won't let me log into quickbooks because i don't have an account!?!
. often fails to sign in. limited app that hardly works. skip the download and just visit the website.
good app i’ve grown fond of. makes my life 5 times easier. definitely worth the money
okay. i'm new to doing my own bookkeeping and find this product clunky and not very easy to use. issues with importing transactions and program changing dates and the order compared to the bank. it's not very easy to see what account transfers are moving tofrom. it's hard to distinguish credits for debits. poor customer service. no good summary graphs. slow to attach receipts. multiple clicks to do basic things. cuts off file names if there too long.
great app. this program work great on my galaxy tab.
. useless app. waste of money. lousy support. subscribe at your own risk. i am cancelling mine
needs better support. i thought this was a great app then it wouldn’t allow expenses to be uploaded, one of the main reasons for using this on the mobile app, support we’re worse than useless and could give no time scale as to when this would be fixed to a small business working on the go this defeated the whole point of using a mobile app, am looking for alternatives
"not as good as it was.. getting worse. incorrect allocation of funds to invoices. the mobile app doesn't allow expense entering anymore (""we're working on it""  november 16). yes, you can see invoices and forward from the phone, but wouldn't want to do anything else. come on qb, get your act together. u.k."
. when editing an invoice, it doesn't let you scroll up to see the whole written document when your keyboard is open. galaxy s6. great other than that.
crash. crashes each time i try to add a customer. i can't do anything with it now. iphone 6
difference maker. love the program, made it much easier to price jobs, track paidunpaid invoices and keeps track of all business info
too expensive. i do to want to pay for s subscription , i just want to buy the software
". the banking feature is horrible. i hear it's a problem across the board with androids. while trying to add expenses that have been imported from my bank, the app freezes or crashes. calling quickbooks gave me a generic ""we are working on it"" response but no solution. if they didn't have the market cornered on accounting software i'd use something else. but alas, i'm stuck with the frustration and urge to throw my phone everyday."
need some updates please. the app is good fir me and easy to use .. i would like to insert in settings options to automatically change the color of the invoices every 15 20 days .let say when the invoice goes 15 days old to automatically change in yellow ,then when is 30 days orange ,45days old red and on and on and on :) ;)
. with no access to the register and a very clunky interface the app is very difficult to use. it is far from useless but also far from essential.
streamlined. makes running my business so much easier
disappointed. i just switched from my trusty iphone to an android phone, this app on my iphone was perfect! it had a list of products and services, unlike the android version. it also loaded all the estimates and invoices for all my customers, this android version hardly has any of my past transactions! please make this like the ios app!
quickbooks. does everything i need it to do
user friendly. this app is super easy to use
. mobil app to slow
unsatisfied. keeps telling me to contact support after trying to make an invoice very frustrating.
convenient. great app now i can do the books from anywhere.
covers everything. love qb love how you can work quick on the go as well, on the phone or ipad as well as computer. it can be overwhelming but customer service is always super helpful. just and over all great product.
. always displays an error when trying to connect to bank for transactions
. terrible...i am still trying to cancel the trial period...i contacted them via phone, email and followed all heir instructions amd nothing...the section to cancel doesnt exit for me ..they keep repeating the same and avoid t9 answer.
worst user experience. app is made of complex processes..i they are more focused on collecting data than providing service..uninstalled within 3 minutes
. does as promised, great extension for using quick books on the run. a must have for business over view at a glance. if your pc crashes this is your life jacket!
limited. desktop app for mac is brutal slow. mobile apps ok but limited graphic reports
doesn’t let you do self assessment tax. this app only does my business tax return, and whilst it doesn’t explicitly promise more, because it doesn’t let me do my self assessment (buy to let) it means i still need another app to do this. and an account on top. being such a major tax app, the fact it can’t deal with all my tax matters is a major fail.
. excellant app helped taking the stress out of book keeping
awesome app. i was hesitant going to the monthly subscription, but it has been awesome always having access to my business account. the app looks and works just like the desktop app on my mac.
. solid a love the mobility and ease of use for my small business. just wish i could void or cancel invoices and estimates on the app.
so so. the app is not the greatest. i've worked with better.
so helpful. my business is basically my husband and me. when we are both out of the office, it's been difficult to have to wait to help customers. this app has allowed me to to create an invoice from an estimate, accept payment and send a receipt all from the truck!
. never works. every time i log in there is always some technical difficulty. makes having an app for a busy business extremely hard. l
app is ok but expected better. i recently switched to quickbooks online as my firm is growing. the app is nice and works well. however this an accounting bug that doesn't take into account cogs for non inventory items that have a cost assigned to them when setting up the productservice. this increases our work as we have to manually enter the cost of each item sold....this is ridiculous
. i was not aware that you needed their main subscription of $25 per month to access this extra monthly charge. also i am still being charged my one month payment for thinking i could use this on my andeoid only and signing up. not impressed for a co.pany i worked with their software for years. now like microsoft, it's a money grab with subscriptions. sad. loved them for years.
great app. very nice and good
easy to use, innovative and mobile friendly. we have been using qb at australiance.com for almost a year and i would not go back to my previous accounting software. the interface with paypal works well and save heaps of time for our online sales. it s easy to create expenses (e.g. business lunches etc), quotes or invoices on the go with the app + always know your bank account position as it interfaces directly with it.
my business has transformed.. i have received multiple compliments from my customers regarding my new invoices and estimates.
. get program.
"not working. i just downloaded it and it said it was free. it sent me a verification code. when i went back to the app now it is saying i have no subscription. i wish it could have said that in the begging because now my business email is ""registered"" and i can't find a way to delete my email address from this program."
. excellent love being able to send invoices as i'm taking to customer face to face.
for a guy who is running his own business this is gold!. love how easy it is to invoice and snap receipts on the go. tracks all my invoices so if those subcontractors don’t pay i’m onto them straight away! cheers for making it so easy!
. great app. please keep your prices reasonable.
great but needs some updates. just recently i am unable to log in to my company. i can get on to my online account, but not on the app?? says my email and password isn’t found?
not working properly after update. i just updated the app and now every time i try to edit an invoice it forces me to refresh the invoice and i lose my changes. the pin number does't work, i added it again and made sure it is turned on, but i have to sign in with my username and password each time. it worked perfectly on the last update.
brilliant!. easy to use, matches payments received and ties them off with your invoices, easy to see profit and expenses for each month. well worth the monthly payment, my books have never been so easy to keep!
"works great for my business needs. i can send estimates quickly and they look professional. one feature i really enjoy is knowing my customer has viewed the estimate! occasionally the ""+"" arrow doesn't seem to respond on the app... otherwise i'm very pleased. dc"
great program. quickbooks online has become the way we operate our business. it went from being an accounting system to doing work orders, job tracking and everything in between.
subscription portal broken. infuriating support staff that don't have a clue. actually tried to make me pay a second subscription to access my data.
sssloooow so very slow. latest update takes forever to load splash screen about 8 seconds then face id happens fast then loading data: no problems. just takes for ever on the front side to get going.
makes books much easier to keep updated. this is a powerful combination of mobile, camera, and bookkeeping. much easier than relying on the desktop.
. worst app don't use it. it shows us a very professional look and feel but truth is that it doesn't work in android mobile in india and online version of desktop is totally sucks just because it is very slow. these peoples are making fool of us totally.
good but won’t take my money. every time i put my card info they charge me $1.00 and then it says subscription canceled. so i put in my info again and agin and they charge my card $1 but it never runs so i can be a member.
great app. good app. better if it had tracking of vehicle km like the self employed version
self employment. great app
. every time i send a invoice with pdf attached it says email sent pdf not
. slick app designed to make your business life better.
. was wary, but the convenience is worth a lot until the latest update. now i cant sign on. been a week since they told me there was an issue. still not resolved. spent several hours on hold listing to garbled elevator music that can not be turned down. customer support blows.
problemas con la tasa de importe. no puedo editar ni agregar una tasa o precio del artículo en las facturas ni estimaciones en iphone 7 plua
. extremely user friendly, customers love the on the spot invoices and ability to sign for and pay for work right on the spot!
. i've been trying to use this app for months and months. it doesnt work, and nobody has done anything about the problems even though there are numerous complaints and bad reviews. i'm getting ready to stop paying for quickbooks and find something else. i mainly wanted to us the app for taking pictures of receipts, but due to the syncing issues, i can't submit more than one receipt picture without the app hanging or freezing. i've tried reinstalling, clearing cache, etc. with no luck.
print checks directly from ipad. when will the update happen that will let us print checks directly from ipad?
. this app is horrible. why make something so bad? it needs a complete overhaul. i can't email receipts to an inbox, income transactions don't show gst amount like expenses, i can't view pdf receipts. it's just all round ugly and cumbersome and i've only used it for five minutes. i thought the xero app was bad but it's 5 stars compared to this trash. deleted.
. problem tried to sync my company data, refresh it. and now the app crashes as it is loading my company invoices. it seems to log in fine. just gets hung up when trying to load. was working great at the end of last year. but now it won't work....please help! i was using the app a lot. just want it to work again. p.s. i am using a galaxy s4 android 4.3 thanks!
. love being able to work in quickbooks from my phone! one of the best features is being able to take a picture of your receipt and attach it to your expenses right from your phone. makes your bookkeeping incredibly easy! wonderful customer service, love the payroll, too many good things to say about this app.!
great program. i use quickbooks on a daily basis, would recommend to any small business.
doesn't let you attach items. ....... yep, doesn't let you attach items. wtf?
. keeps crashing when entering receipts. it's infuriating. updated review 6 months later still crashes when splitting an expense. tried deleting the cache. it's useless.
new update crashes every time. new update makes me close and reopen every time for critical app updates
qbo. quick books online is a great app. the ability to have access to business data at all times is not only critical but essential for any business.
. great app. makes paperwork a lot easier.
. love it! makes my accounting software much easier. no time wasting and sent direct to the customer and most times get paid straight away. fabulous!
good to have. this app is wonderful to have. you have everything you need while on the go.
great app. this is getting better with each update it makes. i you this app everyday to run my practice and it makes it very convenient because i'm constantly on the road and i don't have to sit at my desk just to enter expenses or send invoices to clients.
worthless. i have never once been able to generate a p&l for a board meeting. the reporting function just does not work, which is the most useful part of accessing this program through a browser. also, even though i can enter a sales receipt, doing deposits from the + does not work and i am unable to make corrections that are relatively simple from the browser. this platform provides no service at all.
handy for sole trader. some things aren’t available on the app, like editing your invoices.
great app. quick books has come a long way this app it's great love it
finally. finally intuit listened and added access to account registers to this app. now my accounting program tells me how much money i have, owe and are owed. thanks!! once the new online interface harmony is 100% compatible on mobile devices this app can finally go away for good.
poor. if you write a review and the nickname is taken you have to start all over again. app is very limited and web version has problems with ipad pro
. does not work in india. restarts the phone . takes too long to uninstall
owner. has bugs but no more back ups .no more lost files
nice but buggy. first i'd like to thank you for a great app that makes my business easy on the go! needs some attention but on my s5 it doesn't appear in the multitask list and my friends iphone has the ability to match bank feeds also which is missing on my android?
please: give us delayed charge already!. how many times do we have to ask? for the love of gawd, why can i not add a delayed charge on the mobile app?????? this is something you actually want to do when you're at a client, not get them to sign for an invoice every time you visit them during the month.
exactly as described. it does what it is supposed to. i am a longtime user of the desktop version and still do, however for a fledgling small business that is mobile the online version is incredibly convenient.
good app. excellent
handy for sole trader. some things aren’t available on the app, like editing your invoices.
great!. continues to impress and improve on this very useful app. i use it daily for bids, invoices and expenses. the addition of the ability to record expenses and photograph receipts has made my life so much more easy. and to be able to quickly add clients, easy estimates and quick invoices and finally receive payments is unbelievable and wonderful.
"issues. it was working fine on my ipad up until last week. then starting bugging. not all customer transaction appear on the mobile app. called customer service about it. they told me that they were ""working on it"". we shall see. i pay for it monthly...i asked if i still had to pay this month even though it's not working as advertised...answer was yes. not happy with that answer. i will keep you posted. bob"
easy to use.. quickbooks online is such an easy package to use. great for small or large companies.
. this is a great app! makes billing expenses and invoicing so much easier!
broken. can’t save any new invoice sales receipt... ipad pro iphone xs max nothing works
it could use some improvements. i would like to have the option to send partial invoices from the app
. they did a great job on this app. it's easy to use and i'm able to do all of my invoicing on my phone or tablet.
lost a key feature!!!😡. update is great except they took away the option when creating a new customer to use a contacts info that's on the device.
. easy to use & productive... few features of the webpage version are not available on the app such as print or downloading packing slip, can't prepare a purchase order, etc. but overall, the app is helpful. thanks.
great app. there is no other app like it. this is probably one of the easiest apps to use and it is very userfriendly. i use it for my business and i have instant access on my iphone. you can send invoices on a moments notice.
. great app
keep crashing. after last update keep crashing. doesn’t launch the app please fix asap
easy to use. really like the app because i can keep up with accounting on the go for my business.
ability to get paid, in my pocket. if all the quickbooks app allowed me to do was create and send invoices on the fly, i would pay for it. it is that and a lot more.
not working properly after update. i just updated the app and now every time i try to edit an invoice it forces me to refresh the invoice and i lose my changes. the pin number does't work, i added it again and made sure it is turned on, but i have to sign in with my username and password each time. it worked perfectly on the last update.
not impressed. started using the app because it was recommended to install it with quickbooks online. the app does not show any up to date transactions that were entered on the quickbooks desktop version, you cannot search by phone number or address only customer name in the app also. i would have thought the app would have been more useful to use while out in the field.
app doesn’t recognize credentials. this app worked well for me until the most recent update. now i cant login, says can’t find the account with this emailpassword. this is very annoying since i travel frequently without a laptop. now i’ve lost the ability to access my accounts via the app.
roofing business. i have been using quickbooks for almost a year for my husband roofing business and i love it! why we are out looking at jobs i can do an invoice on my phone and email it right away to the customer! and i can go home and work from laptop as well! i recommend quickbooks for book keeping for business!
. not sure if this was resolved but in reviewing past expenses and invoices, it looks like 85% have disappeared. if i entered more than 1 expense on a single day, it kept 1. some days i entered 56 receipts if not more and now i'm redoing them all. switched to a bookkeeper this year so haven't used the app in 6+ months.
convenience. i really love the convenience and accessibility of this app and quickbooks online. since switching from desktop pro to this i've been able to keep up with paperwork in the field. i think it's great. i just wish they made an upgrade so i could automatically subtract expenses from specific jobs. having everything separate is a real hassle.
. if you can go anywhere else please do. i'm not sure how thet can, whether it was one person or a group of people in qb, but they consistently took money from our account. with our attorney we are in the process of getting the issue resolved. do not use qb.
app crashes after each action. i use the desktop version most of the time but when i need to use it when away, it’s really frustrating that the app shuts after every action making doing anything painfully cumbersome.
. cannot login from mobile
opens the closes. after the last update of quick books i can not access it on my ipad. there for it is costing me money. i hit the app it opens the closes right back. i have uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it is the same thing. i have 3 jobs i did today that i could not take payment on because of this. please fix asap
unable to signin🙅. moto g turbo : error says i don't have online subscription,reported via email, no response😡
"can't add unit with quality and rate in invoice. online version does not allow customisation of fields. invoice doesn't show ""unit"" with quantity and rate as a result invoice are unusable in real world. hope developer address these issue at priority before we users move to other applications."
. absolutely fantastic. easy to use and tailor to your needs
lousy service. spent all morning trying to upload an expense only to be told i had no internet connection. can't it determine i have no server connection? so most of the morning i spent in one que after another and finally hanging up. i must say that the convenience of being mobile outweighed the inconvenience of not having too much versatility, but only if i am able to be mobile. i hate wasting time, and so i want payback.
great accounting software. perfect for small business owners with less knowledge of the accounting world. very user friendly.
. does all of my accounting. great app
all the essentials in an app. works good so far. allows for quick sorting of transactions and gives all of the essential components for a mobile version. it would be nice to be able to work in budgets in app.
great app. really happy and love quickbooks
great app!. 2 thumbs up!
love it. love the app, really intuitive!!! and great customer service!!!
. zero! the app says it needs to update, then brings me to a screen giving a choice of uninstall or open. if i choose open, i'm back to the need to update. if i uninstall and reinstall, that's just more steps before i'm back to the same useless place. garbage software. update: this was a problem they had seen and were working on. they fixed it and informed me of the fix a few hours later. working now.
. good app for startup
waste of time. glad i haven't gotten past the trial offer because nothing syncs with my quickbooks online. so the obvious question is what's the freaking point of this app? completely unimpressed. someone's making money off of doing nothing. wow. i want that job!
. for the entrepreneur on the go, this app is fantastic. i post my expenses with photos of receipts and create invoices from the car! terrific.
. ive been in business for years greatperfectawesome...invoices on the smartphone that save accross all devices!
limited functionality. the app has very little of the on line functionality. and the on line version of qb has less functionality than the desktop pro version that i used previously. very much regret going to the on line version.
won't save receipts. try to record receipts in expenses, just get error message. called the number the message had, person they don't offer support for mobile devices or their app.**** update i did as you requested the day you requested and to date have not heard back from your staff. same issue with samsung 10.1 tablet and s6 phone.
. best app for tracking my personal expenses easily.
jtw1234567. awesome app. i don't have time to do all of this and run my business too.
really frustrating app. very frustrating app both on iphone and qbo. very glitchy and customer support is terrible. if the they didn't force you to use a subscriptionbased model, i'd use the installable version on quickbooks. i'm sure other have less problems, but it has not been a good experience for myself or my company.
doesn’t have my bank. doesn’t have major banks in my country so can’t use it.
help. hate trying to get help this way, but my app keeps crashing. i love my online version, but basically i can’t do anything with the app. would make my life so much easier if i could
great for pimpin. i keep track of all my hoes daily sales & expenses with quickbooks.
excellent online software. i love this system made my job a lot easier my phone is my office
easy to use. no training necessary. links to desktop. love it
i can't stand this program. logins don't work most of the time. functionality is severely limited (no expense tracking, no bill entry?! seriously). crashes regularly. horrible customer service.
. needs more function like the web based app
drafting estimates. when drafting estimates, system should auto save as many times hours of work is erased if you don’t constantly save before stepping away. in addition when you click the description box there should be an undo button in case it grabs all the text and it gets erased by pressing any button in accident. two very simple and logical things.
. great app
saves so much time. i got this app to help save time and it does. it took awhile to set up and i have had to phone for help a few times and they have been fab. i can send invoices and receipts form my phone. i am able to keep up to date on my accounts without the effort.
payroll missing. the app is great for invoicing, receipts etc however it lacks the ability to do payroll which becomes a hassle for what i need it for.
. great app for tracking expenses and payments
great for small business. it's a great app for small business. since it's a cloud solution, cheap and easy to access your finances from any where. need improvement to have detailed views and reporting for the management.
awesome app!. makes keeping up with my business' cashflow situation from anywhere in the world a breeze!
quickbooks online. very good application and it's a very matured application, if only it can support arabic text it will be very suitable to people in this region as well.
. it's a great app but i wish it could do bank recs and have a little more of the web functionality. at least i'm able to do basic billing.
needs improvement. i love the desktop version but my app version and even the online version never works right! there is always something that doesn't work. i always go through the whole estimate or invoice and then it won't save it for me! very frustrating and i wish they could work out all of the kinks.
awesome!!!. fantastic and love how much this program does for you. very simple to use.
login. i am not able to login.
do not update to ios 13. if you rely on the app, don’t update to ios 13 until they make it compatible. it crashes on startup after face id.
. me gusta, tal vez deberia tener version en español.
works well. it crashes and freezes every now and then which is annoying but it usually works very well. it's a very helpful app for my business
. does not work in india
. 1720 update  i had used the mobile app for android for quite a long time with no issue and then approximately one month ago after an update the dashboard no longer has any information and is blank. i can still see activity but there's no way to get to customers or any of the other functions. i've emailed previously with no response. previous review: works well for viewing quickbooks info and taking payments
. the invoice creation option is incredibly useful
multiple crashes. multiple crashes when trying to add expenses on the iphone.
. very professional app
ipad perfect until ios 8.5. app hasn't worked since 8.5 update. have sent several request about the app crashing and no one has gotten back to me. i've deleted and redone loaded, rebooted ipad, etc. when not crashing it's a 5 star app. please fix asap!
. they just did a huge update and didn't change any of the items i'm having problems with. the app is useless to me with line items abbreviated. how do i know what i'm entering?
best app for organizing your small business!!. only had this for a couple of days now and just invoiced my first clients. it was so easy to use. i wish it could be personalized more but still overall a great start to my business!
app constantly glitches and it's very slow. i've had so many issues with this app. lately it has been extremely slow, it randomly shuts down for no reason in the middle of inputting a transaction and it won't load larger invoices. i'm very disappointed as i use this on a daily basis for my business.
i love quickbooks online. i love quickbooks online & my accountant does also. this app is really good for doing your expenses on but as far as invoicing i still do it on the computer. it's very handy for a small business. the fact you can enter an expense, take a picture of the receipt & go on your merry way. i'm sold.
. well after the experience so far it's great when i need to merge all apps at home then i can rate better. customer service has been just awesome so far. thanks it makes tracking expenses easy as taking a picture and putting the irs info in.
. easy and quick to use for estimates, invoices , receipts and keep track of expenses and income
good stuff. the phone app is a good resource that compliments the desktop app. i have been using qb online for several years and have found that it meets my business needs as a small consulting company with less than 10 employees.
great app. been using for over a year now for keeping track of time for my construction business. works great
i would not recommend. 1. very very very expensive 2. not intuitive and not user friendly 3. no local support or live support from malaysia
really helpful. i now send me my invoice as soon as i finish my job and get paid immediately.
wonderful app!!!. couldn't sing the praises high enough. i run a small, single member managed llc and the quickbooks online app is everything i need. i can create and send invoices and sales receipts on the go, even have the customer sign right on my iphone or ipad.
. great app
. live this app
the worst customer service ever. don’t waist your time. trust my word
. great app
excellent app. cool app to have. no accounting experience needed.
superb accounting app. the only mobile app i recommend if you are into real estate. it makes my job as a small real estate owner easier and smarter. thanks quickbooks for this amazing app. great job on maintaining it. cheers! 👍🥂
useful tool. very convenient. it's good to not have to log around a laptop everywhere. instant access from anywhere. i love this. great idea!
. great to have accounting info at your fingertips. only sometimes wish i could get more info from the app but it had all the basic stuff.
. this is a great app and makes it easy to do so many parts of your bookkeeping through your phone. quickbooks online has been such a useful tool, and this is a great part of its use.
. almost 2 weeks now the app has not been working. the dashboard is just totally blank. im having to take a toptop to work and tether off my phone.
it's scam don't download 19.99 per month they took from my account. i just did download almost 8 month ago this app they took from my account almost 19.99 per month after cancel also they are robbing very bad don't download at all even no customer service to help you to talk also bad bad super bad
. awsome. able to do almost everything on my phone. i literally only use my phone and have done just fine. have only had to use a computer for some settings but other than that it's wonderful. easy to operate . 👌
google auth broken. can’t login to my account using google auth.
custom invoices & estimates. this is a bad design
quickbooks app. i find this app to be the most useful app on my phone to run my yard care business due to be able to add jobs that have been done right on my phone to make it easier to remember what's been done
good application. very useful and handy app. thanks qb
. great app
. great and simple to use, whether using the computer or phone.
. disappointed!!!! what i need is the ability to download and accept new banking transactions, while on the go. having that ability would allow me to spend only a few minutes everyday updating my books, versus having to sit down at a computer to do this. please add this functionality to the android version of qbo. i can do it on the mint app, but not qbo for android : (
simply the best. simple and easy to understand and use. above all, the free technical support is out of this world. go for it, you cannot go wrong.
new update horrible. it's always been glitch but since the new update i can't add products to the estimate and customer service is clue less in how to resolve the issue.
. very easy app to use, helps keep all my expenses organized.
. working great, really makes it simple
expensebill data missing in app. expense and bill data is not available in the iphone app while accessible online. what is the meaning of the app when i can't see any of my vendor bills or company expenses. development team???
great mobile app, but it has a mind of its own. i've found the ability to work remotely as a great plus for estimates, electronic invoices and checking customer records. i have just had issues with downloaded deposit amounts and matching for reconciliation. automatic entry into register has to go!
". i laughed at one of the quickbooks employees response to the app being slow... they said their goal is to make it as convenient as the qbo app... lol lol bad comparison. online version is tragically slow, short of (what should be) obvious capabilities, even some quickbooks older versions have had for years. and, when challenged, their tech support essentially says ""we are quickbooks if you don't do it our way or using our workaround then you must be doing it wrong"""
kiss. keep it simple stupid as they say, this app is brilliant, simple, easy to use a great for a small business that just wants everything in one app at their fingertips. well done team.
great on the go!. not as detailed as i would like but does the job!
. amazing app . makes my business bookkeeper free. defo recommend
another quickbooks app. it gets super frustrating that you guys keep making us download a new app so you can start your reviews over. now your new app doesn’t recognize my account i have to sign in and out multiple times for it to actually load my data
experience getting worse. entering transaction requires way too many taps. it isn’t location aware to suggest transactions you just always search. recent updates have some bug that makes the app download the data file with almost every login and login often you must. usually twice a week it loses my password. i have enjoyed quickbooks online but this app experience may have me evaluating competitors in december.
clumsy, slow, crashes often. not a great app, times out saving transactions, sometimes saves them, sometimes not. not worth the money
. excellent accounting software for my small business. keep up the good work.
not bad however. could we have a fingerprint scan to open the app as a measure of security please!!!
. leaks your info to several malicious ip addresses. including facebook. sad but true. (no root firewall app)
unreliable. i don't advice anybody to download this app it had a major problem since two months and till now not solved.
fix the app!!!. this app use to work great until the last update! please fix asap!
. very happy with this product
. i've downloaded this app, uninstalled it, and reinstalled it and it will not allow me to create an account. it continually signs me out and i have to reenter all my information. i'm giving up!
needs lots of work. very hard to use app. many options are hidden or unavailable so you are stuck and wind up doing the work through a browser instead
capturing expenses? approving transactions?. really nothing no support for the consultant on the go? why can't i shoot a picture of a receipt put a dollar value a catagory and a note and have it either for review or added to my expenses. what about my transaction list i can't see the same information from the full website here at all. throw us a bone man....
good but could be better. many features that are online, you cannot use in the app. even the online version is limited.
. app don't update with bank account need to use desk top
pool guy. quickbooks forced me to update from our quickbooks mobile windows invoicing system to quickbooks mobile with only five days notice. this was very poorly planned by quickbooks and put us in a bind. however the new quickbooks mobile online system is truly fantastic and offers many more powerful features and ease of accessibility. recommendation: this app needs the ability to create a monthly statement that i can email from my phone to my customers. currently i can only do this from a laptop.
perfect for my small business. i am a wedding photographer and quickbooks online is the best way for me to keep track of my expensesrentals and write up a quick invoice or estimate while i am on the road. i absolutely love how user friendly it is. as long as i have my smart phone i can work from anywhere.
. does not work with marshmallow 6.0
". worst backend support ever! the engineers are unable to resolve a simple ""save"" feature which is a necessity in all softwares. and when they cannot resolve, they just shut you off by sending you a thank you email. waste of time and money. unreliable and lousy support try it at your own risk"
garbage. app stinks
owner. great app to take of of business anywhere i'm at!
i'm an accountant. it make my life sooooo easy...live doing accounts from the swimming pool with a cocktail in a hand and phone on other ;) i❤technology
. info lost. i was using the service for my business last year and started in march. in november the app crashed. when it did all my saved receipts mileage and info was lost. i can't even login any longer. when i called they said there is no support for the app except online. so i cant even speak to a rep. so all my info gone and i'm still being charged for a year and a half now for a service that never existed.
fair at what it does. still lacks time entry, which remains a problematic task for new and occasionally seasoned employees using our tablets on the shop floor since qbo time entry mode does not support mobile browsers and uses a antiquated interface. can not issue or do anything with po's. will not refresh bank data (from bank).
won't allow adding services to invoice. i called tech support because i could not create an invoice for a customer. they had me uninstall & reinstall qbo app. it still wouldn't work. he said they're aware of the problem. it's still not fixed a week later.
". so broken that the ""report an issue"" button doesn't even work. login takes multiple tries, vendor activities are all empty, clearing cache does not help, android back buttom exits the app without even a confirmation. as much as i enjoy using the website, this app is pure frustration."
outstanding. love it
no place for attachments. when i first opened the app i was so excited. i have been a quick book user for years and now everything is available at a touch from my ipad. but the only thing that was missing was a place to put attachments from the banking screen. so bummed hope this gets an update with the attachment feature.
. very handy for a lanscaper on the go. now i can email invoices as soon as we are finished right from my smartphone, wether i'm standing next to the customer or in the truck. makes my life easier
essential sme tackle. intuit recently upped their game quite dramatically with the reworked online interface, which is extremely slick and intuitive (no pun!)... or at least as intuitive as double entry accounting software can be for the layman... if they added the ability to set different product pricing structures for different customers and a decent cash flow projection tool, i reckon i could justifiable give it five stars.
brilliant mobile app. it has changed my life . i am able to do quotes in the run and save so much valuable time .
very good application.. i like to have this application for my business. is very help and accurate for my status of my invoices pending of payment and the aging of the customers transactions thank you for mobil quickbooks very grateful.
. love the invoice function on this app
qb makes me look good. qb app is fantastic. i can write and present an estimate right at the job site or give my customer an invoice, or accept payment. in brief....it makes me look good!
. update has not fixed this issue! why can't i see bank account details in the app? you can on the ios app contacted help desk who couldn't help! without access to accounts the app is effectively useless. i have done everything you suggest. home screen is now blank! so even worse than when i started. i have also contacted support with no solution as yet.
great app.. great app
love this app. the app links straight to your computer so you can send quotes, invoices etc on the move. this is a great small business tool at a great price.
stops working too often!. not a bad way to do your estimates in the field and send out invoices but your app stops working way too often for us company wide!!!
can’t accept transactions. latest update broke ability to match transactions. it’s like that screen is locked accept buttonsearch or selecting another expense doesn’t work.
great on the go. i absolutely love using this app, lets take my office on the road!
loved it. its very useful app to track expenses and invoice.
extremely limited. to be honest, this app does almost nothing i would want it to do. if all you want to do is record payments or call a business contactgreat. if you actually want to keep up with your business (banking, reports, employees, payroll, etc) on the go, this app is near useless. i can't imagine why you would pay to use this. even free i am deleting right away so it doesn't waste any more of my time or space.
. quickbooks has always been a great product
. not bad. there is a bug when trying to display the contents of an invoice. when that is fixed, i will give it 5 stars. update  the bug seems to be fixed.
. best program and online service i have ever used.
great product. it's much easier to navigate, user friendly and worth every penny. the only con for me is not being able to switch between companies.
i like it. i still like it. i don't know all of what has changed yet but i think it is easier for me to get around that before.
please fix. we use quickbooks constantly. it has enabled us to grow at a much faster rate, helped us keep our books in order, and allows us to take online payments easily. however, the recent update has been causing the app to close unexpectedly and also has many other glitches. please fix intuit. we are not hating on quickbooks, but this is the worst update we have ever seen.
efficient app. as a bookkeeper i use qbo for all of my clients as well as for my personal account. it just keeps getting better and better. accepting transactions is a breeze as is setting up invoices, paying bills, and writing estimates. one feature my clients find helpful is the receipt attachment. i would highly recommend this app for anyone who uses qbo.
outstanding app!. owning a small business has enough headaches as it is. with quickbooks, estimating and invoicing projects and services couldn't be easier! everything is streamline! here's a look inside my day to day as a landscaper using quickbooks: initial client meeting> estimate delivered before i leave the property.. bam! they call back that night or the next day and we have the job. after we finish the project, turn that estimate into an invoice on site.. bam! paid! $$ in the bank!
. lots of odd problems. invoices dissapering invoices with same number invoice not adding correctly.
mobile app. not happy. i am on the phone with support everyday. won't print on app or on chrome. they don't know what to do. this mobile is worthless to me. i don't have time for this!
sync problema.... does not sync transactions with business bank and credit card unless you login to the quicbooks website...i have to login to the website all the time to use the app..what good is the app..disappointed that such a well funded company can have such a poorly developed app
. more nicer with the update but i still can't give my customers discounts, i wish it would let me make a negative quantity or rate while making and invoice.
. one of the best accounting software's i have used for my business on the go.
. the app use to work fine but since last month i can not update any invoice in the app. it keep givig me error unable to edit. there was adding this invoice. if this problem continues please call customer care. i have uninstalled and installed saveral time no luck.
. great app
crashes constantly. i hate the mobile app so much. i will be talking with a customer and try to pull up their account and then it will freeze and crash. the worst.
quickbooks online app. although i do like quickbooks online, the mobile app version is horrible. i downloaded and logged in and it did give me my balance sheet, but said i had no expenses, i could not find a way to put in a journal entry and other reports showed zeros as well. i deleted it from my ipad and will just use the nonapp version ( which you need google chrome vs safari to work properly not a big deal but a bit odd).
. if you have a card associated with your phone.......... the free trial will automatically charge you!!!!! and ........... the is no real way of deleting your account!!!!!!!! i've called, chatted, went into google play & can't do it from there either. when you call, if there was no card added to the account, that still doesn't mean that your card won't be charged thru the card on your google account!!!!!!!!
good for on the go business#. great app for mobile business. lacks some of the functionality of desktop version. i like the way i can record every transaction on the go, even invoices and payments. i don't like the fact that you can run only one business per subscription. much to expensive to pay separate for subscriptions if you have more than one business.
what happened to this app??. the quickbooks app used to be a 5 star, user friendly, reliably functional app. since december this app has had issues with freezing, crashing, randomly logging the user out and overall has ran extremely slow. i’ve noticed this on the app for mac as well. while trying to run a business, it would be really nice to have a working invoice and bookkeeping app. please fix this
can't match bank transactions reliably. the only reason i use this app is to match bank transactions when i have some 'down' minutes. lately, they keep getting kicked back to me, so i have to match them on my pc anyway. also, you don't have access to both memo and description, so your notes don't appear in reports if you add the transaction though a bank connection.
where's suppliers gone. since update app does not show suppliers or let you add expense
fantastic app. easy to use and works very well.
needs work!. not very user friendly... makes me download my companies data every time i login and takes forever and sometimes crashes while downloading it so have to restart the download again. qbo is great but they really need to work on the app cause i could really use it when on the road. but incapable due to its functionality at the moment.
need an important upgrade. i love the app and all the updates but we really need to information from journal entries to show up in the expenses on the app. it shows up on a computer but the app gives us false information.
. great app...has issues every now and again but easily fixed with tech support!
quality product. i've just taken over the accounts for the business with little experience and knowledge and i have found quickbooks online very easy to use. issuing invoices and running payroll is quick and simple. the support is extremely good too from professionals who know what they are doing not just anybody in a call centre reading a script.
junk  plagued with issues. this is is great when it works, but is plagued with bugs. as of recently it logs me out to “refresh,” then when i log back it it tells me the account doesn’t exist. i fix this i have to delete the app and reinstall it, every, single, time. and their customer service is terrible. they never have any solutions.
please support iphone x & faceid. please support full screen resolution on iphone x and faceid
works and convenient. easy way to enter sales and expenses. i've had no problems with this app.
awesome ap for a handyman. emailing my client the invoice or receipt is effecient and impressive. being able to enter expenses when they occur saves me office time. only fall back is i cant yet enter store charges.
. so far total garbage app. i connected my app to my qb online account. i opened the app. snapped 3 receipts. camera worked well isolating the receipts. after that totally useless. despite a new tab appearing in my banking section online i cannot find the receipt copies in either the app or online. i really needed one to return a product. qb cs of no help.
can’t use properly  soooo slow. i can’t use qbo app properly, the application is so slow, unable to load my data on my mobile (wifi lte network)
small electrical business. this software is perfect for anyone starting a business. it keeps everything organized from billing to customer records.
very nice app. easy to use makes life lot easier and saves time
"i can' t even register. ""server error "" i've sent emails and "" reported the issue"" but no response. i've used desktop quickbooks for years and was hoping to have the convenience of qbo on my phone. but now i think i'll just start looking for another online program"
app crashes constantly. i used to love this app. the last couple of months the app crashes daily and multiple times. i’m in the middle of working and the app says critical updates are needed and logs me out. i’m extremely frustrated with this considering i pay over $20month to use this software across all my devices.
. so, right up front, why not disclose the cost for the app after the 30day addiction period?🙄 google pixel 2 xl.
. very easy to use and really great accounting app
perfect. best thing going! i love being able to invoice on the move
worthless. so cluncky so slow impossible to make an invoice unless you want it to take a half hour to create one.
awesome. this app is great and extremely helpful with my small business. it saves a lot of time and work. not only do i find it very resourceful but it's easy to use. customizing my invoices and estimates is probably the best part of the application aside from it allowing me to check my profit and loss. i recommend this app to any user, especially a business owner.
great. great app, ensures all my needs and saves me time so that i can be out in the field more often
best business app. quickbooks has definitely made running my business much more efficient and has made it easier to close on deals. the estimate tool makes it easy to send professional looking estimates to clients, and with a click, those estimates turn into invoices. you can receive payments through quickbooks as well. add the payroll service and you can run the whole business yourself. i would definitely recommend this to any new business start up.
easy and convenient. it actually made recordkeeping fun! and i can stay current instantly from my truck.
incredibly glitchy. the app is glitchy despite updates. i’m not super impressed by intuit in general. i use their payroll for my business, a lot of glitches there too. app crashes or spontaneously exits my selections to “accept” for no reason and i have to start over. does not learn well, i have to reteach things over and over.
this is useless for invoicing. useless: on the product list it only shows first two words and the ..... i have multiple variations in same item. i can’t search product with sku, when i search by name it only shows first two words and then dots. i cant add the exact product on invoice. so its useless.
glitchy, incomplete features, and poor data. this app needs serious attention. after years of putting up with this hot mess i’m fed up and rarely use it any more. no matter what i do i can’t get data to load that is any more recent than 2016 for most vendors. no one from tech support replies  ever. american express transactions can’t be synched or approved in the app. about the only thing it’s useful for is matching typical transactions in our checking account.
. convenient, but i wish i were more familiar with business accounting. not for beginners.
. app keeps closing right after opening even after uninstalling and then installing and also clearing app cache and data. the only update available to me is the 19.5.2
. like many other i can no longer log in to the app, spoke to barbara on chat via the browser version and she seemed unaware of the problem despite several reviews mentioning it. otherwise i like the app (when it works!) although there are less functions than desktop. good particularly for scanning bills but can't do that at the moment...
useless. just as useless as the old 'mobile site.' you can't do anything with it! quickbooks: please make an app that can do something!
qb makes me look good. qb app is fantastic. i can write and present an estimate right at the job site or give my customer an invoice, or accept payment. in brief....it makes me look good!
service is great to use but.... i do like the service but don’t like that they have increased pricing 3 months me into using the services. now i have to transfer all my data to another program since i do not like the increase.
extremely disappointingfrustratingnon user friendly. qb online has been very disappointing. the quickbooks apps for ipad and iphone are incapable of accomplishing anything. it has been very very frustrating and i would not recommend.
. great app
great app. love this app!
. very miss leading and is nothink like the tv advert. not to easy to use and over all disappointed. having to use it because of my accountant. no impressed!!!! also no english call centre's! you can't understand the customer help line team as there english is poor. needs english call centres employing english to overcome this problem!!!!!
. limited in what the app can do...
easy and interlink. quick book is easy to use and able to interlink between my office pc with smart phone, ipad as well as bank accounts. it is making our accounting procedures easy.
loads of bugs since updating to ios 13. broken links. can’t call up customer information. dashboard only shows banking information. invoices and estimates haven’t saved when generated on mobile device.
. not for indian. can register as i am from india
. great app
. 2 weeks into using this app it has made itself unusable, going back to paper invoices thanks quickbooks!
excellent. i been using quickbooks in various versions since 1996. i upgraded to online in 2015. as i am a working at customers premises, sometimes 15 different a day, the instant invoicing using my iphone saves me having to sit at my office at the end of the day invoicing. another great thing about online is to check any outstanding invoices from customers who request unscheduled visits.
quickbooks. this app is excellent and the version on my computer is even better save's me hours when quoting well worth the money and it's also good for on site reference
. this just turned into a must have app
i love this app. easy to use, transfers well from computer to cell phone. absolutely love it.
everything i hoped & more. we switched to quickbooks with the hope of having a quicker, easier and more efficient way to keep our books. it is everything we hoped for and more. i love ability to go paperless on delivery tickets, signatures and po's. all of which can be done paperless. greg nees, owner cisco tool, inc.
easy to use. well set out and easy to use
. does some things great others not so much awefactor on some things... fail on others
worse than useless. i downloaded this app as use quickbooks daily, the pc software is great! the apple app is such a waste of time, i can’t access any reports and the info it does show me is a waste of my time just a load of numbers that don’t mean anything. no thought has gone into this app i suspect it’s just a tick box exercise creating an app...
iphone app is the worst. the iphone app doesn't work. their customer service people admitted it doesn't work. don't even try to use it  too frustrating and a big waste of time. online version and ipad versions are good but too limited for price  reports can't compare year over year
organized. been in business for 20 years and been using this app for a year. love it. still lots beyond my abilities and i wish there was a little more help in the app for the accounting inept like me but i just bring the app to my accountant and they can pull all the data needed. recommend it. see sales, cost, accounts receivable at any given moment.
. does what it says on the tin
nothing works for me. nothing works for me with this app. if i login using desktop, qbo is ok but when i use the app, there is no information; no clients, no invoices, nothing. the subscription says i have a free trial until 2037. phone support was unsuccessful.
the android app is so diffrent than the ios app.. ios app has the functionality to select multiple items too an estimateorder with the multi select feature. this is missing in android. also before the update, the send comand asked the way we wanted to send the invoice and we can select email, fax application. but with the update it only send with the quickbooks email. cant send by fax anymore. please provide the share option on invoice and estimates atleast.
didn't work for me. kept getting an error that i don't have an online account. yet it asks me to verify and gives me my cell or email to verify with.
. having trouble switching the email account i want to use with this app. it keeps defaulting to my phone email.
great app!. easy to use, syncs nicely. very user friendly and keeps me informed while on the go!
. great now i can do alot of my office work while in the field. this app lets me have more time making money instead of sitting at home on computer.
super & excellent apps. very user friendly application . i would recommend this software to other people
can't match bank transactions reliably. the only reason i use this app is to match bank transactions when i have some 'down' minutes. lately, they keep getting kicked back to me, so i have to match them on my pc anyway. also, you don't have access to both memo and description, so your notes don't appear in reports if you add the transaction though a bank connection.
great app. great app
. very useful and easy to use
. this app is perfect for my business. love it!
app shows incorrect transactions. transactions do not match the selected vendor. works when you have few transactions. once you pass 20k it becomes slow and inaccurate.
. consistent app
needs improvement. supplier side is useless, plz improve, thanks
great to use on the go!. love this app. i use it alongside the website, this is on my phone. it's not as easy to navigate around as the website but it's not intended to use totally on its own. i love being able to send invoices whilst doing other things  really helps me to consolidate my time.
. good app very good addition to qb online really convenient. no issues or problems so far and seems quite secure. simple to use
"update broke the app. since the update i have to type my password each time i open it after it has been closed for a while. this doesn't work in front of customers. (yes, i enabled touchid. the problem seem to be hitting others and is based on now intuit decided to ""fix"" touchid by breaking it in this version)"
user friendly  no need for anything else. this is an amazing app to use on all devices with my quickbooks online package. managing all aspects of my business from wherever i need it. highly recommended.
ran into unsupported transactions within 1 minute. very disappointing. it seems like the app isn't complete.
no complaints!!!. 👍👍👍👍the first business app ever that i'm unable to find anything wrong with. my boss & i love it. it's incredible how close this app comes to the qbo full website in terms of what we're able to access and accomplish using it. leaves all competitors in the dust. keep up the good work qbo!!!
perfect software for the right companies. i absolutely love it! i have a small freelance design company, so i'm billing for services and commissions. there is nothing i need that it doesn't do and do well. i don't need inventory, estimates or payroll, so this program is about as friendly to me as it could possibly be.
owner. quickbooks has !ade it simple to take care of my business. thank you
easy to use but missing some features. it's a great app but missing some features. i need to see quantity for my products and be able to create purchase orders from vendors and receive inventory.
user. good app but needs more features
crabbywyatts llc. great tool has made my life easier.
stuck in data download. can't open app on ipad or iphone. stuck in a data download loop. support says there are no known issues, what a joke.
handy. the mobile app is very convenient for entering expenses on the go. you can add photos of receipts and create new customers and suppliers easily. profit & loss and balance sheet function gives you a quick snapshot of your business. overall, the app is quite handy to use for small businesses.
easy to use. great system, much cheaper than other accounting systems, user friendly and plenty of help if you do get stuck. definitely 5 star
useless app. used to a quickbooks user a couple of years ago, and it was ok then, but now i have recently returned and find it rubbish. a simple thing like adding a company address is turning out to be an impossible task. total waste of my time. it you are a small business using the app via iphone or ipad forget it. stay away
so easy to use!. love how simple and easy this is to use, love how it all connects to my paypal account too
. great app. awesome app!
. this is of great help! i can update our business transactions anytime, anywhere! thanks! 😊
. fantastic app!!! reliable and extremely convenient
utter crap. if i could give no stars i would app crashes all the time won't send invoices to customers i have had for years have been struggling on with quickbooks for several years but now can't take the frustration anymore caused by this utter waste of money.
. creating full invoices away from the office! i love the fact that no matter where i am, when someone calls me with a proposal for my business, i can literally be anywhere type up an invoicequote for my business. save the information to my database which is accessible by a usernamepassword and also email it directly to my potential client. in fact, im setting 3 different invoices right now. get this app if you are in business, it's well worth it.
great app... needs some work.. there’s no way to record a sale without attaching a customer to it. also, there’s really not a place in the app to keep a ledger. if it had these 2 things, it would get 5 stars from me, but as it stands i give it 4.
very convenient, its great access. could be more useful if advanced features allowed access to edit more, like editing products
great app. awesome app
. dont bother if you dont have access to pc or laptop.basic features like editing customer email is not available on mobile devices including tablets.if an invoice isnt sent because the recipient email address sends it back,you have no way of knowing that an error has occurred even when attempting to check via any web browser.caused me £1000's of cashflow headache. contacted customer support,got a nonsensical response.made it sound like the problem is an actual feature of the app and software.
sweet & sour. been using for a month or so, very pleased on being able to do my bookkeeping on the go..... but!! disappointed on not being able to have balances on checking or savings accounts unless you get back to a computer. please add this feature.
. it's real basic. if you want to keep track of your balances, create estimates and receive payments, then it's fine.
improving. each new version a little better than the last. just like qb online for mac app, both need more features to compete with the rest of the qb product line. still has a long way to go.
. does what it says on the tin.
not enough. can’t do everything from app. they say it’s better, but it can’t be if i can’t access everything i need, makes the app pointless.
superbe app!. je suis travailleur autonome. qbook me facilite la tâche (pour ma part, la comptabilité est un fardeau) dans le fait de garder un œil sur les chiffres de mon entreprise . je la recommande hautement! seul conseil: faites vous assister dès le début afin de configurer le plan comptable ; y mettre les chiffres exacts dès le depart. vous en serez ravis!
. love this app! very user friendly and great for my small business!!
tooooo good app for business. good to make business easy
rnm media and sound. it’s a great app and system. lovely to use and easy to get around. they must just add online reception and receiving of payments. this will make business much much easier.
super simple. i love this app! so easy to take pictures and attach receipts to my transactions, send invoices, take payments, sign docs... very easy and simple...love it!
loved it. easy and very useful
. great software. helpful for my business
very helpful. quickbooks is really very helpful tool for startups. for us it has actually saved money. we could go back to our suppliers asked them invoices they have not provided. saved on wrong charges if any. also got futuristic view on our growth with balance sheet analysis. thank you quickbooks
brilliant app with loads of features!. so easy to use. so easy to learn. instant bank feeds. invite your accountant & bookkeeper & other users. so much support from intuit & the australian team. what's not to like? intuit have put together a great product for the small to medium business owner. thoroughly recommend this product.
good for at a glance. very basic facility, but better than nothing. estimates that are not accepted do not show up, frustrating if you are with your customer and trying to complete a deal.
very useful. would like to be able to send statements.
existing customers badly treated. this company refuse to permit existing customers to switch to (the less expensive) simple start package even when they meet all criteria. go elsewhere instead.
rather use my local accountant and pay the £100 per annum. rather use my local accountant and pay the £100 per annum
can’t subscribe after trial period. it’s a good quickbooks version but i started trial period made a profile and invoices but the app won’t let me renew subscription the buy now button doesn’t work when clicked on. now i may have to start another profile and lose everything?
very useful. i run a small business with this software. i haven't found anything better yet!
the invoice customization need big improvement. if you define customization mean capability to make different invoice like different logo diferent information on footer etc. i have to diferent areas of service in my company that use a diferent logos and footer information but quick book on line not work like the desktop version in this part. please fix that !!!!!
...and into the light age we come. the transition from sage to quickbooks was a giant step for mankind. functionality, interface, ease of use, report detailing and having the app on your iphone was a masterstroke. this coming from using sage for nearly two decades.
. app filho da p#@.. n sai da parte de criar conta
ios 10.01 update...... awful! not user friendly. keeps telling me to update safari to use program. still can't run checks!
. just made my life so much easier.
. good accounting sofware, horrible on intuitively usage. just try and make an estimate or invoice online with an android tablet or phone and you will experience what i am talking about, it is very lacking the ease of usage, also lacking on choices when you select services, clients, and want to make a quarry forget about it! for accounting it works but, to simple for customer management.
. been able to keep on top of my record keeping so much easier
great app!. for a business that is always on the go this is an awesome app! i love that i can work anywhere!
keeps getting better and better!. indispensable for small businesses. qb online and ipads are a big part of our ability to maintain triple digit growth year over year.
newest update issue. hi, i love this app and it normally works great. when i updated my ipad, i can no longer take payments because of a weird glitch that keeps the total amount $0 even if the item is $25. i emailed with screenshots. giving you a heads up to look for that. at the moment, i can’t process any payments. it’s frustrating! thank you.
. love the app, have used it for years. just wish by now they would add biometric log in.
quickbooks online mobile. this app is very good and getting better. soon it will be as good as desktop version. thanks quickbooks team.
terrible product and now doesn't even connect. previous reviews are on the money, this app is terribly crippled on ipad and mobile. to make it worse some days, like today i can't even connect to do these limited tasks. intuit please wake up before you get rolled over like blackberry!!!
highly functional for an app. unlike other folks i find that i can get the majority of what i need to accomplish for daytoday business done on this app. very user friendly.
invoicing on the go!. the app is a great companion to the online version. allows me to invoice and keep track of billable items on the go. there is so much more it does but for me invoicing right after the job is done gives me freedom to do my office work while having a coffee.
good app. app does what it says it will do!
great for small startup. just started using the app as the business grows it has been easy to track travel expenses and everything else we need to keep growing.
fantastic app. as a contractor to be in the field instantly give my customers and estimate or full fullblown bid and be able to follow up with change orders and billing all in one spot. very convenient easy to use and it works great on my phone , home computer, or ipad all at the same time. highly recommend this product not had one problem with it to date.
. this company is a joke they will not allow hempbased transactions it is preventing my freedom of doing business the fed has mandated banks take money on hemp transactions
very unstable!. downloaded the new version but the app consistently crashes just after login. real shoddy development and testing by intuit.
. this app is extremely slow, to the point of being unusable. the bank feed is ridiculously slow, anf accepting transactions lags terribly.
very misleading. you can download the app for free and use it for free... for the thirty days 😡 then you have to pay 11.49 a month? 🤬 that
small business owner. absolutely awful. i was forced to switch to online because of a fatal error of the desktop version on mac seirra. there are so many bugs and things that aren't available on online that were on the desktop. i literally call support for 2hrs a day.
unable to login via iphoneipad. every time i try and login from my iphone or ipad it tells me no account associated with the given information. but when i login via a web browser with the exact same information i have no problem. basically defeating the purpose of the app. fix asap please
incredible. this is an incredible application. if you're looking to intuitively streamline your business this is definitely the app for you!
easy. i have found this app very easy to use. being able to tap into your invoicing system when out on a job. it enables me to issue an invoice same moment the job is finished and emailed to my customer stood in front of me, that way my customer has a paperless invoice and can pay you right away. saves time!
terrible app. this app is not even close to what you expect it does not do what your quick books does. there is no way to change product descriptions without having to rewrite the whole item. it does not link to quick books in trial mode and not sure if i want to pay for this service. bottom line this is not what you would expect i think they are still working the bugs out buy some other app.
would be great if…. this app would really be a great app if it woukd have all the functions as on the pc. for exsample i wanted to issue an invoice with a different currency, and the app blocked it and sent me to the pc. so for what is this app good if we have to go to the pc for almost each transaction?
great app. great integration. very easy
. i only use this for invoices & bids, i love that i can use on my tablet, phone and computer, and it actually works. there was an issue logging back in on my tablet for awhile, but looks like they finally fixed it, because i have not had any problems for 46 weeks now
". this app is trash, has me very upset won't let me add a bank account just keeps saying ""hmm connection error"". this is bs i just signed up for this service and won't let me connect your app sucks and most likely will seek a refund. have tried wifi, mobile, what the funk, not quick in my opinion..."
. love this app. life has gotten so much more organized and business transactions so much easier
. this app no longer works. i cannot make invoices, sales receipts, etc. i called quickbooks and they said there is nothing they could do. i have a mobile business and relied on this app, now it's useless.
. really works great. loads fast and easy to navigate. if you have quickbooks on your 1 desktop at home or office, you are in the stone age.
not useful at all. this app was written by someone who does not understand quickbooks and its purpose. get back to basics please if this is to be used by us.
love qb online. i love everything about it. my favorite features are the qb app and being able to process bids and invoices from my phone! and being able to accept online payments thru the invoicing feature is awesome too.
. expenses do not load
. you can't edit invoice style, and the web version isn't any better. i constantly have to switch between app, website and desktop. the settings and controls aren't easily accessible.
all of my clients love it!. the ease of use is fantastic. i love that i can quickly load multiple accounts. the qbo app makes my job so much easier because my clients love tracking expenses and sending invoices on the go!
excellent app. couldnt ask for more! all my paperwork centralised in my pocket!
. i found it absolutely amazing, my team are starting to use it and they love it. reduced our time to monitor our income by a whopping 75%! we have also downloaded it into our tablets, iphones and can view and monitor and action it online and on the go, glad i bought the app!
quickbooks is genius. i don't normally write reviews for apps. but quickbooks online is simply amazing. i've been using it for over a year and i absolutely love it. i can download transactions from the bank so no boring data entry and can create invoices on the go on my phone. so good.
reports needed. need simple reports such as sales tally for a given day. unnecessary steps required for multiple entries, should use 'save and next.'
. words cannot express how unfriendly this platform and interface is. both on app and desktop. nothing is plain and simple, switching back to invoice2go as i've been trying to create an estimate for over 6 hrs here and it takes me 5 mins on invoice2go
if you enjoy torture.... nothing ever just functions smoothly. i attribute half of my gray hairs and 15 points on my blood pressure to this program that almost works. oh, wait, there’s new information, save and lose your work.... again!
app can’t find our data. we are days into this app not being able to access our data: accounting, banking, billing. access is only available through certain browsers on a laptopdesktop. the support team is friendly and wished me luck.
. excellent very useful app for business purpose.
. this app works amazing for my cleaning business! couldnt live without it, and it saves me a lot of money instead of paying an accountant
great app. this app has helped me out tremendously. i have a bad habit of loosing paperwork in this cut that out 100%
. seamless
. it's very useful
. bad tech support app has tons of errors had it for a year and a half and hate it !!
so helpful. my business is basically my husband and me. when we are both out of the office, it's been difficult to have to wait to help customers. this app has allowed me to to create an invoice from an estimate, accept payment and send a receipt all from the truck!
. great app, can do pretty much everything i need to right from my phone, but is also a seamless transition to my computer.
it's great!. love how i can operate on the go with this app. quick and easy
very useful!. great functionality!
doesn't work properly!!!!!. doesn't work properly!!!!! you should fix all bugs before u sell your service, especially then it's about money and business, stay away if u want save you time!!!
ok app. easy to setup. big difference between windows version and ipad version. like the amount of critical info showed. on the windows version all critical info is shown. on the iso device not enough info shown. like cash sale,
ok. good app but there're better ones
great app. love that i can get estimates approved right on my phone!
. does not open on my phone. crashed
great app.. not as good as desktop. its amazing app and each update is awesome. but it's not as near the desktop in terms of functionality. overall, if you use quickbooks then its a must have..
truck driver. love this app. i'm able to do all my invoicing from my phone and don't need no printer
please add a vital function. need to add bills but can't. how ridiculous to not have this function. adding bank deposits etc. surely it's time to add this to the app. for me it's unusable
no refund and help support was clueless.. called twice no one could help me and both phone numbers proved useless. billing support was not helpful. could not even locate my ipad online subscription thru itunes. waste of time and money in my experience.
easy business.. makes business income and expenses easy to track and manage payments.
. generally a good piece of software... but, if you happen to get an unusual glitch don't expect much help. two of our invoices have been resent to a client 3040 times per day for the last four months. my customer is upset and my bookkeeper has wasted days of time on hold or explaining the exact same situation to countless tech support. come on @intuitbrad is this the best your team can do?
. says an update is available and exits, while an update doesn't exist. given how overpriced qbo is, would be nice if the android app worked...and was half as nice as the ios equivalent.
. no services rendered, yet charged for full service payroll. no refund offered or given.
limited, buggy, slow... this a majorly limited version of quickbooks online. you really can't do much with it. it also crashes often and is extremely, painstakingly slow. but so is qb online for that matter.
. we tried the free trial before purchasing.. quick books keeps changing my partially paid invoice to paid in full .. when i called tech support he told me to fix this problem its 129.00he was rude and started to raise his voice after i started hows it possible i have to pay that much for a free trial app when they are the ones causing the problem... quick books is no good.. and their tech support is the rudest customer service i've ever heard!
nightmare update. it was bad before the update. how could it be even worse now? unending refreshing bank data (constant spinning wheel) makes it virtually useless and beyond frustrating for reviewing and matching transactions on the iphone.
. terrible experience. app would regularly crash, bank accounts would continuously disconnect for no reason. frustrating and in no way time saving in the end.
excellent program. i am so impressed with this new app, it is very easy to use and very helpful for my construction business. i don't even have to go to the office to make an invoice i can do it right in my truck on my phone and send it. i can check on expenses... it's a breeze and worth the time to get to know this app and online program.
very easy to use. works great but doesn't email invoices or estimates
number monkey. i love pitching the receipt after i enter my expenses!
. good summary of your business right at your finger tips. like the ability to take pictures of your receipts and enter the expense on the spot, no need to worry about keeping receipts.
👍. excellent app!
using for almost 30 yrs and about to quit. very sad that they charge for every issue now, to pay a bill, to use an invoice, even to do a credit for a vendor. it's going to be less expensive to hire a book keeper!
. being mainly a cis contractor it won't let me make invoices in app so have to use browser which doesn't work so have to wait till i get home to invoice from laptop. any chance of this being resolved. please note i have tried multiple phones and it is near impossible on mobile browser. trying to keep keyboard up is a nightmare.
. very useful app
helpful app 😊. so far very satisfied with this app. able to record expenses and deposits on the go and quickly. less time spent doing tedious book work. two thumbs up! 👍🏻👍🏻
virtually unusable. so much important elements that are not here  bills payment stub or remittance advise doesnt even have a reference or a check #, transaction history etc.
. improve ur app i clear all my data buy in app its still coming
linking bank to quickbooks. still trying to link usaa with quickbooks. i think it's on the bank's end. until we get this issue resolved it's four stars.
save so much time. love this app. now i can review customer history in the field, and even get some of my bookkeeping done wherever i am. its fast, has options i need, and fits in my pocket.
great, not perfect.... if you're looking for snapshots of where your company finances are, this app is great. it works well for giving me good information on the go. however, it seems like real, intensive work is best saved for the online version. i really like it but understand the limitations. worth a try, certainly.
. good app, has some minor flaws but does work in a pinch when your out on the road and need to do a quick invoice
not enough!. this app does not have the functionality that qbo has. therefore, useless. if we can't use the ipads in the store, what use is the app? 1. can't enter an invoice with the details 2. can't enter a vendor bill and do splits. 3. can't put payments in undeposited funds. 4. yep, useless.
quickbooks mobile app crashes continuously, unusable. the quickbooks mobile app crashes continuously and is totally unusable in it’s current condition on ipad. frustrating and we are planning to switch accounting app companies, after years with quickbooks program. intuit seems unconcerned with fixing the problem that has been plaguing our recordkeeping for weeks now.
. no support for india, go to hell!!
fantastic for when you’re on the move. this app has really helped me operate more efficiently from a mobile office. the ability to quickly and easily produce quotes and invoices from my ipad has been extremely useful. the app isn’t as fully featured as its desktop counterpart but it does enough to suit my needs, whilst i’m on the move. i’m running this app on a 10.5 ipad pro and it has been flawless.
". creo está app buena administración de empresas x ese motivo desidi "" instalarla y google como responsable de negocios, se entienda, bien con esta empresa y tiene juegos de lotería de los casinos, también, para yo jugar en ratitos,"
great for attaching receipts, not for entering expenses. i love being able to take photos of invoices and receipts and directly attach them to the expense. however, i am unable to add expenses because the app does not have access to my accounts or categories. if there was even a save as a draft option, i would give this a 55. however, i am not able to save any input if i can’t add the account or categories.
lacking compared to ios version. the layout and functionality compared to the ipad version is horrible and hard to use. plus there is no way for the customer to sign for invoice or estimate on tablet or phone. i am an android fan all the way, but i am going to have to purchase an ipad to get the functionality i need. i am very disappointed.
. quick books online has allowed us to generate invoices on the spot contributing to much quicker payments than we have been used to
. works good but only when it works. i've gotten disconnected twice now for no reason my mileage tracker first and now my bank accounts. tried to sign in on an alternate device and was asked to resubscribe. took my moneyback had no trouble doing that. but does nothing to alert me that it's no longer tracking my transactions.
. i have contacted customer service several times for support issues with the appquickbooks online not syncing the transactions automatically. no one seems to have an answer on what's going on. each time i'm advised by a customer service represenative to remove and reconnect the bank account yet in doing so it still doesn't work.
. great app & software. very helpful. would be nice to be able to keyword search within all estimatesinvoices.
great app. i don't understand what some people are complaining about it. this app works great. thank you
you need to purchase one per company. if you own multiple companies this software may not work for you. unless you rather pay double and in my case triple for each software per company. highly disappointed and no one that would solve it. regretfully invested.
new version. the updates are great.
. the new update just doesnt detect internet connection and hence cant login.
can’t record invoice payments. i upgraded my phone from an iphone 8 plus to an xr running ios 13. i installed the quickbooks app from the apple store. when i try to record invoice payments, i get the following error: qbm.error.00001160.reason.iphone i have not found any articles about this error online.
. very easy to use. i love that i can create and email invoices to my customers!
easy to use. keeps me on top of my expenses every day. should have started using it months ago!
labour cost per customer?. i run a construction company. my business in the cloud is perfect! however job cost tracking per customer still does not include labour cost in its report. i still have to do this manually. all the payroll info is in sync with the t sheets program so i don't understand why we can't get a profit and loss statement to include the labour tagged to that jobcustomer.
where’s my po’s.... vendor access is very limited.. need to be able to access full vendor info and functions. app falls short on the vendor side.
. it's a great program, not the most user friendly app ever but still a great appprogram.... the fees are high as well but depends on your situation if it's worth it to you or not...
. won't update....
. very user friendly
not quite what i'm looking for. after the invoice2go update disaster, i read a lot of good things about this app. sadly it fell short of expectation as i was unable to change the invoice number, which i would think was a pretty basic requirement. advice on the internet seems to relate to an older version of the app as the information did not relate to what was on the screen. i won't be utilising my free trial, nor will i be subscribing.
i really like it.. works great. easy to use. a business must have! (1) suggestion is being able to lock in and automatically applying sales tax to invoices. now we have to apply it manually for each item.
. nearly worthless... it isn't userfriendly, most times doesn't work, and can't easily search for items.
why use the app when you it lacks the features of the website. you can’t change the status of in invoice on the app and must be done online only. this is a major flaw in the app. once i do my taxes i will no longer be using quick books, because of the enforced complexity the system is rendered mostly useless. the app needs to have complete functionality of the site.
. nice and easy accounting software but the prices is high
horrible. had to get because of credit card swiper. ever since installed takes dozen times to save anything and same with login. anything to do with saving glitches constantly.
awesome service & tool. worth spending time and effort to set it up once. makes accounting really simple and reports provide valuable insights.
. app never up to date with website or it does not show you everything you can see online. sometimes you can't even see anyone's invoices or estimates. always an issue.
. i have tried to log on from my tablet and constantly getting an error message not letting me log in even after clearing the cache. also was meant to have a discount at sign up for a few months but charged full price.
great app. i love working with quickbooks i can take it with me anywhere i go and makes everything with my business that much easier. i have used other apps that were good but they didn't tie everything together like quickbooks. i highly recommend it.
. fast and simple to use.
. nyc app
. it's a great app. i use it all the time with my company. very efficient, and easy to navigate. automatically logs out so no one else can get access to it ( logs out after being in active for a certain amount of time). making banking, estimate invoice, and employees records very easy to keep track of. also love that i can store customers an accept payment online also. only downside sometimes it can be slow but other than that it's outstanding
good app and great support. easy to use although experienced problem with vat rate not being editable in online desktop version. intuit' response was really quick and efficient and friendly. highly recommend.
". does not sync to account. on the home screen it shows i have invoices that are overdue from customers, but when you click on it, it says ""congratulations, no overdue invoices."" useless app"
horrible customer service. horrible customer service
fair app version, but not good as browser version. i’m not able to select item groups when creating an invoice. also im not able to enter sku when creating an item. neither im able to search items by sku info... they dont let you set a fixed price for an item group on any version of the software which o find really easy to implement by code which is dumb...
so much effort!!. downloaded this to try and make my life easier but setting it up is so much hassle!! can't add my bank account for some reason though i believe i'm typing the right details in  zero replies to my emails for help and whenever i've called for help i end up speaking to someone who obviously has no clue about the app for 30 mins  why is it so difficult?! don't bother.
great app. this app is a life saver. they have done a great job with it. i have tried all kinds of other apps and this is by far the easiest to use!
. such an amazing app for storing all your business expenses.it's very convenient and easy to use.those who have difficulty in managing their business transactions should definitely go for this app.
keeps crashing. for the most part, the apps work pretty well. however, for whatever reason the app on my iphone crashes every time i login the first time. it gives me an error saying critical error please sign out. most the time when i sign back it, it’s ok after that. but usually requires restarting the app.
monthly fee. didn't realize that there was a $13month fee after the 30 day trial if i'm not already using it.
it takes some getting used to. you need to link your accounts. once you have done that, you have to remember all your accounting practices. posting entries is simple once you have done the required steps. few more weeks and i will be caught up for the year. i like it!!
. it's not perfect yet, but does what i need invoices and sales receipts in the field that i can print with my mobile printer. the recording part isn't as good as my desktop version but i know with time it will be improved.
. lacking critical features. you have to manually track down and cut and paste the customers email address when sending a reminder for an overdue invoice. to top that off, there is no audit log. there is absolutely no way to see when an invoice was sent, reminders sent, who it was sent to, etc. this app is worthless to small business owners who work on the go.
. much better than another accounting app that also ends in 'books'. works fine for me
. good this is a pretty good program. it would be better if you could create purchase orders and make deposits.
. very happy with this program an app hats off to u for such an awesome buisness solution
so easy to use. quickbooks is simple to understand and has everything a business needs with easy access from any device. i love how simple it is to use and also can rest knowing there is help on the phone 'talking to someone in australia' if and when it's needed. it covers everything a business needs to run successfully. i wouldn't use anything else for my small business
. hard to use. i bought it because of taking pictures of my receipts and i've yet to get that done. plus the app doesnt work on my phone. have to log in each time. if i had it to do over again i would not waste my money.
. the app needs to specify that it is for the online version only. in starting that it works with all intuit products, i expect just that, all versions of quickbooks.
hot garbage. latest update to this piece of garbage app requires you to log in every single time. pathetic these guys can’t get it right. update 020219; still has constant logout problems after all these years. would give 0 stars if i could.
. easy and quick to use for estimates, invoices , receipts and keep track of expenses and income
. doesn't have my back in its list, so it's useless. i've cancelled my subscription. when i contacted support, they were obsessed with my subscription, rather than the actual issue.
does not work with ios13. does not work with ios 13
slow to respond from time to time .. the app is sometimes slow to respond.
love this app!.
does not work. app does not work. wish it did, but it does not. none of my vendor activity shows up, profit and loss does not scroll past first page. better no app at all than one that does not work.
app is useless. receipts and notes entered in the app do not show in the register online without additional steps. it doesn’t even show there is an attachment even though i selected show attachments in settings. so what’s the point. absolutely ridiculous in this day and age.
crashes on opening. restating tablet did not help. uninstallinv and reinstalling did not help. disappointed. update... per instructions, emailed the person listed below. no reply. not the way to act if you want me to increase my rating.
good and convenient. i can sync quickbooks on my computer, ipad and iphone. convenient
great app. one of the best app on my ipad. great for auto repair invoicing. +++++
. good app, making it easier for me to work on the road.
app crashes. this app crashes or cannot save my data on every entry i make. horrible app!!
quickbooks online not working. i paid my subscription thru itunes, got charged but haven’t been able to use it.... it keep giving me a message to subscribe which i already did. contacted apple, itunes, and intuit quickbooks and haven gotten anywhere... frustrating!!!
great tool. very useful, and easy to access or use on the road.
so helpful. i am a small biz so this really gives me the flexibility i need to do accounting on my phone. it's really helpful. quickbooks itself is a great software and the app really shows its quality. many thanks ~j
quickbooks. quickbooks has been absolutely amazing overall. main issue is customer service and their ability to provide customer support for the app. i was required to ph 3 different numbers, one being out of service. once i finally spoke to csr he was extremely friendly but did state they haven’t been provided proper training to assist with app related issues but would do his best to help. i would upgrade to 4 or 5 stars if they provide a user friendly option for support.
. this app doesn't allow me to sign in, so it's been useless.
awful. never updates correctly. cannot find my existing customers. just cumbersome. not enough options for menus.. see above frustrations
needs to fix bugs. i love quickbooks online and the desktop version but their mobile app needs to fix their bugs. i told quickbooks support two months ago that i couldn't email an invoice from the app and they couldn't help me fix the problem then. i still cannot send invoices from my mobile app so it is basically useless to me.
needs a way to attach pdf files, not just pictures. i'd consider this a great app if i could use it to record expense receipts from online purchases (pdf files) , not just printed receipts. i keep having to go back to my computer to record digital receipts. i think it's obvious that folks these days are buying things from amazon and other merchants who provide digital receipts.
. nice but needs more. as a bookkeeper, i love quickbooks online because you can access it from anywhere. i like this app but wish i could deposit my payments and see my register. i'm so busy that it would be nice to do my personal business on the go instead of from my computer. i hope that these features will be available soon otherwise i will have to cancel after my 30 day free trial.
. best software for any business!
doesn't work. app doesn't sync all data with quickbooks online. i see only my company name and customer list. no invoices, expenses etc. intuit support we're not able to help.
. app never opens complete bull
. is this app available for india customer?
contractor couldn't live without it. i use this app every time i bill a client and can provide him with an accurate, complete invoice and receive payment on the spot. importing customers from my contacts is a great help. a musthave complement to quickbooks online.
. this app has been great for be and my small business it helps me to be able to stay on track of my invoices in and out at the touch of my screen.
. installed on android yesterday. cannot see anything on dashboard. called customer service and they don't know anything about the issue and can't help. she said she can see it on her iphone. account can be seen on desktop version but the mobile app is useless.
problem in showing reports. first of all i would like to say that it is a very good accounts managment software online but there are some problems which is faced by me as compare to the tally software like showing reports and many more and i have complained for that to customer care representative thanks regards muhmmad faisal hussain outflank trading pvt. ltd. 9999926273
app. best app
more options. app is good for basics but it would be helpful if statements could be printed from the app.
excellent online app. if you don't need all the features of the desktop version, this app is great. if you need to access your accounting remotely, then it is just the ticket. it will continue to get more features as time goes by which will only make it better.
not working on ios 13 :(. it crashes right after opening. i tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but have had no luck...
. account function is good . but technical support & help customer service is poor, not responding. wrost app
easy to use, powerful, brilliant. managing everything on the run is important... with quickbooks i can do pretty much everything i need from my mobile saving me valuable time! only thing i would request is an apple watch app.
useless. useless for monitoring company. need access to pl and other data
. dreadful experience so far. bought qb 16th dec 2019 and cant get a call back from an english speaker to help me with set up despite multiple attempts! why is sales uk based but support isnt? this is 2nd review  1st disappeared!!! so disappointed and very desperate to get started. i can login to qb online but says im in usa not uk. i have emailed you twice now. still no reply.
great app!¡. im always on the go and this app is great when invoiceestimate has to be sent immediately or when there is no computer access¡¡ highly recommended for biz on the go!!
bad update. i was having trouble with the mileage tracker and now with the update i can’t even check the settings. please fix this. i am paying for this service to help run my business. this isn’t a free game app.
useless for mobile access. doesn't have any of the features you would expect from a mobile app. if you want to do anything other than create a invoice or view transactions you put in from your desktop, its a waste of time. no balances, no accounts, nothing useful at all.
business on the run. quickbooks online with the ios app make operating a travel based business on the run simple. log invoices as you go. input estimates along the way. print and mail or email all at once at the end of the day. not to mention the helpful reports and expense management. i couldn't run my business without it.
. the service online is terrific. the app errors anytime i try to update from my smartphone for over a month now. support is unresponsive via email.
. ok app. automatic data refresh would be great
easy and quick. love being able to enter transactions on the go via mobile, and then run reports and do analysis on the laptop back home
great app!. just need the ability to take a photo of a receipt and upload it and then it'll be 5 stars (i understand this is something that the online application is lacking as well)
excellent app. i like the qb app better than the online version of qb. the app is easier to use and allows me to operate my business with no paperwork and less time spent doing bookkeeping and office work.
unable to download. it keep saying you already own this app so it will download, but nothing happens
no longer works with ios 13. i just updated to ios 13. the app now crashes immediately after it tries to launch my company. i tried reinstalling it but no luck. please fix this asap!
. excellent app makes having a small business so simple
work in progress, work not yet completed. very convenient and functional tomorrow to add expenses and receipts on the go. however only expenses not bills or other random transactions can be accessed through the mobile app. hoping intuit sees the feedback and that all transactions available including bills to be accessed on the mobile app. please add bills to the mobile apps.
. i can not believe that this app is this bad. i can only see customers invoices that i have been to in last 2 months. i use to be able to see 10 years worth of invoices. please fix asap. unless you can carry a laptop at all times which is not practical this again is useless. hello quickbooks how about a fix?
amazing app. wouldn’t be able to run my business without quickbooks. thank you for the prompt ios 13 update!
qb online. very very good in all aspects of accounting. from home office or mobile app. you can do it all!
. sucks keeps saying i have update available but then everytime i try to download the upgrade i get error code 927 saying unable to complete download. with current app it doesn't allow me to look up past invoices. the things i use most are not on mobile app. all i do with it is print current invoices with my wireless eprinter and find customer contact numbers to call them. needs upgrading with more features.
"buggy, rough, glitchy. frequently disconnectswon't sync to my companies data. frequently ""has trouble emailing this form"" when i try to send clients invoices. frequently is unable to save invoices. using 4g lte network and wifi with same results. says i'm offline when connected to wifi and network. only way to solve problems is seemingly to uninstall and reinstall app. update: now app frequently won't create pdf's that i can then print out. absolutely horrible for mobile business convenience."
not working. i have been using for years on my pc and ipad. now all of a sudden the mobile app is not working on my ipad. not recognizing my email. spoke to tech support....supposed to be fixed but it’s not.
"cool expenses feature allows upload of receipt  needs croppdf tool. one of the best parts of the app is the ""expenses"" feature, which allows you to enter all of the details of an expense on the go, including the expense account, how you paid (credit card, etc), and any memodescription of the transaction. i'd like to see the image upload function in expense allow for cropping, and even better, auto pdf conversion with cropping, like the camscanner app"
awesome!!!. fantastic and love how much this program does for you. very simple to use.
highest return on investment expense i declared as an llc. i honestly believe that quickbooks has help me get to where i am today! i am proactive and proud!
. app stops working constantly. mixes up info on invoice and has even added up invoice totals wrong. update getting worse and nothing is being done to fix. have asked for help and get none. i have invoices that have disappeared off the app!? to quick books stop the b.s. and supoort your app.
. customer service is absolutely horrible. signed up yesterday online. found out customizing invoices function has been broken for 3 months. call this morning to cancel subscription and get a refund. they're answer basically was we've got your money we're not going to refund it. you have been warned stay away from quickbooks
not able to enter bills. i cannot on this app nor the mobile site enter bills or purchase orders!! its very bad because now payments cannot be entered from my asus padlaptop please update this asap!!!!!
owner. i actually have never written a review for an app, and i've had an every iphone since the 3gs, i read the first review for this app and was so disgusted at the panning i just had to write one in support. i have a small business and use this every day! it's great, well designed and very user friendly. i run a carpet cleaning company and run basically every part of my business with this app.
nice app. nice app, quick and easy. smart invoices and bank matches. i don't like paypal, so wouldn't use that payment option.
changed the way we do business. i love this app. we needed something that we could easily use in the field. we can create estimates, invoices, receive payments and even attach check images to those payments. our productivity has skyrocketed. quickbooks has figured out the mobile accounting software. customers for life.
owner. love the program i am having problems inputing my desktop customers and previous business information. called the help desk and still waiting forba fix
. i have had this app on my phone for years. i tried opening it and i was told to update the app. so i did. now it will not open. it just keeps telling me to update. i have uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it still does not work. my business is important and this makes me very mad
. the customer service for quickbooks is ridiculous their merchant services handles your incoming payments and places holds on them with no notification until after banking day has closed and until after their business has closed. unless you are a multimilliondollar business i do not recommend using quickbooks for anything this was the biggest waste of money i have ever spent and is almost cost me to close my business.i would give you negative stars if i could you are the absolute worst platform .
best app for invoicing. hands down the best invoicing app i have found, it was recommended by another business owner and i am very pleased with the purchase.
quickbooks. a simple yet versatile tool for business.
. app never up to date with website or it does not show you everything you can see online. sometimes you can't even see anyone's invoices or estimates. always an issue.
not easy to use. simple tasks like entering a transaction are complex. app and online qb have a slow response when tapping things. just overall frustrating trying to switch from desktop qb to the app and online qb.
major flaw  can't run payrol. 3 stars as you are unable to run payrol on the go which is a major part of this app that is missing.
. its a big help sending invoices
it just keeps getting better. i love that this app continues to change for the good of the clients
great. awsome when on the road, good functions available. overall solid app. definitely comes in handy
easy. i'm still on the trial but it helps me move from paper to electronic pretty easily. feels even better that it is all in arms reach.
great app. love the app. been using for years and have never had an issue
. recently broken. was using this daily on my samsung tablet but as of a couple days ago it stopped working on all my mobile devices. i've sent feedback within the app but still broken. it's frustrating as a paid subscriber to qb.
great app. what a great app and ease of access across all platforms.
taking our business to a new level. we have been so happy since we switched to quickbooks online plus! it has allowed us to streamline our invoicing and bookkeeping. our clients love how easy it is to pay invoices online. we love knowing we've received payment for each cleaning performed! qb customer service is excellent.
should of bought it ages ago. such an easy to use app and system, back up support were quick precise and friendly. well done quick books
waiting for updates. quite frankly, it's been totally useless. the app does not sync new data entries with the online database. i've already spent well over three hours with multiple customer support reps. the idea of creating invoices is great....only problem....it does not work!!!
logo input. is there an advanced function to insert company logo in the paid version . if yes i will consider subscribing
. i think this app is not a bad idea. just that it doesn't have where i could upload my logo. buh all same it's a very cool app
. this is an awesome app. make my life so much easier!! it easy to use for my home business.
. i do everything from my phone or tablet. this makes things so much easier
good, getting better. not all of the functionality that i want but features are being added. very useful for seeing what's happening.
. this is a good program. however when using the app i cannot edit saved customers address for different job addresses to do invoices quicker on job sites.
disappointed. just updated to the latest version and this app is crashing all day i can’t even use it normally i need to log on 10 times to write one customer i can’t run my business normally like this please fix asap the app tells me you need to do critical updates. idiot i juts updated the app and now it crashes ever time i open it
bull. don't work. won't let u log inn. all bullshit. i'll stick to the one that works. invoice to go
. it runs my entire backoffice. very happy.
crashes. would give it 0 stars if possible. crashes immediately after opening page information is submitted. don't waste your time
great. great app for on the go use
. quick, simple, much less hassle than the old way of doing things.
excellent app.. simple to use and very affordable.
the option yo use qbo doea not work for ages. the option to use google maps for location misdirects you to install google maps even if it is already installed. this issue had been there since ages and they don't fix it. that's why rated bad. google maps is a must for me. apple maps suck but the app leaves you helpless with apple maps.
. love it! makes my accounting software much easier. no time wasting and sent direct to the customer and most times get paid straight away. fabulous!
. best experience
needs work. this app has a lot of functionality, but lacks consistancy with the web version. as it is today, i can't send an invoice from this app which looks the same as i send from the web version. if what the customer sees becomes consistant i could give more stars.
great app. love it real simple to use!!!
. quickbooks notified me of this update at 1am. not nice.
steve. as a desktop user this was a big disappointment. if you are trying to push people onto the online version it should work the same as the desktop. cost me time and money switching back to desktop version they messed up my data took me 8 hrs of manual data entry to correct.
. doesn't work for the last few months on any of my devices. called many times support and they said they are aware of the problem and they are working on it. this is insane!!! i'm paying every month to get the online version and it doesn't even let me sign in. it shouldn't take month to fix such a problem.
need a guide. new user here and i need this apps for my business... but i wanna know how to entry my daily sales..
really useless without bank register. the usefulness is really limited without having access to banking features via mobile app. dissappointed.
. amazing app.
great app for accounting on the go!. i don't know why people are disappointed in this app it's an app, not an entire accounting software. plus it's free! i love this app. i can create, manage & send invoices on the go. that's all i need to do. it has a simple interface. kudos to qb.
overall ok. if you have an issue good luck getting a hold of customer support. freezes up at least once a week and sometimes i can’t get into my invoices. for what i am paying for i expect more
great. great app really comes in handy when i'm away from my office.
crashes often. this app goes from being usable to worthless on a whim.
update. it takes a few days to update itself with my online account...
. great app, traveling business must have!!!!!! i do on the road sale, and i have all i need to get the job done, without having to go back to the office.......
great app. really like this app but switching from iphone to an android device i miss the expense option in the app. for the iphone you could input an expense on the app with the android you can not. i would like to see that added for the android app.
emailing invoices. this is an excellent app for tracking income and expenses. however, whenever i try to email invoices, it gives an error message that it is 'unable to send message'. will give five stars if this issue is worked out.
can't log in on nexus 5x. i haven't been able to log in on my nexus 5x for 23 months (maybe longer). i can get to the login screen and put in my credentials, but when i click next it errors. tried uninstalling and reinstalling. even installed a qb app update recently if i remember correctly. still can't log in. tried emailing info to support, but i still have the same problem. i can login from my computer or ipad mini just fine.
easy to use.. easy to use. also like customer options to pay after sending invoice.
. would love to know how this app works but as soon as i open it... it crashes. if you guys fix it ill adjust my review. but until then. you suck
moron developers and qa. don’t bother with this app. more time updating this weekly with version changes and bug fixes... jokers
. quickbooks makes it so easy to keep track of expenses, invoices, payments, mileage... everything really. i'm glad i chose this over the other options.
. horrible, spent 2 hours trying to cancel subscription. they don't have the cancel button. called them...45 min wait. terrible service.
. update 2020: since the last 2 updates, the app is broken now and does not work at all. can't log in, and just get a 'device appears to be offline' message.
professional.. this app helps me quickly and easily stay looking professional and on time with my invoices and government payments
. thank you for the update guys 😊 perfect accounting app for my firm
. excellant app helped taking the stress out of book keeping
. absolutely love it because i can enter transactions in my books anywhere. it's very convenient.
so amazing!!!!!. this has made my life so easy with estimates and invoicing.
finally!. this app does all that i've wanted  expenses and all. good to se qbo is working at this. love the mobile experience.
. banking is better and easier with the quickbooks app
wow! loving the switch!. it's more than i had ever expected. using square or other solutions or good old fashion checks in the mail are nothing compared to how seamless qbo has made my life. that mac app, ipad app, iphone app and even the apple watch app give me the pulse on our company that i've needed for so long. can't wait to grow into more solutions with qbo!
. does everything a small business could ask for!
a good idea but not very useful yet. there is not access to the important online reports. there is no access to fx transactions or accounts in a foreign currency. i live overseas and bill my clients in us dollars and as such have no access to client information or us dollars sales and accounts. if the app mirrored the online program it would be great but it doesnt!!
. does everything i want it to
perfect. great app and works terrifically. thanks.
excellent app. keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
. sucks. can't create invoices easily. much like quick books online it has become to complicated....after years of both i'mm switching
great app. love this app
great user interface. i like using quickbooks online because it is simple and effective. easy to use and uncluttered.
recent update. worked great until most recent update. can't create new invoices now. when you save it says it's saving but then just stops.
support. very sad that for a pay per month app does not work properly. have emailed support on numerous occasions with no response.
superb!!!. this is a great app for keeping up to date with accounts. links to my bank accounts and intelligently matches transactions and remembers previous matches and entries. certainly deserves the name quickbooks based on how quickly i can enter my bank transactions. great for multiuser access and very easy to set up. overall this is much better than i expected.
great app. can see my transactions in real time.
awesome. such a great package. it made my life so easy with the phone app that i can raise invoices and quotes on the go. it also makes your business look heaps bigger and professional by having proper invoicing that allows taking signature on quotes too. loving it.
constantly having to sign in!. i wish quickbooks could figure out how to not have the app constantly make me reenter my password.
needs better support. i thought this was a great app then it wouldn’t allow expenses to be uploaded, one of the main reasons for using this on the mobile app, support we’re worse than useless and could give no time scale as to when this would be fixed to a small business working on the go this defeated the whole point of using a mobile app, am looking for alternatives
qb. completely unusable since 6th september update. crashes all the time on latest ios please fix this.
. great app
. i am using quick books since a weak very happy with it as of now the help line is also quite good they will help me to solve my query or doubts then and there problems faced so far is there is no sms options and sometimes waiting time for my turn in the helpline
. i love it on my phone . but on my tablet it's slow and says non responsive a lot.
quickbooks. does exactly what on tin. takes fair bit to set up but boy its worth it
crashes. won't open. immediately crashes. please fix
great. app used to be useless while desktop version did what i needed. now app is highly functional and i use it constantly for my business. great, reasonably priced. i highly recommend.
". very disappointed considering i do use the online quickbooks on a daily basis. i installed the app. signed in. then came up with an error message. tried to log in again and it keeps coming up with ""signing in..."" but nothing is happening. 10 minutes later, app uninstalled!!!"
awesome app, love quickbooks. use it often to add expenses and check bank data. nice feature of receipt photo, works great
easy to use. i have been using qb for almost 3 years now and have had nothing but good things to say about the service provided. the support has been great anytime i needed it, they were johnny on the spot. i would highly recommend this to any small business that wants to take the stress out of bookkeeping.
". mobile app is full of bugs, recent ""update"" has now made it so my account is unable to sync and wont let me log in. not very useful for my mobile business. tried reinstalling the app, still no luck. *tried clearing data, same issue."
. geat app!
don’t rate before use. fantastic app. easy life. worth giving it a try.
. their cancellation process is brutal. thea button to do it myself online wasn't available, waited on hold forever for the phone number support page said to call, chat didn't answer forever then replied then immediately ended the chat because i didn't respond right away, chat after that kept delaying cancelling (i'm still not cancelled, had the time to write all this while trying to  waiting for chat to cancel)
. app doesn't load any files. great app if you like watching it think forever.
doesn’t work with ios13. just updated ios 13 app doesn’t load. even after deleting and readding.
great app overall. great improvement to the app. can pull up a lot of information on demand. still need some better viewing of bank register on the app. also need to be able to click on expenses in p&l to drill down into the detail. still a great app, but areas to improve.
. would be 5 stars if i could get my bank to integrate...pain in the butt to upload everything, every month.
sales receipts please. can you add the option to add sales receipts please? great app, thank you.
great software to work on the go. i just love how easy it is to use the software to keep on top of our receivables and payments. very easy to share data amongst our team to become more efficient. much better than using the desktop version
. non function cant gain acces to app kicks me to google play store. cant make invoices cant get paid please fix immediately
app times out occasionally during entry. app times out occasionally while i’m using it. when that happens it deletes the transaction i was working with.
app constantly glitches and it's very slow. i've had so many issues with this app. lately it has been extremely slow, it randomly shuts down for no reason in the middle of inputting a transaction and it won't load larger invoices. i'm very disappointed as i use this on a daily basis for my business.
game changer. totally transformed my business. really great software, so informative and nice community to support you. no brainer. can't believe i'm raving about accountancy software!
. love that i can send invoices from my phone!
makes life a whole lot easier. the easy way to track you business.
great app. this app makes it so easy for me to stay on top of my business. would recommend it to anyone that has a business and wants to know where it is financially.
. the app is not updating on my phone
. problems with poor follow up i had problems with this app send support email and they don't follow up
. grid great app need estimates though n e one know how to do that other than that great app very easy
really frustrating app. very frustrating app both on iphone and qbo. very glitchy and customer support is terrible. if the they didn't force you to use a subscriptionbased model, i'd use the installable version on quickbooks. i'm sure other have less problems, but it has not been a good experience for myself or my company.
. my wife has this app and it works well for her business. i got this app based on her recommendation but unfortunately it has been full of technical difficulties. several hours wasted on talking to tech support and was told the tech team might resolve issues in a week. all details of my invoices are erased and wrong dates are shown on all invoices amongst other problems. wish they could solve this faster, has been very stressful experience so far for me.
. good software, i find it a bit challenging compared to my laptop version.
sales manager. love this app very easy to use has all i need to conduct business on a dayli basis
cancel subscription. continues to bill my tmobile account even though i've cancelled subscription
very disappointed.. right now i'm looking for something that can run with my business. looking for more features less bugs and more useful.
. slow, laggy and pretty featureless
. good app. have a few things i would like to see added. i have made suggestions and am sure they will accommodate in due course. makes me more efficient. have come to rely on app and would have otto spend a lot more time on data entry and research without it.
convenient mobile dashboard. very convenient mobile dashboard allows quick status of all my invoices.
huge asset for small business. love the flexibility this app provides. i can do everything from the app that i can do from the desktop although it takes twice as long. however, as a small business owner being the accountant and the laborer it is great having the ability to pull up invoices with clients and email invoices on the go.
. i love the ability to issue invoices and check the current payment status. bring able to photo receipts and record expenses as and when they happen is a great touch too.
19.11.2 awful update. first thing i noticed was there is no search bar for customers, so i have to scroll through thousands of customers to find the one i’m looking for. secondly, i had hoped that we’d be able to view estimates and invoices in landscape mode to see them better, nope. then, when i tried to navigate back to the main customer list, there’s no back button! this version was nowhere near ready to be released.
great app. keeps everything so easy, nice interface and functionality
. i started using the app 8 months ago 4 invoices and it works great took a lot of stress out of my bookkeeping
the worst customer service ever. don’t waist your time. trust my word. update. i’m paying for 3 of the same app now and still can’t get any help.
nifty app!. i really enjoy using quickbooks mobile app. can't get to the laptop or pc? no worries. i can work as i go. love it! love the layout too!
good app. so far so good
discount. one of the best accounting software on the market. the only think that maybe can be added is the discount feature on the invoice.
brilliant app with loads of features!. so easy to use. so easy to learn. instant bank feeds. invite your accountant & bookkeeper & other users. so much support from intuit & the australian team. what's not to like? intuit have put together a great product for the small to medium business owner. thoroughly recommend this product.
pretty good 9 months in. really good, can't do pay roll or vat reports on the app but just about everything else. photo receipts for expenses and checking received payments. very useful. f
price just keeps going up!. forced to moved to a different app, found this one for £2.99 a month, which seemed fine as i won’t be using it very much. now the price has gone up to £11.99 in under a year! needs different payment options for those that don’t use it much and that % increase is insane.
needs updates. same app. works okay but very limited functionality. i figured since online version was updated they would've made changes here too. disappointed at how's long it's taking qb to add accounting functionality to this app.
". constantly unable to use app  login, keep getting ""temporarily unavailable"" !!!"
great app. overall its a great app. you can do many things from the app that you can do on the desktop version. i would like to be able to enter the worked hours on the app and also to be able register vendor invoices not only expenses.
great business tool. this program has helped me i the field like no other program i can think of.
. good app, has some minor flaws but does work in a pinch when your out on the road and need to do a quick invoice
unreliable.. great when it works right; frustrating when it doesn't. older data from desktop version seems to be corrupted in mobile version. when it becomes stable and reliable, it will be nice asset. at the moment, however, it's annoying too frequently.
qb mobile. we use it at our retail location. love the integration the mobile app gives. its a nice feeling to know i'm always on the same sheet of music no matter where i'm at. excellent !
best app. great
owner. great app
loads of bugs since updating to ios 13. broken links. can’t call up customer information. dashboard only shows banking information. invoices and estimates haven’t saved when generated on mobile device.
very good for any kind of business!. quickbooks is great app for managing the everyday finances. it's very fast to send invoices, with this app all income and expenses are simple and quick.
useless after update. quickbooks was wonderful until the most recent update rendered it useless. things won't save. transactions hang up. very frustrating.
. you have to pay and i am looking for a free app to do my stuff
. like it so far. i'll give update late if anything changes
. what an utter waste of my money for initially subscribing to it. very difficult to use. the questions are complicated when declaring expenses. don't bother using this app better keeping your own ledger!
good program. qb online is very accessible
great app. it's a one stop accounting app for me and it's made my life so much easier having it.
. won't sync, only shows some of my invoices. am i doing something wrong or ???🤔
finally becoming useful.. new banking update is great, now just get it to work. very buggy and extremely laggy. you hit an item, then do it again because nothing happens, but it switches to the next screen and you end up clicking something you didn't want to. very frustrating. fix this and 5 stars. on galaxy tab s 10.5 running lolipop 5.0.2
excellent accounting app. invoicing to my customers has become very quick and payments entry are the coolest which i found. secondly the one year 70% discount is the main which attracted me. i hope this discount continues i also go ahead with this accounting software app. the negative is that i am not able to connect to my local bank in uae for reconciliation.that's all from me. thanks for giving me opportunity to write a review.
it was barely ok to start with!. i had used quickbooks for several years and then went to the online version. i liked the features it had, but really didn’t like the 600.00 a year fee. for the most part it worked, but never all of the time. then when they raised the subscription price to 720.00 a year, that was it. i said good bye and found another program. no regrets!
super functional..extremely helpful. quick books app is fantastic! makes using my phone for invoicing and estimates very easy! recommend to anyone..... no glitches, no hang ups..... you won't be disappointed!
very helpful. i love this app it allows me to run my business easily
good app and great support. easy to use although experienced problem with vat rate not being editable in online desktop version. intuit' response was really quick and efficient and friendly. highly recommend.
crapapp. quickbooks program is nice though the company's blatant lack of interest in the osx platform baffles me... this app is basically worthless and does not update to changes made online four weeks ago... they have light years to go before this app is worthy of being used...
useless. this app is useless because if you have an online account with mac or pc you cannot use this app on your ipad! save your time, don't download it.
freezes all the time. it will kick me out several times in a session and it freezes up and doesn't save the work that i have done. not very user friendly for newcomers.
. cannot cancel subscription been trying for over 2 hours i will have to go to bank and change all of my account numbers because of this plus redo all of my direct deposits and all of my auto pay bills ..do not fall for this app
". i hate it. you can't do ""billable"" expenses from the app. you cant edit invoices that have been sent. terrible. i hate it."
. easy accounting! using this to help me get my small business started. the service is a little on the pricey side but having this app is fantastic!
does not work. cannot trust any invoices under clients or vendorsall are bad. only thing it can be used for is to take a photo of a receipt and add it to a vendors account. can make up an estimate in the field otherwise it is terrible
qbo is essential. i have my own consulting company and qbo makes running my business much more efficient. even an accountant client agrees. one of the best features is the expense recording. at a business lunch, i'll take a pic of the receipt, record the transaction and that's it. don't have to think about it again. i couldn't function without qbo!
great app!. it's clear they've put a lot of thought into the experience here. smooth ui and they keep adding features. thank you!
best program.. essential for any business.
can i print invoices from this app. can i print?
great app. app is great and worked well with my iphone x but just updated to iphone 11 pro mac and app will not open crashes and closes every time please fix
extremely limited, useless. inability to enter time activity which is basic functionality that’s extremely useful on mobile.
when it works it’s great. this app will not recognize my credentials even as i use the online version. i wish it were reliable and i was able to use it consistently. even reinstalling the app does not fix the problem. intuit needs to focus on making this app work on a regular basis as you pay for this service.
great app. only thing i don’t like is if you accidentally delete an invoice you can never get that invoice number back and it’s now been voided. that needs to be fixed so it can be adjusted or recovered. none the less it’s a great app. won’t ever connect my bank info none the less because that’s how you get audited for nothing.
pretty good..... i'm somewhat of a novice independent contractorpsychotherapist. i've been using quickbooks since 2014 and have been using the app for about a year. the dates of invoice reflect the date of service so this is helpful. i know for sure i do not use all features to their full capacity but it's worth the monthly investment for sure.
cannot input supplier invoices you have to upgrade. bought quickbooks for our subsidiary business, input invoices, pay suppliers etc to find out you can’t actually input supplier invoices unless you upgrade! so from £11.99 a month to £18.99 a month just to input purchase, very odd
amazing. this app is amazing work flawlessly
purchased but won’t work.. i can not contact customer service to save my life!! i purchased this after my trial but it won’t acknowledge that i have. very upset and frustrated!!!
crashes now. i got a new iphone updated it and installed quickbooks and it crashes every time i sign in.
can't create new invoice. very troublesome considering this was an app i raved to people about its efficiency yet now i can't even create a new invoice and earn money... just paid for premium too. very disappointed and would like my money back for each day the app is rendered useless.
owner. great app
won't open. this app won't open. don't waste your time.
easy to use, powerful, brilliant. managing everything on the run is important... with quickbooks i can do pretty much everything i need from my mobile saving me valuable time! only thing i would request is an apple watch app.
so far so good.. love the app. i think it's great any time i can give an estimate, invoice on the road. thanks.
. how long has this app been out and it still doesn't work? i can update my bank feeds just fine on the website and pc version but the android app always errors out. clearing cache or reinstalling won't help. i get the same error on my phone and tablet. on my other tablet it just crashes to home screen completely. why am i paying for this again??
useless. won't accept my phone number so can't go any further ill look elsewhere for a app that works
bad customer service. they are not helpful. they made a mistake to deactivated my account, after my complaint, they asked me to key in every single invoice again. this is unacceptable.
great app. great app
beautifully done. i have recently made the switch from quickbooks desktop to quickbooks online and this app gives me more than i could ever need when i am out meeting with clients!
. best app accounting for small and medium business
nice app. i really like this app, but wish it was a little easier to navigate and do more.
. we love quickbooks! it helps you to stay organized and keep track of your income and expenses so when tax season comes you have it all ready. we have found it very useful!
outstanding app!. owning a small business has enough headaches as it is. with quickbooks, estimating and invoicing projects and services couldn't be easier! everything is streamline! here's a look inside my day to day as a landscaper using quickbooks: initial client meeting> estimate delivered before i leave the property.. bam! they call back that night or the next day and we have the job. after we finish the project, turn that estimate into an invoice on site.. bam! paid! $$ in the bank!
great. i’m loving this app
. my app has stopped working on my samsung s9 for 2 days in a row. you should have sent an email to inform subscribers if your app is going to be experiencing a downtime.
. i don't seem to be able to login with google. is this supported on the mobile app (android), like it is supported on the website?
. great app!!!
. makes life easier
works and convenient. easy way to enter sales and expenses. i've had no problems with this app.
iphone x is not fully supported. thank you for stretching the app the full height of the iphone x. however, features are behind the home slab and is not taking advantage of the processing power because it feels slow. not optimized.
. useful app
doesn’t work on ios 13. so many bugs:  can’t send reminders  can’t modify invoices ( reaching invoice number limit?)  can’t send invoices( email is too long? )
great app. easy to record my receipts, but in all honesty that's all i've used it for so far.
. this makes it easy for me to issue invoices and get paid faster.
. i like the app works very well in the field. can slide cards input data all from the work site.
. makes my invoice and reconciling so much easier.
the best software. is the best accounting software , is easy to use ,
. signed on to the mobile app but it will not pull up the data for my business. keeps saying that there is a technical issue. have tried many times. no luck.
quickbooks online. efficient, easy to use, paperless. i love it! i had some help with set up from erin walsh, of quickbooksrx, and my new practice was ready to go in one day. i love the way the related apps, such as gopayment, work seamlessly together and that i can track from my phone, tablet or computer.
. very useful
broke!. worked perfect but for some reason it doesn't at at all anymore. crashes at login. i have deleted and reinstalled same issue. this is costing me time and money. really stinks.
cant connect !!!. cannot use my account , fix it please !
useful. useful for capturing my daytoday personal spendings
. excellent! this app gives me so much onthego functionality for running my business  it's perfect!
lagging after update. i just updated the app it is lagging on both my i pads.
. recently started my own business and needed to create invoices, very easy to use and helps empower the growth of my business at anytime!
. not for me and now i can't unsubscribe or delete account please delete account i don't want it and your unsubscribe tool does not work.
great app. this app is great and it supports an even greater cloudbased accounting programme, i wish i had started to use it sooner. it is making my life so much easier.
excellent. the app is a great supplement to the online version when i'm on the road. i easily make customer invoices, add expenses that i have purchased. nothing is lost or forgotten. great way to keep everything up to date
incomplete. the mobile app is not very useful compared to the online version, missing so many functions! like time sheets and billing be with them!
was enjoying it until ios13 update. this app was working fine until i updated to ios13...... boom! nothing now. crashes on opening everytime.
online user. i find this program easy to navigate then the desktop. not as cluttered as the desktop compact
very solid app.. a couple gripes, but overall great user experience.
for last month since major online update its is useless. when i login it tells me i don’t have a subscription. i call support they tell me to uninstall the app and reinstall. after reinstall the login works but you cannot switch between your companies. i called them back. they said no one else is reporting this. three users in my offivr are having the same problem. i love the iphone app for entering receipts on the go but i can’t even do that now.
truly mobile accounting apps. i have tried for a few days and it give me an impression that i can finish all my accounting without going back to desktop. it use the camera of phone wisely.
waste of space. all we want to do is access quick books online via our ipads. this app is worthless. as my business continues to grow we will obviously be looking for a software provider that listens to clients instead of putting out disappointments like this. save the space on your ipad and don't bother.
keep crashing. after last update keep crashing. new update came just an hour ago still same crash???!!!doesn’t launch the app. please fix asap pleasseeee
. pretty good overall..a free bits missing such as receive payment straight to bank account but after a few years resisting online i'm now a fan!
awesome for small business. couple problems creating invoices from phone.
great tool for those on the go!. while there is a lot of functionality missing that would make this app even more convenient, what it does offer is a tremendous help while on the go. from creating invoices to recording expenses to seeing your p&l and balance sheet, this app is a great tool and extremely easy to use!
. good app
. still new but love the invoicing but accounts payable is hard to manage from mobile phone
. very easy to navigate through
limited compared to quickbooks desktop. quickbooks online is just ok. it has some limits that did not exist in the desktop version. a lot of them have to do with assisted payroll. for example, the app does not tell you each pay period how much of a contribution to pay towards simple ira's and give you a chance to indicate whether they were paid. it just assumes it was done without giving you any notice. other limitations make it just ok.
mileage tracker, not working. i have emailed for help, chatted with online help and nothing is solved. the last response i got from the chat support was “oh.” there is something wrong with the app not my phone. i can’t even save mileage manually, i get an error that says “try back later” i am paying $40month, this needs to work.
new receipt feature not properly tested!. this new receipt photo feature is terrible. it captures about half the receipt every time! fix it, and test your changes before releasing them. a massive step back.
. awesome accounting app!
fairly useless. this app is difficult to navigate. it doesn't come close to mimicking qbo for pcs. the functionality is very limited. it's ok for looking up some things but difficult to update info such as logging checks or deposits.
doesn't work. won't open on the ipad
professional.. this app helps me quickly and easily stay looking professional and on time with my invoices and government payments
. fantastic software
ótimo!. controlo as contas de minha empresa de forma fácil e segura.
great resource. love the app capability and ease of use.
loads of bugs since updating to ios 13. broken links. can’t call up customer information. dashboard only shows banking information. invoices and estimates haven’t saved when generated on mobile device.
. unfortunately it crashes when i log in on my samsung tab a
great app but missing some key functions. i've used qb online for a year now and its a great service. the app allows me to invoice and record pymts immediately, however i cant seem to enter expenses. if i could do that it would get 5 stars.
so happy. awesome app
excellent. very sleek design yet powerful features. saves me so much time and bank feeds prevent mistakes. very happy!
. i love it invoice right on the job
easy enough to use, works best with the online version. i'm only using this for the basics of bookkeeping, so it's enough for me. the functions in the app is different than the online version, so i mainly use it to take pictures of invoices. i enter an invoice online, then snap a picture of the invoice using the app. i also use the app to quickly get a monthly total per supplier, which the online version doesn't have.
. this app has made life much easier and more organized
. very easy to use mobile accounting app
quick books app. have been using quick books app for my business for a few months now, and i am very impressed with the package, as it's great value for money. i enjoy being able to use the app on my phone as it offer all the services that i need to be able to quickly raise and send invoices and pull up important info.
. mobile invoicing, categorizing expenses, pandl, ect. powerful. get it to save money and sky rocket efficiency in business. sooo good!
much room for improvement. if it were free, it's a great product , but as a paid program and app, it could use a good deal of user input towards improvement
love it. so easy to use and fantastic customer support for those of us who are not good at this kind of thing, would highly recommend quickbooks for all small businesses, we love that being online we can have it on all our devices and have what ever we need on hand all the time, no more leaving quotes at home! invoicing on the run is great too.
makes accounting much simpler. i've been using this app for a few months and find it to be really easy and accommodating. the app when used in conjunction with my desktop program helps to alleviate a lot of ambiguity and oversight.
. great app! easy to use. well organized. perfect for small business.
. good gets better we run our company on this app
. the app keeps me up to date because i can work anywhere with my phone
intuit quickbooks. job invoices
no problems. just a decent easy tool for your business which will save on time and money. can’t complain!!
. quick books is a wonderful and helpful program. when i have questions i am assisted by technical support team.
documentcustomerjob searchinfo. i find quickbooks a great tool, however there are areas that could be improved firstly when i open a clients file i can see all the info apart from our reference, this means we need to search via pricedateinvoice number, it would be far easier to find a document by our job namereference
awesome app. i waited to rate this app because i knew eventually everything was going to be available on the mobile app. this makes my job so much easier start to finish.
. excellent does everything i need
app doesn’t recognize credentials. this app worked well for me until the most recent update. now i cant login, says can’t find the account with this emailpassword. this is very annoying since i travel frequently without a laptop. now i’ve lost the ability to access my accounts via the app.
amazing apps！. so amazing！
. works great to create sales receipts in the go and accept transactions into the register. have to do deposits on a computer. but love qbo for being able to use on all platforms.
needs help. if you have multiple locations this app is useless cause you cannot assign a class to the expense.
i'm underutilizing this app!!. this app is way more capable than the extant than i'm using it for! the best version of the app is on the ipad. the worst version is on my mbp.
what happened to this app??. the quickbooks app used to be a 5 star, user friendly, reliably functional app. since december this app has had issues with freezing, crashing, randomly logging the user out and overall has ran extremely slow. i’ve noticed this on the app for mac as well. while trying to run a business, it would be really nice to have a working invoice and bookkeeping app. please fix this
. why doesn't all my business info show up on the invoice? address, phone number... i had to add my address under business name but couldn't fit number.
time tracker missing. the online version is friendlier then the online desktop version, but all in all a great app. one thing missing is the time tracker. would be great to be able to track your time spend on a project and book it to an invoice.
absolutely terrible!!!!!. this app is garbage. funny that intuit is in their name because there is nothing intuitive about anything in this app at all. complete waste of time!!! complete garbage. just trying to set up the basic information about accounts that i use and tailor the app to my needs was excruciating. i can’t say enough about how bad this is!!!!!!
. great way to manage my business remotely. easy to use. great app!
not able to login. never download this app. i have reported this error many times to the quickbooks support team. till this date they haven't even just looked into this issue.
great app on the go. view invoices ,do invoices and bids on the go no need to wait until you get to your laptop or computer
. full details of the most important things to do with the following link from the uk and ireland and wales with company number of the most important things
. awesome program. i work in two different accounts in quickbooks. simplifies bookkeeping.
no ability to schedule an invoice. we need to be able to schedule invoice sending setting up reoccurring transactions is not a way around this. will give 5 stars if this feature is developed
. nice app
talkatone. i love this app.
not user friendly. it probably wouldn't be bad if i kept a spreadsheet handy while i was away from my computer so i could reference invioce and estimate numbers with addresses. it kind of defeats the purpose though.
great app. accounting on the go!. ahh my favorite part of the day just got a whole lot easier. this app lets you track you individual transactions on the fly. it also lets you categorize and itemize expenses. if you like neat books and your on your phone a lot this app makes things easy. it's free so just try it out.
. quickbooks has saved me so much time
. stan f. would be great if it has signature capture so that a customer can sign the invoice or receipt. the ipad version has the signature capture feature but quickbooks wants 12.99 per month just to be able to use the ipad app and other 27.00 per month for the online essentials account. thats 480.00 per year just to be able to get a signature capture feature that is only available for the ipad version. quickbooks too primitive
changed my rating to 5.. i used to upload all my account transactions from this app. now they are gone. that was the only thing i used the app for. it is now useless to me. ***update*** your suggestion worked. changed my rating.
. great customers support
everything i need. the quickbooks app has met every one of my needs for my small handyman business. i love the ability to email customers estimates, invoices, and sales receipts while i am standing there with them. i have only been using the app for a little over a month but i feel good about my decision to go with quickbooks online.
. loved it, but acting up again. when i add something to an invoice (on s8) then hit done, the refreshed invoice lines are all out of order and duplicated. uninstalled and reinstalled, still doing it. not working on tablet either. please fix asap. update: seems to be fixed now. thank you
awesome. great app and very easy to use!
. loved it, but acting up again. when i add something to an invoice (on s8) then hit done, the refreshed invoice lines are all out of order and duplicated. uninstalled and reinstalled, still doing it. not working on tablet either. please fix asap.
great app. very good app to manage quickbooks when you are away from your desk.
pretty but not functional. it's bizarre how the graphics continue to be improved but the functionality doesn't. i've been trying to use this app for years but the features i need on the go are missing such as timekeeping. mostly this app seems to work a lot like you would imagine quicken mobile to work, by being able to look up past banking transactions. but i can do that on my banking apps for free already.
. clunky, ugly app with barely any features. there's no way to refresh your banking data within the app, though navigation and ux is so awful i maybe just can't find it. no consistent design standard throughout with multiple different menu types, navigation styles, presentation. almost no graphics, just pages of text. invoicing, expenses and tracking are all so horrible i'm forced to use the (also underwhelming) browser version. how did this pass quality control?
. great app! easy to use and helps me keep track of our church income and expenses.
still no progress invoicing!. great app for running a business on the road. i wish it had progressive invoicing...
business. i'm very happy with this app help me a lot
. quickbooks accounting app is convenient an easy to navigate.
would never trade qbs. you guys are incredible, from customer service to product. i've been a customer for years and this app just tops it all off. love the ability to have as much in one. payroll, invoice, file attachment i can go on and on! keep it up!
pretty basic and useless. can't do a lot of things. it's very very basic , pretty much a basic overview of your account. you can’t do anything even as detailed as seeing the transactions in a pl report. it’s only broad overview stuff and entering new transactions. can’t even switch cash vs accrual. severely limited and cannot work in a pinch when you can’t use an actual computer.
app not working since update. normally i'd give the app 45 stars but every time i log in now it says sign in successful but there is no online account associated with the email and to start a free trial. however when i login from safari, i get in no problem. please fix as i am unable to access data from my phone.
it's a great app.. good to create invoices on the run, and keep track of your business. my only complaint is that there is no place to put in a po or job name. i would also like if customers could sign with a stylist or finger on a touch screen phone. i have a samsung note 3 and would like to see that option. but still a good app.
. it's a great accounting app. so easy to use, very encouraging to keep business books.
works perfectly for me.. very convenient to have this program online. can run my business from my phone.
touch id is pointless. needs work!. the new update was supposed to fix the touch id issue. you can log in via touch id. however if you kill the app or restart your phone, you need to log back in using your password. what is the point? i want to log in via touch id everytime. that's what it's there for.
"bad idea. i downloaded to approve parole only to find i need a second app for that. two out of three ""recognized"" transactions are inaccurate. back to my mac for qb. ugly app guys. sorry..."
waste of money. it seems like they are doing what every other company is doing. charging more for less. switched over to qb online and it has been a waste of money. no customization what so ever. looking for another program with better interface.
. i love this app.
quick books online. good for customer data base. good for invoicing and receiving payments. fair at tracking expenses. near useless as an accurate or bookkeeping tool when linked to a bank account. so many obscure and poorly explained manual actions required that error is easy to introduce and tech support usually makes things worse. one may as use good old fashioned paper ledgers and a calculator. don't trust it with your numbers!
. i love it on my phone . but on my tablet it's slow and says non responsive a lot.
. stupid 2apps at qb idot coders. so you have one app and it is great that tracks mileage and receipts but it doesn't communicate with cloud quickbooks. then you have this app that doesn't have those features. how can you dominate the market and be this foolish someone's going to come along and take their lunch money.
. awesome app for lawyers
. good experience
best way to keep track of your expenses. i love this it works very well a little hard to learn but very simple to use what you learn how to do it i use it to track all my business expenses and it works perfectly i love the touch id lot it keeps everything very secure you cannot go wrong with this i absolutely recommend it for small business owners and businesses in general
everything worked great until last update.. can't save invoices. have to login every time using password. payments don't apply to the invoices just to name a few. wish i hadn't updated.
works amazing! i love being able to attach pictures right to my expenses when i enter them. it is also really nice to be able to enter expenses on the road. it makes bookkeeping a lot easier!
app crashes. this app crashes or cannot save my data on every entry i make. horrible app!!
. useless app. not user friendly. waste of money. major disappointment
. the quickbooks app allows me to easily manage my business expenses on the go and eliminates the need to keep those annoying receipts. instead you can jt take a picture of the receipt and attach it to the expense. brilliant.
great. amazing app but whoever did that last update screw it all up. can save estimate or invoices. horrible. i hope they refund at least a month of fees because i'm loosing money having to do all my estimatesinvoices at my house instead. needs to be fixed asap.
great features. great features but would love if i could do sales receipts (and attach photo) and credit card refunds on the mobile app. everything works great and it's very nice having the option to use the mobile or the desktop.
. love my quickbooks app!
help with my subscription. it says error downloading product information
love qb online. i love everything about it. my favorite features are the qb app and being able to process bids and invoices from my phone! and being able to accept online payments thru the invoicing feature is awesome too.
error. the app is not letting me sign in! it keeps saying error!
invoicing easy. easy for invoicing etc, but less intuitive for expenses and linking accounts etc. especially as it will or allow me to sync my main business account!!!
. i already had installed an intuit app tried to sign up with my email said i already had an account my password no longer works to confusing for now to try and log in verfication codes sent
very weak. i have been a quickbooks user for years but the app is just weak. employee transactions are not possible and reports are minimal. i consider these critical aspects of good accounting software and they almost do not exist in the app. i don’t need an app to write an invoice or figure out that someone owes me money. however, keeping track of my reporting to the government and paying employees is critical and these do not exist in the app.
. great app
. very nice apps
please prioritise. can you please forget about the fancy fonts and new colours!! first repair the many bugs and crucial features missing from this app so we can operate our business efficiently. once that’s done feel free to change as many fonts as you like.
great. had some problems at first, but i was helped promptly and the problem was fixed immediately. great support team.
. awesome app
quick as a wink. very handy and does the job.
would have given 5 stars. i love the application. i would have given five stars if it allowed entering of vendor bills. it only allows expenses to be added.
quickbooks review. i'm just getting started and i'm definitely not a detail oriented person. quickbooks (so far) has made it very easy to input and the ability to link accounts makes it very simple.
horrible. crashes every time. horrible customer service. move on to another app.
. great app for small business. easy to use and saves me a ton of time doing my accounting. accounts payable and receivable couldn't be easier. i really like the free bank transfer option i can provide my customers in their invoices. taxes are quicker and easier thanever everything is in one place and no more collecting receipts. i highly recommend quickbooks to anyone running a small business.
doesn't work. app doesn't sync all data with quickbooks online. i see only my company name and customer list. no invoices, expenses etc. intuit support we're not able to help.
. error message when i try to log in on my tablet. customer service offers little assistance after a long time on hold. this experience makes accounting for my small business even more unbearable. (update 11418): i dropped the review down to one star (from 2) because the error message is yet to be resolved on my tablet, three months later, and qb has increased the cost of their simple start plan by 30%. lame.
major problems with the newest update!!!. the app was working great until a few days ago. now i cannot receive payments on my iphone due to a bug in the app and i also cannot send an invoice via email on my iphone or ipad now. ☹️
good, not great.. quickbooks online can do everything i need it to do. but i have trouble getting invoices, quotes and expenses saved to the cloud. it's annoying and aggravating to be waiting for things to upload. if the cloud sync thing worked seamlessly, then it's a 55 for sure.
. i am very pleased with this app
great, but can learn from others. just my observations: mobile app should be mostly used to record expenses. it lacks ocr tracing. moreover scanning a receipt is a multistep process. should add forcetouch to add receipt (open in camera). invoices: been searching how to add my banking information. cannot believe quickbooks does not allow for adding banking information to invoices. did i miss something? or is it a hidden feature? not very intuitive (pun intended). otherwise good. like the integration with bank account.
crashes since update. i've tried to create a twoline invoice repeatedly since the update, and it crashes every time. will update review when it works.
excelente app. intuit ha hecho un excelente trabajo de poner a la mano literalmente los libros de contabilidad de la práctica y de los clientes. totalmente funcional y fácil de usar.
great but could use a little more. overall pretty great. clean easy to do basic tasks, would love access to a few more advanced features...but overall it's a great app. the app is stable, love the fingerpint login (even though it's still a little buggy at time of writing the review), it's clean & easy to read, good navigation. overall i'm very happy with it!
works but needs work. for the most part the product works, but has many errors and sometimes says there are errors but they are never fixed, i run the lasted ios on an iphone 6 and still have many problems
. it is awesome, very intuitive, simple, more than value for money paid. can you add bills and bill payment to the mobile version?
not for the ipad or iphone. the app does not support stp... have to access using web browser on ipad iphone . so don’t buy the app if you want to use it for stp. browser access using an ipad pro , you won’t be able to scroll down or access command icons because they are beyond the margins of the ipad screen. can’t finish inputting categories because the screens won’t scroll at all
love it. great software when teamed up with abdroid app
best addition for any business on the go!. the free trial was amazing. my favorite part is having the ability to send invoices. while setting up my merchant services, customer support was kind and easy to work with. now it's easier to bill my clients from my phone. i track everything. get the quickbooks app. you won't regret it!
great app. great app. only wish that it had payroll on it.
great app. super friendly and sweet app
plenty to be desired. there are options such as making expenses billable is not available. previously had issues with adjusting tax in the app and the support team told me to use the web based version. what's the point in having an app with features when the support team just tells you use the web version.
qbooks is a entrepreneur's dream. i've been doing bussines as general contractor the last 20 yrs, always i tried to find a software where i can handle all my administrative information at all (invoicing, payroll, expenses) with this apps you can get everything at your fingers reach, so you can control all money inout. it's a world marvel!
. i like the apps easy access but it truly suck because nothing is accessable properly. writing an estimate or invoice on this app is not possible. not properly anyway. its really not pleasant either going online via cellphone because it zooms in and out improperly. its very frustrating. as for quickbooks via laptop i love it. quickbooks has truly made my life much easier and way more organized. but the app needs to be fixed and also online via cellphone bugs.
. very close to cancelling my subscription as app doesn't work. after adding 45 receipts i get an error message that my request cannot be added and i should call customer support. have tried reinstalling clearing cache signing out and nothing works permanently very frustrated
great app.. make it more like online functionality. but i love the expedience especially in negotiations.
. i was asked to update which i did and now it won't open
. exceptional support
. i absolutely love it so far for my small business. love being able to make invoices on the spot and email them.
not as good as desktop. needs to be able to do more with employees and checking invoices and managing the dashboard
convenient access to financial information. we recently switched over from the desktop version of qb and have found the app to be a convenient way to view financial statements. i also really like the ability to take pictures of receipts and attach them to expenses from my mobile phone.
more features like desktop version!. needs to be further refined to include functions and features like submitting statements. simple stuff that just isn’t possible on the app version.
game changer. changed the way i handle my business transactions. from a simple to complex my invoices and estimates are presentable, traceable and accounted for. my reports help me secure loans in a flash. and my accountant loves me.
this app does not function properly on ios13. i cannot view any customer files. i can search for them, but the app will not let me click on a customer to edit invoices.
very good app. in general very good app. missing key features like banking, updates etc.
cant even start the app. how to rate a app that not even running
. app crashes a lot. several times after updates are made to the app it will crash after i have to sign in again. now it just crashes after i try to sign in.
. i use quickbooks online with a scheduling program that is synced together. i am a one man company but you could never tell. thanks to quickbooks. l also have increased profits
quickbooks. great app tool.
. great on the go invoice app
. great app for any small business would recommend it to anybody who has a small business very easy and accurate
onion vs. desktop. i have just purchased the desktop version. i would.like to use the app to record my expenses on the fly. from what i can tell you need to have an online account to do so. please help if there is a way.
. till now i am satisfied with the app....
it's happening. the quickbook people are really developing this app and there complete system, from a very poor beginning the app is is really strong now and very functional, please keep up the good work quickbooks people. highly recommended book keeping system.
. i can't view estimates on this app unless i input them in manually. they will not upload. only customer information and invoices. this makes it very hard to be onpoint with my crew.
. moderate user, nice to estimate and invoice on the go
jason. great app, but the online version needs progressive invoicing, fix that and its 5 star!
fix finally now i can get back to work.. this version fixed the errors from the last update. glad it working again. quickbooks has been good except the last update. this one fixed the issue. we us this app for our onsite business and it's great. several times i would send an invoice to the customer when i'm leaving their home and before i get to the next job it's already paid. update. does not work again. :(
not happy any longer!. having issues logging in every single time now, very frustrating and not happy at all. always asking for finger print, and when typing in my password, it takes about 5 attempts before it’ll login to my company info. also having a constant lag when trying to inputsubmit any items to customers. this is extremely upsetting when trying to submit invoices before a deadline.
"was great until recently. this used to be a great app until a few weeks ago. now, every morning when we go to open the app it states ""downloading company data"" and does this for hours. we have customers needing to get estimates, pay invoices, etc., but can't because we can't use the app! this just recently started happening. qb can you please fix this issue??? this type of problem shouldn't go on for this long!"
does not work with desktop pro plus 2017. i didn't know i had to spend even more for the qb license and upgrade to the online version.
good app. it does ok in a pinch. certainly easier to search transactions on a computer.
. i would love for this app to work as it would be a great tool. would be way way better if i could enter data even when qb says (incorrectly) there is no internet, and it could sync later.
great app. since the last update everything seems great. if an option to maintain inventory is added then this app will be perfect for anyone.
great! but it could be a tad bit better. the app is great and works perfectly fine. just needs to somewhat mirror the desktop view. only use it when i have to or can't get to a computer and all the visuals from desktop view are what catch me. easy to ready everything, maneuver around and get to what i want. app is half that, but other than that, i like it
meh. constantly making me sign out. constantly not updated with what’s online. constantly telling me i’ve got outstanding invoices that have long. we. recorded online.
"love this app!. love this app but it would be great if they allow me to include ""shipping date"" for the invoices generated on mobile"
sign in error. can't even sign in anymore. tried on multiple devices so i know it's not my phone. please fix
very helpful. this ap has been great with my ipad! being able to enter receipts and attach a photo right from the camera is the best! i love having the ease of bookkeeping on a smaller device that i can take with me everywhere.
. great functionality for an app
what happened?. this app used to work perfectly. after the last update i can't use it how i used too. if they do not fix it soon i am going to have to look into other options
. simple and easy to use app. makes life easier for small business owners.
. simple to use and quick
great for on the go use!. love using this app! great for small business use & being able to use anywhere! with multiple people using one app!!
. fantastic app
great program. i love the program and still give it 5 stars nonlinear issue is i can’t run credit cards on the ipad version. wish it worked.
crash issues. this app crashes on the new iphone 11 pro max using ios 13. please release updates to resolve the issue.
love it. they fixed the errors i was having. great app now.
. very handy!
disappointing. i've been a longtime user of the desktop version of quickbooks for the past 20 years and just recently switched to quickbooks online. i was really looking forward to managing my company's expenses, print checks, and enter bills from my new ipad. i am terribly disappointed in the complete lack of features available in this app. it's actually completely useless and a waste of memory. how could intuit release such a piece of garbage such as this?
great for both business and personal use. i have both complex personal and business financials and quickbooks is the best product i have used to date to track both. there is a bit of a steep learning curve to use it, but once you learn the software it is very powerful.
. everything is simple and easy to use
does everything i need it to do. the app is easy to use and does everything i need it to do.
broken after update. not updating customer data, crashing, please fix it, i have a business to run!
awesome!. easy and simple to use!
. this app has zero functionality
online is the best way to go. making my busy life easier one click at a time
ability to get paid, in my pocket. if all the quickbooks app allowed me to do was create and send invoices on the fly, i would pay for it. it is that and a lot more.
crashes ios 9 dont download. incompatible with ios9. can't run business properly now. please fix asap.
convenient. can enter sales receipts and expenses into quick books away from the office. that's a useful add on to their online program.
unuseable. the developer disabled the ability to paste in your password. i cannot use an app that requires me to spend two minutes pecking in my 28digit password every time i want to use it! enable paste and i will give this app a try.
. this app is useless and doesn't work properly on a phone
incredibly glitchy. the app is glitchy despite updates. i’m not super impressed by intuit in general. i use their payroll for my business, a lot of glitches there too. app crashes or spontaneously exits my selections to “accept” for no reason and i have to start over. does not learn well, i have to reteach things over and over.
silly errors. there are a few silly things that would be so easy to correct. invoice design, and worst of all sending a customer a copy of a paid invoice shows invoice amount as 0.00. not the actual amount and paid.
great app. this app has been a big help. flawless!!!!
. great app. but wish they would integrate more reports on the mobile app. sometimes on the road these reports are crucial, but there is no access to them in the app.
crashes. this app fails all the time, i keep having to reinstall to log in.
constant errors. errors have gone away working flawlessly!
five stars!. has helped out tremendously when it comes to my business. it makes it so much easier to use then the paper receipt books. it helps me stay organized and keeps me updated to the second. thanks quickbooks!
. i use this for my business and can't imagine going without it. gave a 4star because i wish i had a help guide on the app for certain circumstances.
. not enough to complain! what app let's you try it for free and actually works every time. i can't wait to buy it for all the years to come and use it more than i already do
. poor. this app worked fine for 2 years and now they have recently removed the feature where it automatically adds receipts to transactions. the support morons keep telling me it never existed in the first place but i used it for 2 years! i'm now looking for another app to use in it's stead. avoid it at all costs.
not great. there are multiple problems wrong with this program. you can't bill a customer when you attach a receipt which means i constantly have to switch between devices. my expenses according to the customer are incorrect. i'd like to see my estimateinvoice minus my expenses per job. the only reason i switched to this program from freshbooks, which is way less expensive and more user friendly is because quickbooks has a balance sheet, which our accountant required.
. this app has been a life saver!
nice tool. i like this tool a lot but it could use more links. you need to add the ability to add to the time sheet service. i upgraded to use that on all my business phones on the field and low and behold support lied to me and said it was possible. so i upgraded and guess what it's not in the app.
. terrible app, customer service is a joke with no follow up. switching to a different accounting software.
"won't open. download twice. when i try to log in says i ""need to make payment or my account has been canceled"", which isn't true. i open it on my laptop just fine and have automatic payments. what gives?!!"
. you can't edit invoice style, and the web version isn't any better. i constantly have to switch between app, website and desktop. the settings and controls aren't easily accessible.
makes it easy. so glad i decided to go with quickbooks, update daily to keep track of expenses and sales. fantastic for my business.
love it. easy to use. great support team.
. great app and very simple to use. just what my construction company needed to be legit
occasional early glitches with mobile overall v good. i use the mobile version and it's access to my phone contacts makes it really good. there have been a few minor glitches with support but this is getting better and better  so apart from the few minor glitches early on then it would be getting 5⭐️ latest update after 6 months  excellent 5 ⭐️
excellent. does what it says on the tin.. excellent app. works brilliantly on the ipad, sometimes find it a little sluggish on the iphone but i put that down to the poor wifi we sometimes have and bad signal from phone operator. anyways it's so easy to use and i can produce an invoice there and then and email to the client instantly. don't know why i took so long to move from desktop to quickbooks online.
progress billing & payroll. those two items alone differentiate this on line accounting software from all the others. their tech support is always helpful. progress billing is done through projects, it’s getting better, the use ability is getting better. this also allows project costing. 
waugh and son's marketing.. great app lets me check what's on my computer and add little things when needed.
owner. there are a few problems that i find and maybe it me. the more i use it the more i like it
error add item. ne fonctionne pas, toujours un message d'erreur quand je veux entrer un item ou une description. impossible de faire une facture avec mon mobile !
ios 13. app crashes before opening! please fix asap!
great app. after a little getting used to, this app works well. we're a small construction company that works two to three jobs all over the southeast. we've used quickbooks desktop for years, but as we've grown, jobs have taken my partners and i to different regions at the same time. qb online app allows us to ensure that all bids are taken care of, and allows us to see who's doing what.
. garbage. been with qbo for 4 years. app is impossible to use now more than ever
service date is still broken. has had this problem for months and a fix has yet to be included in an update. will be not be staying with quickbooks.
doesn't work. app crashes on load and while logging in. pretty useless so far. :(
junk  plagued with issues. this is is great when it works, but is plagued with bugs. as of recently it logs me out to “refresh,” then when i log back it it tells me the account doesn’t exist. i fix this i have to delete the app and reinstall it, every, single, time. and their customer service is terrible. they never have any solutions.
great ui and mobile to desktop experience. i just started using quickbooks about two months ago and i don't know what i would do without it now. it's simple, easy to run a freelance business with. it's helped me become a freelance business and get paid which is the most important part :)
very confusing. i will try as long as my patience lasts, maybe it will crack it better
might be better. purchases within the app are very expensive! and, by the way, the app cannot be considered as stable
can't even login. useless program  i can only use web browser to access, app is not working at all
. excellent app. i've been self employed for many years but have only starting using quickbooks recently and it saves me so much time...
lacking. this app has potential, but it's lacking. especially the fact that you cannot make deposits on the mobile app, only on the desktop version.
doesn’t support enough features in app. can’t generate invoice with cis. not sure i will subscribe after trial.
. great app!
. i love the app. i would like to see full functionality. that would allow for entries and time savings everywhere.
. good app
. enjoying the ease of use. good app!
it's a good app. it would be even better if it would have the tax info. in the drop down menu, that way i could pay my taxes from my mobile device 😕
improved greatly. since the last update, the bugs have been worked out and the issues i'd seen don't occur anymore. thank you
fits my needs. easy app, portable. thank you
easy to use and keeps me updated. works great on my s4.
awful. it's so confusing i hate it can't seem to manually enter stuff have to download from hsbc but other accounts i use ie trade card & fuelgenie aren't recognised so it refuses to set up & let you enter stuff manually. i so much preferred to enter everything manually you know where you are with this i haven't a clue it's all over the place. i want old fashioned quickbooks that was easy and understandable this is a joke.
made my job way easier. been really useful for creating invoices and collecting payments for our company!
. simple and easy to use
great but not perfect. while the app works 95% of the time there are some annoying glitches. some of the menus could be better laid out and some entries should be automatic. it would also be nice, when selecting the quantity of an item, that there would be a + and  symbol for easy editing. i'm also baffled why i can't do a deposit like i can online.
. love being able to work in quickbooks from my phone! one of the best features is being able to take a picture of your receipt and attach it to your expenses right from your phone. makes your bookkeeping incredibly easy! wonderful customer service, love the payroll, too many good things to say about this app.!
. won't let me sign in from phone (s10). app is useless unless used from computer
". quickbooks is okay but the app is bad. won't ever let me log in the screen just hangs on ""hang on, we are getting your quickbooks data"" and then says that it can't connect..."
confused. unlike using my laptop to filter purchases, payments, and deposits the app is extremely confusing and when purchases are made you cannot view them live or even see previous ones, instead i have to spend a lot of time logging them in. i purchased the quickbooks online through my laptop in hopes that the app would make my accounting easier by using my phone, as i do not have time to constantly log into my laptop. the app is too time consuming and confusing.
lacking features. when receiving a payment or creating a receipt, i'd like to be able to take a photo of the check or any other attachment i want. i'd also like to be able to choose the class and what account it's going into. these are all things i can do through the web browser.
great app. deffinetly brings organazion to our bookkeeping. love the update.
very good!. great app  i love the upgrades.
. awesome app that assists me to carry out my personal finance activities
. excellent app
great job. great app! great for my graphic design business!
nexus 6p problems. still does not work on nexus 6. i'm trying to run a business this app use to make me efficient. now it sucks that i can no longer log in to upload receipts. i would give it zero if i could.
. i like it when on the desktop it's easy to use but downloaded the app on my phone and i can't even log on!
fantastic features. all the features that works under this single app. i used to work with excel spreadsheet, invoice app, expense app to complete the business on the go. now everything has being simplify into this one subscription saving me time and double entry. i am absolutely happy that i can email invoice, take pictures and enter expense using my iphone. best of all these is update into the cloud. great excellent accounting software nothing comes close after trying others accounting software.
"love this app. it is so awesome to be able to login to our accounting software and services do an invoice right from the service location we just finished up on... i can actually send a store manager a estimate sheet as a ""what was done  sign off sheet for his record in the case of a corporate billing. i am so glad i chose qb's online..."
there is no sku column. quickbooks online is great but if you are a reseller good luck sending a p.o because it doesn't have a sku column so the mfg won't know want your ordering. this is the worst thing that and you can't do sales orders.
business at a glance. for the detailed stuff, i like to stick to the desktop version, but for quickly seeing the status of invoices  profit and loss, the mobile app is great.
best move ever. glad we use the online version because it is easier when not in office to get to our information
great app. does what exactly it has to do
. still in trial, but so far so good... very pleased with overall functionality! trial over, five years later... upgraded to 5 stars. perfect app for my small business. does what i need, always available, improves the client experience.
ok.. maybe i'm just used to regular qb's but i'm having a hard time with this. and why is it i have access to more on the computer than the app? other than that is great. very helpful.
lots of steps. i like the app but there are lots of steps and it takes me a while. occasionally the transaction doesn't go through. it does update my quickbooks so i like that and it saves my bookkeeper time
. great app, i am a self employed consultant, i invoice with ach bank transfers for 0.0% free! all accounts synced. good stuff!
mobile app. convenient.
amazing. amazing app
iphone app is the worst. the iphone app doesn't work. their customer service people admitted it doesn't work. don't even try to use it  too frustrating and a big waste of time. online version and ipad versions are good but too limited for price  reports can't compare year over year
. when we process credit cards ti is showing the transaction being paid. however, it does not connect to gopay, even though we have that function turned on. we did not realize they were not processed completely until we did weekly reconciliation. as of today, this bug has not been removed. 3.8 on our other tablet is working fine.
. i share this app with a gal pal of mine and she loves using this app
. this is a very user friendly app. i can modify and create estimatesinvoices on the fly! good work intuit!
invoices. i would like to be able to sort the invoices as they come in by day.
quick books online. ease of bookkeeping entries at home or on the go  i thereby circumvent hiring to data entry
. i love it ...just wish i could personalize information fields on the invoices to accommodate the type of work we do mobile mechanics add fields for vehicle # vin # license plate and mileage would be awesome
excellent on the go apps  for small business. easy to navigate .
very helpful. i just started my free trial and this is such a great tool for me on the go.
so much better than sage. we moved from sage to this and haven’t looked back. the app is better and the links to banks work (unlike sage). the help and support is better than sage too. all in all, well worth a trial.
. i've been using quickbooks for a few years. it's been great. but lately i haven't been able to access old invoices or quotes. very inconvenient for past work that we've done. now i'm having a huge issue with latest data not syncing to my device and can't even get into my account. things should be getting better not worse. i've consulted with customer service which hasn't helped either.
engaged user who loves the product. team quickbooks, i think you have one of the better products on the market. i would really love to see payroll support on the app or available on mobile devices with your online product. i like the simplicity of your product and the user experience i think is better than others on the market. please deliver either a mobile browser supported payroll feature or even better a app solution now.....
. great app to help track expenses
. i have updated my review. quickbooks has made some great changes and improvements. they still have a few to go. but definitely on the right track. i have also had to contact customer service and they were super helpful. thank you quickbooks you have changed my mind and made this a great app. definitely recommend!!!!
do not use to run payments through. i ran two payments with them the first they held up because routing number issues and the second because my bank account was not financially available or what ever to run transactions what kind of s**t is that now they want me to refund $2100. to customer on the card after car has left 4 days later and i have to figure out how im going to get my money . horrible !!!!!!
simple. simple easy to use, love the phone app.
. great app!
great flexibility. love being able to do estimates and invoices on the go.
. good app perfect
keeps everything in one place. great app! i keep all my business and personal expenses logged and in place from my phone. i can also track multiple companies. gives me so much piece of mind and way easier for keeping track of taxes and book keeping.
. doesn't work
super & excellent apps. very user friendly application . i would recommend this software to other people
low rating until the app supports chart of accounts. the app continues to be under developed for functions that are developed in the web interface. the app is excellent for invoices and credit card transactions if you have a merchant account coupled to your qbo account. the camera can be used in app to document your receipts to the cloud and i use it extensively for hotelairfarerental car expenses and they can be attached to invoices when emailing your customers.
what happened?. this app used to work perfectly. after the last update i can't use it how i used too. if they do not fix it soon i am going to have to look into other options
great mobile app. perfect for my mobile power washing company as all my customers and estimates are available at the touch of a button no matter where i am!
tax problem in hong kong. i mostly use it to do my expenses, now with this update, they force me to input tax. but there is not tax here in hong kong. didn’t have the problem before. i don’t know how long they need to fix that. 👎🏻👎🏻
". won't allow me to update ""company information"", so customer invoices and receipts show the wrong information displayed. not a way to run a business, only track p&l. disappointing."
not many useful features...yet(?). no access to trial balance or p&l reporting. no access to cash balances. no report writing or report generating capabilities. i guess it's free, but i hope there is a robust pipeline of upcoming features.
keep crashing. after last update keep crashing i can't create and send my invoice please fix asap
okay. this app would be perfect if it didn’t redirects me to safari to login every single time
. nice app
salvage yard and towing co. we have used quickbooks for so long i remember uploading the first version into my computer with a stack of 5 12 inch floppy discs. this mobile version is the best. i'm able to see what the days totals are as well as adding sales with my iphone or ipad.
unuseable. the developer disabled the ability to paste in your password. i cannot use an app that requires me to spend two minutes pecking in my 28digit password every time i want to use it! enable paste and i will give this app a try.
worst.. i can't see my data in qb app. it isn't working. i have android 5. i can see some data in webpage version using chrome browser.
thankful. i'm so thankful for quickbooks. i'm still learning a lot about it, but i don't think i would not survive without it. i started a small business 1 yr ago. i love the app! i'm always on the go and can access it from anywhere. highly recommended by us @ the hygienist helper, llc!
ipad app. please update your app to be more like the desktop version...i can not track inventory received through the ipad app i purchased and ipad pro hoping to do away with my laptop and so far its been seamless, except for this app not being able to track inventory received. i hope your developers can figure this out before my 8 year old laptop crashes! thanks
it's great. enjoy this app
"intuit  ""design for delight"" _experience. awesome ! cheers . team foodtropis™ (disrupting food consumption , globally )"
stopped working on samsung galaxy s6. never had a problem with the app till about 3 weeks ago. it stopped working on my samsung galaxy s6 for no reason. i'm a small business that's on the road a lot and need to be able to send invoices on the spot. please fix it.
. these updates to the app and online service are worthless and have screwed up the format entirely. the latest update (91117) has caused the online version to work at a snail's pace! i'm using a brand new hp with intel 7th gen, and a terabyte!!! stop updating stuff that works fine!!!!
data sync is not working. managed to get it to work. the sync only work after you pay the subscription. doesn't work during trial period. (there is an error syncing data. error code 132. 100. unable to work with it.) another problem with this mobile app is that it is unable to change the status of the estimates.
amazing. at last i can invoice on the move and do the rest of my book keeping as i go. great app and easy to use.
. always having an error notice when signing in
app needs major work. the app is useless, i have to pull out my laptop or wait till i get to my home or office. i would love to use my ipad pro, that i carry everywhere but the app is literally useless!!! please fix asap
. app never up to date with website or it does not show you everything you can see online. sometimes you can't even see anyone's invoices or estimates. always an issue.
easy to use. its very handy for me
. cannot change estimates from pending to accepted on android version.
. very user friendly
. easy to use and one of the best support system.
. great app
. this app is now horrible, it was great up until latest update and now i am unable to run my business using this app. very frustrating when an app takes steps backwards please help????
love quickbooks. we have a small business and quickbooks is so simple and straightforward to use, it saves us so much time, and i can write and send invoices straight from my phone! love it.
. works well. can create invoice and estimates on the go.
great mobile execution. this is a great extension of qb online and includes the same userfriendly interface. it makes sending invoices on the go a breeze. love it!
another weak quickbooks mobile app. once again, with excitement i upgrade only to be letdown. when will intuit make a full function app? i love the message that tells me the function isn't't available for my device but i can access it from my pc...great, i'm still tied to my desk! why bother with the mobile app then?? i love how i can only rate this useless app once in the lifetime of having it,i would give it no stars if i could!
nice, but naughty. i am writing this review at christmas, that explains the headline :) this app used to be awesome. now i get a lot of can not connect to data or can not refresh data even after multiple refreshes. hope they fix it
slow to respond from time to time .. the app is sometimes slow to respond.
simply the best. simple and easy to understand and use. above all, the free technical support is out of this world. go for it, you cannot go wrong.
awesome app!. great software, well written and updated regularly, moves seamlessly between phone ipad and desktop
. problems with poor follow up i had problems with this app send support email and they don't follow up
problems. the app have now problems i recommend to check that i was using the app for 3 years but now is a disaster
". error message that cannot be fix ""cannot add this invoice, if error continues, please contact support"" that cannot be fix from quickbooks my android app been like this close to 1 month cannot create invoices estimates so on my business suffer cause of that, have use regular computer to create what was said. not good for business all subscriptions are active."
"issues. it was working fine on my ipad up until last week. then starting bugging. not all customer transaction appear on the mobile app. called customer service about it. they told me that they were ""working on it"". we shall see. i pay for it monthly...i asked if i still had to pay this month even though it's not working as advertised...answer was yes. not happy with that answer. i will keep you posted. bob"
fantastic. this program is fantastic! i use it to run my wife’s business and our clients loves it
best accounting app except for some glitch. it is the best accounting app that i had so far. i like the inventory part. what i don't like is that the activities for the suppliers are empty but with the web and desktop app the activities appear.
. so far so good. i like the way the mobile app compliment the online version. great tool.
. very impressed with this userfriendly app!
. love how easy this app make doing business.
amazing for small business!!!!!!. i started my service business one year ago and enrolled in quickbooks from day one. i can't rave enough about it! it's made tracking customers, invoices, and expenses so easy i can focus on my work instead of the accounting. still impressed and just in the process of adding payroll.
need to support multi account. i have 2 accounts abs it’s a pain in but to switch.
. please add 2 factor authorisation to the app instead of having to receive a text or email all the time when i log into the website.
beyond useless. i have long been frustrated by intuit's decision to bar users on ipads from accessing any real functionality in quickbooks. i thought this app might address that problem, but it does not. it does not offer anything useful to me.
few options for a businesses. quickbooks does it right but there are still many options missing. consignment sales for example. being the consignor or consignee
rubbish. on quite a few occasions including the last six or seven attempts ‘unable to get all my quickbooks data’ think i’ll be binning this app!
. has potential but hasn't let me update any transactions since day one. tells me to try back in a few hours. not the best way to run a business budget. update: it's been a week and still broken. performed all the suggestions in the response article. update 2: yeah did email them like you asked. still waiting for a reply...
fake claim. i am not sure why these companies feel like they have use false advertising to sell their products. i do get it. i understand that some companies, usually the big ones, feel like they have to recoup development costs for their apps. well just be honest then
won't connect to qb online since update.. i've been using qb for ipad with few issues to date, until the latest update. now, i'm on a job, trying to invoice a customer and can not since the app will not connect to qb online.
app keeps crashing. please fix your app... i pay a lot of money a month for your service and this app is terrible. for the most part i have to log into the online service to do any work. please fix your app
. good app works good it saves allot of time, go payment should be integrated into the app
doesn’t work with ios13. pls fix
signature doesn't work with ios 9. my signature for my invoices that i need to get paid on no longer works with ios 9. still no update!
sales tax calculation is wrong. when creating an invoice, the app does not honor customer's sales tax setting. it applies tax even on customers with tax turned off. please fix asap!!!!
feedback. the app would be better if you were able to enter bills not just expenses. very annoying to have to also use my desktop computer to finish my book work.
don't support in india. if you don't support in india why you create account in first place.
new version problems. ever since the last update, i can no longer categorize and add income and expense from the app. it seems the buttons to “add” do not work.
needs to fix bugs. i love quickbooks online and the desktop version but their mobile app needs to fix their bugs. i told quickbooks support two months ago that i couldn't email an invoice from the app and they couldn't help me fix the problem then. i still cannot send invoices from my mobile app so it is basically useless to me.
. i really like being able to do all my estimate and invoices on my mobile phone
. takes a while to get used to it. handy app
business owner must have. great app to work on the go. create, modify and email invoices. keep track of anything financial on your handheld device. fully automated office on the go for the busy self employed entrepreneur.
easy and friendly. so far i am enjoying the app and it's easy to understand platform
changed our business. from the first version of this app with the online version of quickbooks, this has changed our business. no more scribbled notes on sticky paper or back of a student roster. sales are done immediately and nothing is lost or forgotten. my only request is to please add time tracking fit our instructors into the app, then it would be perfect!
fantastic. i love this app! it's very useful
new update crashes every time. new update makes me close and reopen every time for critical app updates
. perfect for anyone in business. easy to learn and navigate. my clients love the fact i can give them a written proposal or invoice on the spot.
. really easy to use
great app, very useful and always improving!. this app is the greatest tool in our businesses ability to streamline work, easy to use.
owner. quickbooks online, so far we like everything about except for the fact that it works like crap on an ipad. please come out with an update and patch work soon it's not worth it.
useless. can’t share the online app with my accountant. frustrating and useless!!!!
great app for any small business. this is a well polished app with regular updates and new features being added everyday. *credit card transactions are incredibly simple with the intuit gopayment integration. great job on the app guys keep up the good work!
. in general this is a good accounting app but lacks some of the features of the desktop site. the automatic email from the app and the desktop site is also more like its promoting qb than my organisation. new projectclient costing is very good so far.
can't log in on nexus 5x. i haven't been able to log in on my nexus 5x for 23 months (maybe longer). i can get to the login screen and put in my credentials, but when i click next it errors. tried uninstalling and reinstalling. even installed a qb app update recently if i remember correctly. still can't log in. tried emailing info to support, but i still have the same problem. i can login from my computer or ipad mini just fine.
great for small business. such a time saver, easy for business owner, accountant and bookkeeper to enter review and lodge bas. love the fact i can take photos of receipts to back them up and also add attachments to invoices etc. such a great software with web access also
thumbs up. wish it was cheaper, but i have to admit i love it and it makes my business easier to run.
. great app very user friendly
a great experience. this new update has just all the features required from this app and more. not just do you guys listen but act as well. kudos. the best cloud service, that can be.
. i keep getting a error that says unable to view payment because it includes finance charges. very frustrating when you can't view invoices.
one word. awesome. i love this cause i can store all the receipt online.
"awesome apptool. although i rate it 5 star, there's much improvement that can be made on creating ""invoices"" definitely needs more options and versatility. needs more custom ability in modifying the invoice into something fitting to each customer. overall, keep up the great work and adding new custom features."
. this programapp has paralyzed me from carrying out business transactions and estimations due to a failure in the app being able to sync my data for 3 days now, customer support is next to nothing when day after day they told me i will receive an email once the issue is resolved. i am losing money and this does not seem to be a priority for quickbooks.
love it. just be cautious when trying 30 free trail. i loaded half a dozen customers and lots of estimates,invoices etc. and then purchased the 6 month subscription after i got familiar with software. well it led to doing work twice. because you can only have one or the other, free trail discounted 6 months subscription.
qb intuit online app. fantastic program highly recommend 👍😀
. apparently i don't know my password or id, yet i just used the exact same login details to login on my pc... level of angry right now is fairly high
. easy to use. make business life easier
it's just not the same as online. though the app does do most of the basic functions that you can do online it is still lacking some of the advantages to just doing it online. it is convenient to be able to access it on the go but it should be as versatile as the online version, also some of the menus are a little confusing on the app.
very good for any kind of business!. quickbooks is great app for managing the everyday finances. it's very fast to send invoices, with this app all income and expenses are simple and quick.
there are other options .... not with the $35 dollars they take in addition to % of every transaction. i would suggest another program and app. i personally would like the app to be able to send reminders for invoices but the app will only send them out.
app will crash!. app will crash! be sure to save your work!
qb makes me look good. qb app is fantastic. i can write and present an estimate right at the job site or give my customer an invoice, or accept payment. in brief....it makes me look good!
. great app
. it really makes giving estimates & tracking invoices simple thats what i use it for a1
freakin awsome!!. every time i asked for certain features in future updates......they did it!!
. very helful. saves time and energy in the evening by allowing me to do all of my data inputs on the phone as they happen.
. problem tried to sync my company data, refresh it. and now the app crashes as it is loading my company invoices. it seems to log in fine. just gets hung up when trying to load. was working great at the end of last year. but now it won't work....please help! i was using the app a lot. just want it to work again. p.s. i am using a galaxy s4 android 4.3 thanks!
very happy with qbo. first of all i'm saving a lot of time versus i tried so many apps. i even had qbo one time and canceled hoping i can win. not really quickbooks online is the only way to go. very straight forward.
dirty tactics for subscription. unsubscribing to this app is so difficult. an error prompt always appears everytime i process unsubscribing. but if it’s any form of purchase, upgrading, downgrading, anything other than unsubscribing works just fine. no reply from their customer service since i contacted them a few weeks ago. i hope other people who has the same problems with this app comes forward so this developer stops milking money from unwilling customers.
. good app but could definitely use a few key features added to make it that much more usable for my type of business
just no. the app isnt compatible with the galaxy s7 which is really inconvenient. 👎👎👎.
like. loving the app!! thank you!!
useless. this app is useless. you can't even see your check register. pathetic.
quick books makes my life easier!. doing estimates and sending invoices is easier then ever!
best accounting software. so easy to use. has so many features.
. can't create an account. fails every time. can't update due to server failure. no support available either.
"love it but it could be better. i want to give it 5 stars but due to the fact that my customers can't view their quickbooks invoices and receive an message saying ""error we can't retrieve the requested invoice"". please fix this issue asap so my customers can pay me! thank you."
awesome. it saves me so much time. great to keep up with my business accounting. mostly simple to use. some features require a bit of basic accounting knowledge.
keeps everything in one place. great app! i keep all my business and personal expenses logged and in place from my phone. i can also track multiple companies. gives me so much piece of mind and way easier for keeping track of taxes and book keeping.
. wonderful app! extremely helpful when needing to createsend an invoice on the fly
. this is not for bookkeepers i uninstall this app
app crashes in ios9. this app was working great before the recent update. app just crashes when i try to open. i use an ipad 3rd gen running the latest version of ios9. please fix!!
best app ever. i am a tech on the go , and we made the switch from paper invoicing to quick books online. i cannot tell you how much this app saves me on time and frustration , everything is there at the tip of your finger. thanks intuit for making my work that much easier!
great small business tool. excellent on a laptop, doesn't handle banks with authentication dongles very well, mobile app doesn't handle them at all. can't do payroll from mobile. receipt tracking is easy and works well. reports and snap shots handy.
. everything i need and so easy to use as a consultant. i invoice and make banking and purchase entries in real time, i no longer need to sit for long periods of time playing catch up.
. i trust this app
great app. added immensely to efficiency of our business and interface with customers
can’t use it in iphone or ipad! keep getting error.. i keep getting an error! queryprocessingerror:null
. does not support in india
good program. wish i could see if my estimates were “viewed”, like my invoices.
quickbooks = easy bookkeepping. love the mobile app, very easy to use. access accounts from anywhere, raise invoices, pay invoices. simplified bookkeeping!!
incomparable with ipad pro. this app works terrible with ipad pro. basically made this business expense a complete waste as the app and web program useless on the ipad pro. extremely disappointed and frustrated.
. quickbooks is the only company that charges 3.40% for manual transactions when swipe or manual transactions go through the same process. decedent company just takes a lot of money from us small guys
. so far for the last 6 months it's been excellent. love the app and quickbooks itself.
. this app doesn't work! such a disappointment to say the least! i'll edit my review once the app is available for use! still not working! uninstalling for now! i hope that you fix it!
. love this app
they discontinued this app. do not download this. they stopped the link so it no longer works. too bad because i was using this to run my business and now i'm screwed. i have to find another app quick to do my invoices with. i like razorsync for scheduling but i am not thrilled with their estimating and invoicing. if intuit had kept this up and just made some improvements it would be great!
. very limited features and too slow. even after 6 months of using they've not provided the payment gateway integration as available in others. no one handles the queries seriously after 5pm on phone call.
presently surprised. i really did not want to move away from the desktop version i purchased, back when that was a thing. however, i am really enjoying being able to create invoices, collect payments, etc. while on the go. so i suppose i will get used to this payasyougo thing ;)
great app. i love it. great!
unsatisfied. keeps telling me to contact support after trying to make an invoice very frustrating.
record keeping at its finest. works great and keeps my business records up to date at all times. so simple to use but capable of handling any business transaction you may need.
very useful. would live to see bank figures in there too
crap. this update is crap. my invoices won't update with the ipad. nothing like beta testing on your customers. typical for quickbooks
works great. good app. works great on the road for creating fast invoices on site. great companion app for quick books am dos fully functional.
good app but. it’s a good app but you should be able to mark invoices as paid and deposited via the app. my paid invoices are regularly, incorrectly shown as unpaid. i have to wait until i have time to go on my laptop and mark them as paid via the website
. just unistalled and reinstalled the app hopefully it is going to work. after doing over 70 invoices it stopped working dashboard showed blank 😕
app crashes constantly. i used to love this app. the last couple of months the app crashes daily and multiple times. i’m in the middle of working and the app says critical updates are needed and logs me out. i’m extremely frustrated with this considering i pay over $20month to use this software across all my devices.
app ruined. come on!!!!! the app is totally unusable now. can't save invoices, can't email them to the right person and can't create them with the correct info. this is the type of screw up that someone should be fired over.
. why can't i accept payments in the app anymore?
wow! loving the switch!. it's more than i had ever expected. using square or other solutions or good old fashion checks in the mail are nothing compared to how seamless qbo has made my life. that mac app, ipad app, iphone app and even the apple watch app give me the pulse on our company that i've needed for so long. can't wait to grow into more solutions with qbo!
. very useful app
nice, but naughty. i am writing this review at christmas, that explains the headline :) this app used to be awesome. now i get a lot of can not connect to data or can not refresh data even after multiple refreshes. hope they fix it
. really like the taking pictures of receipts. mobile app is great
el programa es bueno. lo malo que a los hispanos nos afecta que no esté en español, aparte de eso por vivir en usa que el software este en español y de la opción de imprimir en inglés los documentos. sería más que genial
very useful!. this app allows me to send clients a sales receipt as soon as they hand me the cash, invaluable when visiting clients.
good luck getting any tech support when you need it. not impressed! what a joke. don’t waste your time here.
. excellent, but doesn't show activity for the vendorscustomers. a rather significant bug.
outdated. the iphone app is way better and has more features including hours and quantity in invoicing. this app really needs updating
best app to fallow my customers!. qb online + qb app is the best!
"best app tool for small business. i love everything about it. just please change when emailing estimate, remove ""please pay"" and change to total estimate as it is only estimate and not an invoice."
. now, can't even access some of my clients from the app. i have sent the error logs several times to intuit, but no response. it keeps getting worse. lacking the fingerprint option to login. also, accepting transactions from bank feed in android not as smooth as it is in iphone. app starts freezing after accepting a few transactions. additionally, progressive invoicing does not work in the app. should make it more useful for accountants though, adding bank reconciliations capability would help.
very nice. pretty good mobile app
. never could get it to work, after months of paying and a call into quickbooks (who do not support the product if bought through the playstore or apple store), i gave up trying to use this software. $160 out the window with not a single useful action resulting from owning this product.
. i've used different accounting software to see there was a difference in the softwares. well its a big deal. never will i stray again!!
ran into unsupported transactions within 1 minute.. the app is difficult to navigate, bloated and slow, using a ton of wireless data. the app would be much better as multiple singlefunction apps. i mean, do i really need to log in to qb to snap a pic of a receipt and submit it for later? typical quickbooks bad experience. very disappointing.
good start, needs more. nice gui, great start to all potentialy great tool for business. the app needs more options than just customer billing. thats half of a business. i want to be able to log expenses like fuel, tool rentals, etc via the mobile app as i make those purchases.
. so handy. like having an accountant in my back pocket.
. very useful app
another weak quickbooks mobile app. once again, with excitement i upgrade only to be letdown. when will intuit make a full function app? i love the message that tells me the function isn't't available for my device but i can access it from my pc...great, i'm still tied to my desk! why bother with the mobile app then?? i love how i can only rate this useless app once in the lifetime of having it,i would give it no stars if i could!
. good and simple
. wish i never started using quickbooks. i can't connect to my bank anymore . got the new app logged in and they want another subscription off me. waste of time and money. no actual support apart from the automatic ok ne which is as much use as a chocolate fireguard.
. being mainly a cis contractor it won't let me make invoices in app so have to use browser which doesn't work so have to wait till i get home to invoice from laptop. any chance of this being resolved
this is not qbo for ipad. this is qbo invoicing and expenses for ipad. you got me all excited for a moment! call me when you have the real thing, please... i want full functionality please please please! the dream continues....
. very cool for our business great app helps put us a step ahead of the competition and print an estimate on the spot from our truck selling the job automatically.
to glitchy. way to many glitches but worst of all it is supposed to be exactly the same on the deferent computers and some times the same invoices show up on one computer and not on my i pad and only sometimes on my i phone 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
some quirks but overall a great app. love the ease of running the office portion of the business on the go. this app is very easy to use and manage your customers and your business.
. pretty good app.
. seriously guys, this app is constantly updated, but still moves at a glacial pace and consistently crashes. get your business in order so we can keep ours in order!
freedom. great piece of software as i'm able to invoice customers right from a tablet and be on my way!! well done!
you need to purchase one per company. if you own multiple companies this software may not work for you. unless you rather pay double and in my case triple for each software per company. highly disappointed and no one that would solve it. regretfully invested.
. app worked good for the first couple of months but now hasn't work for a few days straight on my samsung phone. emailed the report to them but have received no reply.
bugs!. so many bugs with this! i just rated it before and it’s popped up again asking me to rate. and i could go into so much more, however i’m only using this until next year. it’s shocking. i have just sent 3 invoices, the clients have received them, but they are not showing up in the app.
. used to work perfect ever since update it's very unreliable. can't log into app reliably. it often locks me out right when i'm standing in a customer's house trying to invoice them or locks me out when i need to go through my client list for a phone number etc. i suggest you consider competitors software until the app becomes stable again.
fix log in problems. the latest update made logging in extremely difficult. i am no longer able to use my pin or fingerprint even though they are both enabled in the app.
. worst customer service ever.
love it!. so simple to use… i absolutely love this app!
. i love qb it does everything but it takes to long to get your money so i've been processing with paypal then copying it over to this fix this issue and 10 stars
. this is false advertising. it's not free!
. easy to use. mobile app is good for searching previously created invoices. i prefer desktop version for using all other tools.
nada funciona , nada de soporte y ningún tutorial. soy economista y sé cómo trabajar con aplicaciones y ordenadores . es una de las peores aplicaciones que conozco y si quiero saber cómo hacerlo no hay tutorías o quia que explica lo que quiero hacer . no la compres
. not supported android mobile in india. software means that either o mobile or computer should work equally both places, but your software has only web version then how to use your software.
. save's me from having to carry invoices.
flawed. i am going to reinstall the old app. the new app will not allow me to add a customer from my phone's contact list.
. superb app
great app!!!!. i am a simple tradie and this app has made life so easy! not complicated easy fast and effective.
not happy. when i first got the app i fell in love i had problems with the desktop version , with the bank option on the online version witch you removed i was able to log in my transactions very quickly , i would appreciate it if you would please bring back the bank option in the menu asap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
. zero! the app says it needs to update, then brings me to a screen giving a choice of uninstall or open. if i choose open, i'm back to the need to update. if i uninstall and reinstall, that's just more steps before i'm back to the same useless place. garbage software.
chief operating officer. phenomenal software.
. i cancelled my subscription over a year ago only to find out they has still been charging my account every month!
mohammed salman 6s. superb app all ledger's are in just my pocket my request is to app developer suppliers options suppliers balance
best quickbooks i have used.. this app does everything for your business it's quick it's easy and fast so i recommend this to anybody
having issues help. keep saying to restart app and i even master reset my phone for nothing. need help. very helpful when it worked
excellent app.. simple to use and very affordable.
need more work. it’s ok for beginners they still need to improve it
. very easy to use this program and sell explanatory. makes everything simple and painless.
. fantastic and very simple to use
. nexus 10 getting better with every update.
great app. i've started using quick books as i switched from kashflow it's much easier and has a great user interface.
easy to use. this app is so quick and easy. my business is on the go all of the time and it makes estimates and invoicing so quick and easy.
too slow. too slow, freezes, doesn't show if the email has been sent and other things... quick sale is way better.
dashboard is broken. app needs work.. the app dashboard appears to throw up numbers completely unrelated to reality and almost always reports inability to retrieve all data. the web version, on the other hand, works fine. it seems not much attention has been put into app development. disappointing.
. love the receipt scan
amazing!. i have used everything but quick books because of the price point mostly but because of a coupon code i received i decided to give it a shot and i don’t know why i didn’t start here in the first place. thank you guys so much, it has made my life so much easier!
qb keeps getting better. great job on the most recent updates! makes business on the road so much better. thank you.
bo. very happy with qbo
quickbooks lies again. this app does not track mileage as advertised
. 3 years and the app still doesnt show bills????? support case opened 3 times and no one care. wonder how can we trust them with our data
don't do it. can't bill a portion of a estimate have to bill it all at once! it will not let you see your job costs per estimate! this is a huge deal i can't believe they haven't fixed this yet. come on qb add another freaken column already! tones of other stuff on the accounting side that i don't know about is missing as well!
. great app!!
. this app doesn't work! such a disappointment to say the least! i'll edit my review once the app is available for use!
. seriously guys, this app is constantly updated, but still moves at a glacial pace and consistently crashes. get your business in order so we can keep ours in order!
made business that much easier. amazing, don’t know how i kept track of my business before quickbooks.
very convenient and usable. great app that connects me too my work platform everywhere i go!!
. first thing i try to do with it and it crashes. crashed 3 times in as many minutes just trying to link an account. garbage
bookkeeping on the go. i own a small tax and accounting firm and this app has done wonders for customer service! being able to give my clients real time information from anywhere at anytime is a huge plus! i only wish this app would allow me to process ach and credit card payments on the fly!
crashes, not usable, nexus 5x. crashes and no longer usable on a stock nexus 5x on android 6.0.1. app is now useless to me on my phone which is a major problem.
keep crashing. after last update keep crashing i can't create and send my invoice please fix asap
simple and easy.. great program, easily accessible. this program does seem a touch too simplified, and an enterprise version that runs and feels like this would be great.
error. the jan 2019 update is plagued with logon issues. i have logged out and deleted the app and then loaded it again on my phone to start fresh. even this does not fix the issue. no matter what, i get a message about critical updates being needed and it logs me out and crashes at each startup.
excellent!!. does everything it's supposed to
. error code 132.100 quickbooks doesnt even have a fix for it. customer service has no clue as to what they are doing. i like paying for software that i can't use
disaster to sign out. i happened to see this app and found it is interesting to scan invoices but turns to be that i have to be a “company” to use it and have to pay so much for it! so expensive!!!!!!
doesn't work. app doesn't sync all data with quickbooks online. i see only my company name and customer list. no invoices, expenses etc. intuit support we're not able to help.
getting better with every upgrade.. great app. they do lure you with the free use then hit ya with the charges later. i think it's a useful tool in the toolbox.
. awesome! they still need to improve a bit for the mobile app, as some things are not available on it compared to desktop, but really, i couldn't run my business without quickbooks online
"great app. needs to have a switch company button.. i'm an accountant and this app is great. i can use it on any idevice and it updates everywhere. i'll give it 5 stars bc of its simplicity to use, however, the only gripe i have is that it should have a ""switch company"" button or have a different app for accountants with multiple clients such as myself. please setup the ""switch company"" button soon!"
. small business owner. this app is terrible, do not not rely on it. does not work well on android devices, no matter how many times the browser is reset along with strong data connection.
. awesome app
great app.. will help me tract expenses!!
release ios 13 update now. i pay way too much money, and it’s going up in october, for you not to have an update day one ios 13 is released. you guys are always behind with the bugs. i cant even click on a customer, save an invoice, send an email etc. give me what i’m paying for.
. can you print from this app
"error. i dont even understand why massage always popup said ""failed to connect with server"" when everytime tried to login using this app..send several of email to support team but theres no answer n solution..please do something i am a quickbooks online plus subscriber.."
. every accountant's companion.
app doesn't work at all. after attempting to log in several times the app crashes every time. i cannot rely on it for work so it's useless.
would be great if it worked like it should. i keep getting error message 6000 when trying to save a new client on my ipad not sure what the heck that is but can't find anything online that discusses it.
crashes upon opening. do not install. keep your prior version until they fix this. upon updating the app no longer will open. i called quickbooks and they said it must be a known issue then.
. login with google sign on sends me out to my browser then asks for password creation. continuous loop back to app then back to browser. have not been able to log in once. followed directions online for help still unable to sign in. no other app does this. guess im stuck using my desktop for quickbooks. may have to look into an alternative.
scam!. this app won’t let you unsubscribe. forgot my password and tried all ways to access my account, but they won’t send me a verification code in my phone. i have exhausted all efforts to change my password and log in, but to no success. i reached out to their failure of a customer service representative, didn’t help either! scam!
limited. not much functionality compared with the desktop app, frustrating. unable to access banking or create bills.
a++++. great program!!!
. 2 weeks into using this app it has made itself unusable, going back to paper invoices thanks quickbooks!
super easy. great app and accounts program  easy to use after a small amount of training. so far i haven’t come across any of those annoying bugs you get in other accounts apps
. great app to keep working on the go.
what a joke!. quick books “backing you” is their slogan, should be backing themselves. only want your data and money. the so called “free trial is another scam.
system modify for the better. great system except when you send an invoice out there is no way to mark it that it has been sent out . so you constantly have to keep a note book with all the customers and what is going on with each individual invoice.
great way to keep up with small business book keeping. in previous years, with my software based quickbooks, i ended up doing most of my neglected books once a year for tax times. with this i do an update on a daily bases and will have do just a little detailing come years end.
. very easy to use with my mobile business. i can instantly manage my finances and customer service. awesome app!
app constantly glitches and it's very slow. i've had so many issues with this app. lately it has been extremely slow, it randomly shuts down for no reason in the middle of inputting a transaction and it won't load larger invoices. i'm very disappointed as i use this on a daily basis for my business.
. excellent app. the one i use most on my smartphone.
last version have a lot of issues. since i got the last update, the app crashes a lot and its very slow!!
. amazing app
. everything you could ever need to manage a business. financials at a glance and indepth, invoicing made easy, automated payroll, and so much more. 2 employees couldn't replace this app.
. very fine app
what a joke. downloaded this app so i could pay employees and taxes on time without having to be at my computer and i can't do either, i have to be in front of my computer to do both. i don't understand why it's not allowed on mobile app.
. i have been a quick book user for many years. great business tool. i use it for my construction estimates and invoicing.
. fantastic and user friendly
easy. this easy to use app is great for small businesses
. makes sending and tracking invoices simple.
"amazing for my business. i wouldn't know where i would be running my own business without this app. it truly gives an ""on the go"" experience and aided with other tools i can work anywhere in the world. thanks quickbooks!!"
new update keeps crashing. well ever hour or two it crashes while i am in the middle of looking things up or when i am making an estimate for a customer. and this is with the pastiest update. oh and it keeps telling me there is a new update, but i already have it. fix it, my renewal is coming up and you aren’t the only game in town
awesome for my business. can’t do business without quickbook. really efficient when it’s time to prepare taxe income report.
a+. awesome app. this makes my life so much simpler! super easy to use. 5 stars from this guy!
expected better.. for quickbooks having been the leader for so long in small business accounting software, i expected more from their online format and their app. while it is great for quick, on the go stuff, you can't add accounts in the app. you have to log into the web version for that. overall, i expected more and felt i stepped backwards in using online from the desktop platform i had used for years.
. makes my home business so much easier.
. it's a great app
. great app, easy to use, very helpful and profesional
so simple and quick to use. i have downloaded the app and have been using it for my self employed hairdressing. it is so easy to use and because i use my phone often it's great to pick it up at the end of the day and track my takings in which means i never have to worry about not being up to date. i would highly recommend this to anyone who wants an easy and simple way to keep detailed accounts!
. the app has stopped working. wont sync my data. very angry as i have customers who need their bills
mobile app works, but can be better. edit.. android works better now. i can see more info, but keep adding more features till it gets closer to the standalone program
. i was charged but unable to use the app or online account and had to subscribe again through the real quickbooksonline. google play charged me but i had no access to do anything in my account so i had to pay twice. the app designer made it right though and refunded one of the charges.
i love it easy to use !!!!. easy to use and easy to navigate!!!
does the job. great app for fast results
good so far. i'm new to this app. seems to work good so far. if it changes or if i can suggest something i will when i know more.
too good!. nothing beats qbo for its price and simplicity. easiest system to use for those sme not accounting minded but still need to get the job done!
. extremely slow. no it not slow wifi no it's not the device note 10 it's just a slow app
. ok. new version is better, but still lacks supplier feature. good for easy transaction...have to use web for more complicated stuff. good app! no complaints other that it obviously ment for the simpler side of the accounting management equation. good design, have high hopes for more features in the future.
. it's a great app for the phone.
. the app is very restricted, kind of defeats the object when many of the online functions aren't available
can't create po's through app. i use quickbooks for 2 things mainly. to create estimatesinvoices and send pos once the invoice has been paid. i can't create po's with the app so it's useless. i have to go to the website every time i want to create a po. it makes no sense that they would leave this feature out.
every small business needs this. you have no idea how this app boosted our mobile productivity, billing and cashflow efficiency. we are a family blue collar business, no one here loves paperwork, we love our phones and vehicles though and quickbooks online allows us spend very little time at the office and more time doing things we actually charge $$$ for doing.
. great app & software. very helpful. would be nice to be able to keyword search within all estimatesinvoices.
ran into unsupported transactions within 1 minute.. the app is difficult to navigate, bloated and slow, using a ton of wireless data. the app would be much better as multiple singlefunction apps. i mean, do i really need to log in to qb to snap a pic of a receipt and submit it for later? typical quickbooks bad experience. very disappointing.
awful software. i have quickbooks for years and the service is awful and the customer service reps can't help you. plus read the small print about the merchant account i have been paying 4% on credit card transactions. simply horrible
great for my small business. this works great for my small business. it's easy to enter invoices and set up customer accounts on the go. my only down fall is that when you email a customer an invoice. it does not give the pay now option like when you email from the computer version of quickbooks simple start online. it just gives a pdf copy of the invoice.
very limited functionality. the app has very limited functionality  i can’t even see the purchase ledger on the app never mind post invoices or take photos of them. lists supplier contact information only, not even account balances. useless. i have to log on to full site and try to navigate around it on phone screen which is difficult. oh and by the way, very unhelpful customer service too!
horrible!! worst waste of space ever!. would give negative stars if i could. absolutely horrible app, can't do a damned thing; can't enter or edit or view bills, can't enter new customers, can't enter new or edit existing invoices, can't enter new expenses or edit existing, can't enter or edit payments. can't figure out what this is supposed to do except take up space and cause frustration. do not waste your time downloading. like others said, use excel and a shoebox.
onion vs. desktop. i have just purchased the desktop version. i would.like to use the app to record my expenses on the fly. from what i can tell you need to have an online account to do so. please help if there is a way.
nothing adds up. when you run a business you want your numbers correct. i don't have time to troubleshoot why your software can't add a simple paypal balance and leaves transactions out. your fired!
work done sheets. this is good. could there be a work sheets which can carry information like cossh, removals of waste, costs of material and work done which could be added dates gps photo to the invoice. i really think this would make this program the best. cheers tim
. clean and intuitive great app for in the field estimates, this is probably my favorite feature. payment entries for cash payments is handy onsite as well.
. great app, very ready to track income and expenses. making and tracking invoices is so easy even easier then on the computer, reports and everything is really easy to access and track.
crashes. since the update to ios 9. totally unusable. i have uninstalled and reinstalled and keeps crashing on my iphone 6+.
. excellent app
great. for ecommerce in india, please add easy integration of csv files from marketplaces directly to quickbooks. third party apps are not upto the mark.
slow books. can’t accept transactions in banking section. sluggish app, end up using the computer more often.
fix it!!!!!!!!. when it works i like it, but when it flips out it is so frustrating. every time they update it it takes another couple updates to fix it. leave well enough alone!
design and user interface is outstanding. very simple to use..
solved my invoicing problems. now i can invoice quickly from anywhere. then track and record payments. very simple yet powerful. love the mobility.
great app. it's a one stop accounting app for me and it's made my life so much easier having it.
horrible (the website version too). so obviously not developed or supported by anyone with any accounting knowledge as this is the least functional program i have ever seen.
i can't run a business with quick books. the format is different on my ipad that it is on my iphone. i don't have the ability to do half the stuff i can do from my computer, which is a huge inconvenience when i'm in the field. i wouldn't recommend quickbooks or the apps to anybody.
i like it.. this app is pretty easy to use. i just wish it allowed you to send a statement from your phone. i also hope to see the ability to add interest on overdue accounts.
owner. i can't add attachments without it freezing. crashes constantly and touch id does not work
. been using this app for almost a full year was working great, now get error and will not sync data. if it does not get fixed will be forced to move to different accounting solution update; tried your solutions and emailed the error to support multiple times no response. i created another trial account and that one retrieved data no issue. it just wont retrieve data on mobile from my actual company account.
login will not allow me to paste my password. i use quickbooks online, so i use a very strong password that is stored in an app (1password). it would be extremely annoying to hand type a 25 character random password into this app. and i'm unwilling to compromise my security for my online financial data. therefore this app is totally useless to me.
intuit keeps working it but stumbles on occasion. i've been a qbo user for over 4 years now and run my whole oneman business on it. each app version is a bit better than the last and they do fix bugs when notified. i continue to be happy to see intuit continue to improve the app and the web interface. the blanking of bank account data in the dashboard appears to be fixed in v5.3.
easy to learn. easy to learn good support. i would like to be able to upload invoices sitting in my iphone pdf or ibooks app, or even better, directly from my email attachments, into the qb app when i am entering expenses. currently i only have the option of entering a photo. best wishes, dee
many bugs. need to fix bugs that cause the app to not follow the regular online access. employees can see things they shouldn't (like business income) and are unable to do things they should like entering customer info and invoices.
almost great. so, the limited features in the app seem like just a lack of time to include. otherwise, easy to use, and great way to keep track.
nice app!. suits my needs...
"quick books is the bombdiggity!! ya heard!. as a small business owner it saves me time, click, picture of the receipt, click and the expense is logged in real live time. no more saving piles and piles of receipts. it also pin point tracks your expenditures. it's the ""bombdiggity""!"
. problems sending invoices. update to customers from ipad doesn't always work. other issues. still a good app.
. i am a electrician and gas engineer, product is great , can do all invoicing on the move
customer service is great.. had a little trouble setting up called customer service and they got me up and running.
the best for small biz. to be able to login and get to your quickbooks anywhere is awesome! if you love the ability to work at different locations using dropbox because your files are where you need them, this is the same level of mobile convenience because your data is always where you need it!
easy. i have found this app very easy to use. being able to tap into your invoicing system when out on a job. it enables me to issue an invoice same moment the job is finished and emailed to my customer stood in front of me, that way my customer has a paperless invoice and can pay you right away. saves time!
. it's an ok app, tends to crash here and there.
keeps me on track. i'm so happy with qb. makes estimates, invoices and takes payment. that's what's most important to me. haven't used it to pay my bills yet. i'll explore it later. wish i could set alarms to do estimate followup. would be so helpful
no gst only take !!!!!. why is this an option the the web based but not the app. makes the app useless!!!!!!!!!
can't even start the program. i use quickbooks online. when i saw the app, i was excited. i cannot even get past the login screen as it continuously tells me that i have no internet connection (even though i do). if i can't login, the app is useless.
. the app use to work fine but since last month i can not update any invoice in the app. it keep givig me error unable to edit. there was adding this invoice. if this problem continues please call customer care. i have uninstalled and installed saveral time no luck.
worse and worse with every update.. the more recent the update, the worse this app runs. worked great until they changed to a new platform and now it's slower then ever. to logging in or saving pictures out in the field, it takes an additional 20 mins on the job site just waiting for quickbooks.
business management made easy.... quickbooks has taken the pain and most of the time out of bookkeeping for my photography business. it lets me spend my time working with customers and get invoices out promptly to get paid!
. very easy to use, takes little effort to keep track of all your sales and spending. i do wish it had a spot to put miles withought buying the mile version though.
. great app
excellent app. keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
. can't login. the web version works at least.
gerald. tax . tax here applied is actually confusing as only sales tax is taken into account. it's as if purchases or expenses are not taxed. if you need to claim tax on purchases or expenses doesn't show anything. it's as if i do it manually or. how do i import quickbook intuit into quickbooks online. or why not merge some features in intuit to online. it's not only as you say to do invoice as you go but you can't account for your taxes.
quickbooks saves me time & money. this app has streamlined my business as i am always on the go. its easy, efficient and powerful!
excellent app. im using quickbooks plus online n also the app..its easy to use...but sometime delay to update in the app after do activity in desktop.. ☺
. i just need it to do invoices with 2 taxes and it seems to work good
. convenient, but sometimes it freezes.
quickbooks online. the application what ever so far developed is 55. (smooth, easy to use, great ui design). but there are many existing features missing between web and app. an by quickbooks online itself can have lot more basic features which is available in many other pos softwares to manage a firm. your updates are very minimal or nothing. developments are slow!! support team is reactions fast for the queries (just reacting) but no solution for problems or no concrete answers for new feature request.
latest version is a disaster. face recognition does not work at all. you have to sign in every time you open the app and often get kicked out especially when switching between companies. colossal waste of time.
simply amazing for the newbie!!. as a sole trader, i am so impressed at how simple this product is to use!! it has saved my bacon on a number of occasions!! collating reports at an instant!! not to mention looking professional to my clients every time i send an invoice !! highly recommend this to anyone wanting to commence on the journey of being your own boss!! what a game changer indeed!
worst customer service. it’s like comcast great product but terrible customer service. i have online payroll service with them and i have been trying to merge my desktop quickbook version to online and bundle every time i call they transfer the phone to the philippine and they try to sell me the service that i already have (payroll) . it’s either they charge for full service or they irritate people.
don’t bother downloading!. this app was so hard to use, wouldn’t connect to my bank, wasted so much time trying. brought up all of my personal accounts transactions even though i asked it to hide them. wouldn’t bring up transactions older than 3 months. i honestly don’t understand how anyone can use it!!!
works great!. i am a new business owner and i have qb online on my pc, ipad and iphone. it is great to be able to record expenses and take photos of the receipts right when it happens rather than waiting until later and possibly forgetting. no issues found so far!
. good software, could be better if cis content was accessible via app
banking on the go!. it's a great app because i can work from anywhere.
works well. great app
. handy but a little slow
. always a great experience!
broken app. unusable. app fails to load company data. waited an hour on the phone and never got help. killing my ability to invoice customers while mobile, which is the only reason i chose the online version that i pay for every month! intuit is not intuitive, they're only into your money. zero support. zero answers. zero. the worst.
i spoke, they listnened. i have had my fair share of frustrations with intuit and when they send out questionnaires i answer them and my biggest complaint was no access to a p&l which is now apart of the app. it's perfect for what i use it for and there's nothing like creating invoices and getting paid on the go. great update and thanks for listening.
love this app!. i can send invoices anytime, anywhere from any device :)
. perfect for anyone in business. easy to learn and navigate. my clients love the fact i can give them a written proposal or invoice on the spot.
. there are many bugs and glitches. the ios version allows bank feed updates and this one doesn't!! still doesn't. still buggy.
beautiful app, curious about next features.. the revamped qb online is really attractive. still people coming from the classic qb are missing features. qb uses a great system to allow customers to vote for features. the success of the online version will depend on how fast qb development will be able to produce the big wishlist of new features.
doesn't refresh. it doesn't update on mobile devices.. plz fix it so that it will be more convenient
missing key funtions. app is great for billing and reviewing information. only function i see missing the would give this app a 5 star rating is it doesn't allow for time entry's to track employee times per job.
. good app very nice and handy
highly recommend. as an accountant, i use quickbooks everyday on a variety of clients. i wouldn’t recommend any other software. the cloud based platform is ideal for ease of access and management.
"update broke the app. since the update i have to type my password each time i open it after it has been closed for a while. this doesn't work in front of customers. (yes, i enabled touchid. the problem seem to be hitting others and is based on now intuit decided to ""fix"" touchid by breaking it in this version)"
new update. i love the app and it has been great for us for years. however, the new update does not allow a custom date range for reports and when you edit an invoice it gives you a small screen that not everything fits on. please bring back the custom date range and make is so we can see everything on edits.
quickbooks. great app. excellent business account program to run my business from my iphone.
qb online app. i love it! the app makes it easy for me to check on my business, record transactions, and review reports.
hi. app don't work
great app.. i am new to quickbook, but found this app as very helpful tool to run a small business, no matter where i am, at home, in the office or on the road. thanks +++++
should of bought it ages ago. such an easy to use app and system, back up support were quick precise and friendly. well done quick books
. does what it is supposed to do!
. there are too many things that it can't do so i end up back at my desktop. uninstalled.
buggy ios13. error email too long amount to high invoice can't add customers via contact address book goes dark probably a lot of other issues .
awesome but missing bank account integration. very nice to have the books on mobile wherever i go. make invoices, record payments, add customers and service on the fly is very cool. i would like to see the bank account integration like mint does.
engineering team won’t fixed the azlo banking glitch.. i’ve been trying to connect my azlo bank account to quickbooks for months. i’ve been on the phone and computer with tech support multiple times and every time i’m told it is being worked out. how long could it possibly take? you all need to pay some attention to this matter please.
. does basic accounting. cool. i paid money for this. clunky interface. settings buried in random locations. the desktop, browserbased, application is equally, if not more, terrible. this is a professional product?
. love it..works grear....i do like it on full computer better
. great little app. like that it syncs with online version. also like the big fonts and easy to read.
. only thing i wish is that the app was more gear to service type industry like pest control other than that phenomenal app
. very easy to use!! i do wish though that there was an option to send overdue invoices.
sssloooow so very slow. latest update takes forever to load splash screen about 8 seconds then face id happens fast then loading data: no problems. just takes for ever on the front side to get going.
outstanding. fix individual entry format for android for a 5 star rating.
kerry pabian. are you kidding me !!! app is crashing on my ipad since the update ! why do you always do updates right before its time to do billing ?
. updates regularly. keeps getting faster and more stable with each update. thumbs up 👍
. vary user friendly, takes awhile to learn all the ins and outs but a lot better then the old ways still. great for a small business.
not pleased. i put the qb online app on my new ipad thinking i wouldn't have to lug my laptop around the country anymore.... it does not have the functionality or settings i need in canada. it's made for the states, which normally isn't a huge deal because we are very similar. but i couldn't input my tax codes or even my province! lame........
best version yet!!. i run a company with revenues over 2 million dollars annually with qb. i can take care of everything i need from invoicing, estimating and accounts payable to payroll and everything in between. the app adds even more flexibility by not requiring my laptop or tablet to create these. the reports and reconciliations are second to none.
keeps crashing. i absolutely love this app...but since ios 13 install every time i go to use it, it crashes. i sent an email to support but need this rectified. once that glitch is fixed it’s a 4.5 star app!
. the quickbooks app has been a life saver! very easy to use and helps when i need to do estimates or invoices on the go.
app is pants. the app was working perfectly until ios10! now opens for .5 second and crashs! how do i run my business accounts on the go!!!! fix needed today!!!
. the app has been having system errors & technical difficulties since january. why? my credit card is still being charged monthly fees and the product that im being charged for isn't working. your system is broken & flawed. please cancel subscription and refundcredit my card back. i would really appreciate it. i'm not interested in speaking to another rep. refund...
. i have had this app for my business for about 1 year. every time i spent the money new transection comes up 2 time . and it's too hard to remove on transection.
great. efficient. user friendly.. really enjoying having this app option for my business. absolutely loving quickbooks intuit online!! really like it can upload photos of receipts. my only suggestion would be to allow photos to be upload to an itemized bill. thank you.
excellent accounting software. exactly meets my needs as an ecommerce professional. the reports are limited to pl and balance sheet, but that's is the heart of what you need. i've had it over 2 years now and love it.
awful. iphone app pretty much unusable in the real world. always wants to be signed in each time you open it, touch id feature doesn't work. today it's complaining the app needs to be updated before i use it, it then directs me to the app store where it shows i already have the latest version!
lacking bank register. i don't really touch the other features, i'm solely interested in coding bank transactions when i have a few minutes spare. cannot be done via this app.
. great app... easy to use
very handy accounting app. this app is very useful to always have a snapshot of your business at your fingertips.
pretty useless. very slow and painful to use, doesn’t let you bank any payments etc. probably only useful for those who wish to produce very basic invoices
. love that it automatically pulls transactions from my accounts and so many other features.
. tried twice now to add my bank account and no luck, keeps saying i'm logged in on another device but i'm not. been into online support twice now and they can't fix it so the app is pointless to me
keeps crashing. i absolutely love this app...but since ios 13 install every time i go to use it, it crashes. i sent an email to support but need this rectified. once that glitch is fixed it’s a 4.5 star app!
where are the invoices??. what is the point of an accounting app that does not show supplier invoices? dreadful. support was as helpful as a chocolate teapot too ...
"cheap. it's one of those slickly apps that pops up in your search result which is filtered to show only free apps. after you waste your time downloading and signing up, it tells you to start your free ""trial""."
what’s going on?. i’m paying almost $11month for an app that “can’t update payment information right now.” this has been going on for weeks. i can’t even send current invoices. pointless to have at this time.
. great app. makes quoting and billing a breeze.
makes my life 10xs easier. having quickbooks online is the best thing to happen for my business. i have more time to spend with my family and i’m also able to keep up with my business better. all of my information is right at my fingertips! love it!
". the app hasn't gone far, sorting a report won't change for ""this financial year to date"" u can select another option but revets back again. .. has so much potential.."
no grouping of customers or invoices. services that the regular version have.... i don't know why they didn't carry this over. if u have more than one customer base or if u need to send the same invoice to multiple customers you are out of luck. hope they fix soon very annoying
. love to be available to quote, inovice, charge, see my clients, etc. on the go. i just have a few times that wasn't available to log in but overall good app
. been using this app for almost a full year was working great, now get error and will not sync data. if it does not get fixed will be forced to move to different accounting solution
emailing invoices. this is an excellent app for tracking income and expenses. however, whenever i try to email invoices, it gives an error message that it is 'unable to send message'. will give five stars if this issue is worked out.
business on the run. quickbooks online with the ios app make operating a travel based business on the run simple. log invoices as you go. input estimates along the way. print and mail or email all at once at the end of the day. not to mention the helpful reports and expense management. i couldn't run my business without it.
. very confusing
unwanted changes. we pay for the service, yet intuit dictates changes to our invoices that have doubled our paper use as well as anger our customers. you make the changes without any notice or options to do otherwise. nasty, mean dictatorial behavior!
#1. the only business app i'll ever need...thank you!
. stan f. would be great if it has signature capture so that a customer can sign the invoice or receipt. the ipad version has the signature capture feature but quickbooks wants 12.99 per month just to be able to use the ipad app and other 27.00 per month for the online essentials account. thats 480.00 per year just to be able to get a signature capture feature that is only available for the ipad version. quickbooks too primitive
very glitchy. i like the features... when they work. i often open the app to a black screen and have to shut down my phone in order to get it working again. please have this fixed. it happens at least once a week.
keeps getting more user friendly!. the new video tutorials make it easy to learn. the portability of switching between the mobile app and the desktop version online is a priceless feature, thanks for all of your hard work!
. love this app. hardly have to get on my computer
do it if you can get it to work. i loved the mobil app but intuit doesn't support it any longer. they want you to do the $54.00month hosting instead. i called twice today to try to get this app working and they said it wasn't their app. if you can get this to sync with you qb software, go for it.
needs a lot more work. i downloaded both versions and i am disappointed that ipad has fewer features and functionalities compared to iphone version. it is more convenient to work on a tablet however until all the features are included i am just going to continue online. hopefully qb will send an update soon.
. makes our life easier without using the webapp
. it takes a working knowledge of what this app is capable of doing to fully grasp how useful it is. i am learning more every time i use it.
whatsapp on iphone. the experience is very good with quick books on iphone. but it is not connecting directly to whatsapp while sending the invoice. the invoice have to be first downloaded into the folder and later it has to be sent.
great softwsre. multiple devices awesome
great app!. a must for a small business owner!
mr. doesn't work on ipad pro or iphone. it says my subscription has expired. i have had it for several years and it still works on macbook but on ios it thinks i am on a free trial until 13th april but still locks me out saying i need to update my subscription. it is useless to me if it won,t work on ipad because i photograph all my receipts into the app. will cancel subscription if it doesn't work soon.
. awesome to keep my books neat, love how i can send and estimate via my mobile.
. simple, easy and quick. easy to use and keep your books. highly recommended
latest update crashing on iphone 7. app crashes 2sec after being turned on on iphone7. restarted phone, no luck
. user friendly for the droid not so much in the appleipad.
how can a customer approve an estimate??. why do you have the electronic signature function available for the ipad and not android?? it defeats the purpose of having a tablet on the job site. i may as well stick with my 3 part form.
. rubbish interface, doesnt send invoices when you press send, had multiple invoices paid late due to this, will be looking for a decent online app to run my business. how can an invoice be overdue if my customer never received it because the app sent it? how do i tell if my estimates have actually been sent? its extremely unprofessional having to contact my customers and ask them if they've recieved invoices and expenses because this software is not up to scratch.
. has made my life much much easier please include income list
will not let me access my info!!!. ever since i got new phones for my technicians ,samsung s5, i have not been able to access any of my customers, transactions, or invoices. i use qbo for my business, but have now lost all mobile capabilities. if not resolved, i will be forced to use a different accounting software. 5 stars if working properly.
works good. easy to use.. it's really easy to file expenses with this. that's all i really need a mobile accounting app for.
. good app
. words cannot express how unfriendly this platform and interface is. both on app and desktop. nothing is plain and simple, switching back to invoice2go as i've been trying to create an estimate for over 6 hrs here and it takes me 5 mins on invoice2go
brilliant. excellent accounting software for new small business. only issue i have is that i bought a subscription online and the app keeps telling me to subscribe
works good. makes business life easier and works great.
. sluggish, cant get bank account info. each log in was a hassle. i uninstalled it after 2 days. is this the beta?
billing. i subcribe my licence but i can't do billing ...or even upgrade online ??
took out deposit option! why?. i can no longer record simple deposits from the mobile app. i’ve been using quickbooks online for over a year now and make use of that functionality weekly. why did they take it away? not every deposit is an invoice payment.
. i would have given four stars except the tab function in the app has not worked in a few months.
not for indian. please do remember this app is not useful for indian currency so don't waste your data.
good app. i like simple, this is efficient for my small busines, updates are making the app better. i can recomend it is supper easy to use.
no purchase orders. for years now quickbooks has withheld the ability to create purchase orders through the mobile app. this is a huge issue for our company and it is quite frustrating that qb has willfully omitted this feature. i wish there was a way to convince qb to change course on this decision...
almost perfect. please add the ability to print or download packing slips from the mobile app. everything else can wait till i am back in the office. sometimes a packing slip must be done in a rush. mobile app is useless to me without the packing slip feature.
works great. enjoying quickbooks online makes looking at invoices while out of the office really easy. great features
app crashes. everything was great until one day the app crashed. now crashes every time i open it. reinstalled and same issue. help????
. doesn't have my back in its list, so it's useless. i've cancelled my subscription. when i contacted support, they were obsessed with my subscription, rather than the actual issue.
great functionality across platforms. i use qbo to do estimates and invoicing on a laptop, ipad and iphone. i occasionally swipe a credit card too and they all perform very well. little bit presentation on each device but they all work!
. excellent just sometimes login doesnt register
great mobile app. perfect for my mobile power washing company as all my customers and estimates are available at the touch of a button no matter where i am!
great app. love to have access to our invoicing and payment details wherever i am. super easy program to use.
email is my only complaint i don't like my emails coming from into it i want to choose my own email so my customers can respond please fix this. respond it's when i'm sending invoices or estimates
room for improvement. it is a great app. it has a lot of room for improvement. i need to be able to assign each expense to individual jobs so i can job cost. also i need to be able to create multiple jobs per customer, ie sub jobs.
great ui and mobile to desktop experience. i just started using quickbooks about two months ago and i don't know what i would do without it now. it's simple, easy to run a freelance business with. it's helped me become a freelance business and get paid which is the most important part :)
. absolute garbage...they will not email my paystubs to my people
app won't open after latest update! please fix asap!. app won't open after latest update! please fix asap!
not quite what i'm looking for. after the invoice2go update disaster, i read a lot of good things about this app. sadly it fell short of expectation as i was unable to change the invoice number, which i would think was a pretty basic requirement. advice on the internet seems to relate to an older version of the app as the information did not relate to what was on the screen. i won't be utilising my free trial, nor will i be subscribing.
. parfait pour la compta et la gestion de la facturation. simple, intuitif et pas cher.
. unable to edit or delete products on setup pretty disappointed couldnt load suppliers not an easyapp at all. plus the set tutorial is different to app presented for 10.95 a month
if i wanted a kick in the groin, well... i'd of watched the leafs with great hopes of the playoffs. that said, this app is the biggest chunk of dog crap in the history of humanity.. dumpster fire
better than desktop version. easier to use than computer version. much faster. very efficient. excellent for companies on the go.
simple to use on the go.. really liking how simple it is to use & track things.
new version problems. ever since the last update, i can no longer categorize and add income and expense from the app. it seems the buttons to “add” do not work.
. dreadful experience so far. bought qb 16th dec 2019 and cant get a call back from an english speaker to help me with set up despite multiple attempts! why is sales uk based but support isnt? this is 2nd review  1st disappeared!!! so disappointed and very desperate to get started.
quickbooks renew account??. renewed my subscription for a year and i'm still locked out, every time i log in it keeps telling me to subscribe for 1 month i tried to go that way and it asked if i wanted to change my current year subscription? makes no sense.. wish some (tech support or program owner) fixes it i'm about to cancel it all..... wy small business owner
. great app
finally signature for iphone. love it!!! all of my invoices are generated via my iphone 6, and it was frustrating without having that feature. touch id is a great touch! i like the ability to have different invoice options, but wish i could design it exactly the way i want it. keep up the great work with updates.
rnm media and sound. it’s a great app and system. lovely to use and easy to get around. they must just add online reception and receiving of payments. this will make business much much easier.
helpful. very useful though i see some improvements that could be made.
great app and super easy to use. very easy to use and customise. very intuitive to use and no excuse not to update on the go
. love this app.so simple to use. saves you so much time with your paperwork keep up the great work guys😀😀
brian peterson remodel. great app. wish i could attach pictures to estimates and invoices using my mobile app.
nice app. this is a really good app and i would give it five stars except i keep getting an error message when opening up certain accounts from the chart of accounts.
great for the mobile user. some bugs but they get fixed sooner or later
good app. easy to use
great cloud based platform with all the features i need.. qb online is a phenomenal cloud based accounting platform (when using apple products). quick easy invoicing, banking, payroll, and report generation for the business owner on the go. seamless integration from mobile device to desktop with realtime updates and editing across all users. this platform slow me to run my $1.5 mil small business from my bed, boat, camper...virtually anywhere i have cellular signal. it allows me to be as mobile as i wish.
great for mobile services. i'm a computer technician and i use this to send a invoice or estimate for clients. quickbooks has a brand name which is good when you email your clients a invoice, it looks very professional. the best thing about this app is the cloud base syncing of your invoice, clients, income and expenses. it's worth the money if you want good quality invoices for your clients.
finally. i am now not as lazy taking care of the books for the business. as soon as a customer pays me i am able to record it and not dread the end of the month or tax season.
very nice app. very easy to use and make my all estimates and invoices very smooth and keep the updates very soon
needs to improve. the more i use this the more i find things that annoy me. when reconciling the bank why can i not just add a receipt photo to a bank transaction. that way i don't have to add it as an expense then match the bank transaction. it would save me time. seriously considering giving xero a try.......
mgrm. great app
. haven't been able to access my books since early september, can only use desktop app, browser and mobile app gives error message. contacted support 4+, engineers are working on known problem...10 weeks and counting
. it's a good app only thing is sometimes it takes a while to upload but it could be the servers of our phone
. compact, quick access anywhere, great customer support, tons of learning videos. it has all i need, and more.
. great app, user friendly and very versatile!
. love this app for it's ability to let me keep track of my job expenses and billing amounts. i will certainly recommend this app for my colleagues.
. great app!
compatibility issue?. no problem installing it on my phone but will not install in my tablet, says it's not comoatible (both v6.0.1 marshmallow). what seems to be the problem? huge disappointment from such a well known company!
. well after the experience so far it's great when i need to merge all apps at home then i can rate better. customer service has been just awesome so far. thanks it makes tracking expenses easy as taking a picture and putting the irs info in.
. note 4 crashes
. cancelling your subscription seems impossible. i've emailed, called, used their help menu. it shouldn't be this hard. still trying to cancel.
easy to use.. does what i need it to do. helps me record my sales and expenses without a pc.
love quickbooks and intuit. makes my job and my life so much easier. thank you quickbooks
. error code 132.100 quickbooks doesnt even have a fix for it. customer service has no clue as to what they are doing. i like paying for software that i can't use
the software has been a nightmare recently using iphone and ipad keeps saying i haven't paid. i've written to emails and had absolutely no response to either no refunds either because i can't get the software to work unless i'm in mice studios on my laptop which is being fixed currently i won't be with me for the next four weeks so how i'm supposed to do any invoicing i have no idea this is absolutely ridiculous use sage...
. app is ok but the login process is cumbersome. i should be able to access the app with my thumb print every time.
won't install.. all i get is an error message.
awesome app. makes invoicing quick and easy.
app ruined. come on!!!!! the app is totally unusable now. can't save invoices, can't email them to the right person and can't create them with the correct info. this is the type of screw up that someone should be fired over.
. this app works well for small businesses such as mine. convenience on the go.
. excellent and easy to use accounting program, you can do almost everything on your phone or tablet, lots of great features.
. no longer working at all on my phone which is how i do 95% of my business. nobody to call or get a hold of to fix the problem since it is a 3rd party app.
using for almost 30 yrs and about to quit. very sad that they charge for every issue now, to pay a bill, to use an invoice, even to do a credit for a vendor. it's going to be less expensive to hire a book keeper!
. a lot to learn but works well.
owner. quickbooks online, so far we like everything about except for the fact that it works like crap on an ipad. please come out with an update and patch work soon it's not worth it.
. very confusing, it's easier to just go to the website.
mr reviewer. it's good software & handy
good software, app needs work. quickbooks online is a great way to manage your business. this app, while functional, still needs some work
". signed up, gave cc info, created account, password etc. system then froze, gave me no confirmations and started billing me. spoke with the ""chat help"" which is people who can't spell common words or understand english. they were unable to cancel my account. now i have to through mastercard to get my money back. thank god my business is not dependent on this ancient software."
great & smooth accounting app. very good up to keep on top of your finances . it's the best on the market.
suscripción suspendida! ya pague! pero sigue suspendida ayuda. ayuda ! esta suspendida y no puedo facturar
awful app  doesn’t fully sync with online data. i keep getting notifications about a 6 month overdue invoice, which i used for testing. however, when you try and remove the invoice, it can’t find it. the online version is fine if a little overpriced for soletrader business, but this app, which costs nothing, is worth exactly that. it’s next to useless.
helpful, but limited.. it is good for a pinch, but it very limited in the interface.
crashes every time. i used to like this app, but now it crashes every time. i cannot use it at all. galaxy s7 edge. support has not responded to my messages. nor my crash message notifications (and there have been plenty)
. extremely happy with qb online. from invoicing to expense tracking to customer payments via electronic check or credit cards all at my finger tips. any device 247365. best business decision for accounting needs.
nogo on ipad pro. doesn't look good on ipad pro and doesn't support split screen. need to be able to have qb open on one side and my project system on the other to create invoices.
very nice!. i love have this power in my phone! i can email invoices or print them out, all on my phone! this app is easy to learn and soooooo fast when you get used to it. there was a lot of thinking when they designed this app, wow
good but need more adding. covers all your needs a lot of options, nice app, few missing things like no specific area for the barcode when you creat a new item. it’s friendly use but need more simplicity other than that it’s ok
. i was not aware that you needed their main subscription of $25 per month to access this extra monthly charge. also i am still being charged my one month payment for thinking i could use this on my andeoid only and signing up. not impressed for a co.pany i worked with their software for years. now like microsoft, it's a money grab with subscriptions. sad. loved them for years.
. very usefull app
. why doesn't this app work at all on my samsung?? its saying it can't be supported.
. your log in process is pathetic. its always asking me to verify and that process takes over an hour most of the time as it keeps resetting to the main log in screen. if you can't fix this i'll cancel my subscription
. great app to use along side quickbooks online. i like being able to send estimates and invoices on my mobile device with the quickbooks app!
can’t subscribe after trial period. it’s a good quickbooks version but i started trial period made a profile and invoices but the app won’t let me renew subscription the buy now button doesn’t work when clicked on. now i may have to start another profile and lose everything?
. not being free hurts. if this app was free and did not require a subscription to use for us that buy qb pro i would give this app a 45 star rating. this app is not perfect but what really hurts it is the price being 10 dollars a month to use this app.
does everything i need.. if i could see my outstanding bills on the dashboard, i would say it was perfect. but even though qb have chosen not to include this requested feature, i am still happy to recommend.
. great app
. dont download this update if your using an lg phone... after update unable to sign in... i get thru the sign in screen then it crashes... pos
. great app
great small business tool. excellent on a laptop, doesn't handle banks with authentication dongles very well, mobile app doesn't handle them at all. can't do payroll from mobile. receipt tracking is easy and works well. reports and snap shots handy.
very handy little app. as said in other reviews it is a little different from the computer version but it is such an easy way for me to do my invoices on the go! it's all set to go and it tracks all of my invoices and sends me reminds of unpaid one too! great little helper!
app not working since update. normally i'd give the app 45 stars but every time i log in now it says sign in successful but there is no online account associated with the email and to start a free trial. however when i login from safari, i get in no problem. please fix as i am unable to access data from my phone.
really love it,. make me simple i can input data of company everywhere that i want... thanks for this great apps.
. doesnt work on my acer tablet anymore
great app!. help you keep track of your business records.
high hopes cause big fails. the app crashes all of the time. no integration with desktop versions but ok. i though i would have something on the go for small invoices. i can't get through the first invoice. all progress gets lost with the crashes. i love how much time i save with the desktop version. there customer service has always been terrible. they can't even have a fully working version for the trial period. fail!
less than worthless to me. who cares what customers are near me! i want to see banking information, view various account in qb, do real work on my ipad. i should be able to do anything on this i can do using qq online. should is the operative word here. don't waste your time and space on your ipad.
great app. thanks for the update. touch id works now and i'm not getting asked for my password all the time. would like to be able to enter my time though!
. great app!
. baixeii e testei na esperança que tivesse as mesmas funcionalidades do microsoft money, que so existe para pc mas, não tem, fica muito aquém.
. haven't been able to access my books since early september, can only use desktop app, browser and mobile app gives error message. contacted support 4+, engineers are working on known problem...10 weeks and counting
awful. slow, takes ages to load photos, can only load one photo at a time. constant errors where the invoice will be paid twice
awesome!. fantastic app. as a freelancer i am often away from my office. being able to create estimates and have my clients sign them on the spot has been great. and being able to send invoices from anywhere has absolutely changed my life! love it.
awesome app!. started my business with the start of this app since i'm a mobile mechanic and it's awesome to do quotes and invoices on the fly makes it easier to keep customers
this app is a need!. this app makes running a side buisness so easy and convenient that you can do nothing but make a profit! love this app dont change a thing
. needs the employee menu... i like this app and its convenient and all but there's no reason a simple function like the employee menu shouldn't be on it
very useful. simple and very helpful
awesome. this app is perfect
works great, most of the time.. when it works well it is great, and that is most of the time! of course it isn't perfect and hangs up or doesn't update sometimes without explanation or reason. overall worth using though as i do often.
subpressions. like the mobile app
great mobile app. this app is perfect for my business. i'm out of the office majority of the day so being able to send or create estimates and invoices is very nice. quick and easy
. very helpful software for small starters.
. great app
five stars!. has helped out tremendously when it comes to my business. it makes it so much easier to use then the paper receipt books. it helps me stay organized and keeps me updated to the second. thanks quickbooks!
customer files. sometimes all the estimates and invoices don’t show up in the customers file when i go into it on the app.
. i love the app so much, but if can add more function n reports in mobile app then is really perfect:) 23092019 i wish to ask, wether you can remove the function which not allowed to screenshot ? it is very frustrated when i need to inform my customer how much they owe. please !!!
good but. it would be great if you could take a photo of a receipt instead of having to scan and save to a location on the phone
why do you need so many permissions?!. why the hell would quickbooks need to use my microphone, contacts, wifi, camera, location, calender etc etc. if these are features, let us turn them on inapp rather than forcing us to let you profile us and sell our data
. mr 5 jobs omg its freakin awesome program
scanning receipt yet to be as effective.. i was using neat desk for scanning and it captures all bills. if quick book cannimprove receipt scanning for cab and other bills it will be wonderful.
. very close to cancelling my subscription as app doesn't work. after adding 45 receipts i get an error message that my request cannot be added and i should call customer support. have tried reinstalling clearing cache signing out and nothing works permanently very frustrated
works great!. i am a new business owner and i have qb online on my pc, ipad and iphone. it is great to be able to record expenses and take photos of the receipts right when it happens rather than waiting until later and possibly forgetting. no issues found so far!
brockton driving school. great app, keeps my business manageable on the go.
pdf note on ipad. why can't we add a pdf note on ipad app. i can do it by accessing desktop version on ipad. but it's a pain doing it that way. it would be simpler to add that option to the app. come on guys keep up with the technology. quit lagging behind.
. very easy to use mobile app means i can invoice quickly!
review. i am self employed, i find quickbooks is easy to use as my business is extremely simple. i do have an issue with the annual cost. i think that you should have different rates for individuals like myself who only use it a few times a week.
. worst experience ever!! do not use this app for payment processing. something they dont tell you is, they will put your funds on hold for 10+ business days and you will have to call 200 times to get them released, and they still won't give you your own money. i run a legitimate art and film business (llc and everything) and have been treated like a criminal. do yourself a favor and go with someone else for payment processing!!!!
cannot log into app. cannot log in.
. couldn't run a business without this app.
. i'm not sure about the functionality of this app, i was unwilling to continue trying to learn it because of a particularly bad customer service experience. i caught the guy speaking with me in a blatant lie while he was trying to charge me a large amount of money for a problem he couldn't explain.
. i downloaded this app and not once has it worked. it crashes when i'm trying to login. i've never made it past the login screen!
. i can not believe that this app is this bad. i can only see customers invoices that i have been to in last 2 months. i use to be able to see 10 years worth of invoices. please fix asap. unless you can carry a laptop at all times which is not practical this again is useless. hello quickbooks how about a fix?
tax preparation. i love quickbooks. qb has everything i need for my accountant at the end of the year. makes taxes soooooooo much easier 💗
signature doesn't work with ios 9. my signature for my invoices that i need to get paid on no longer works with ios 9. still no update!
efficient. does all the work, and reminds me to collect on overdue invoices. i love it! not very expensive either!
the best app ever!!!!. there's no word i can use to describe this app. this is the best app i've ever seen. the functionality and the ease of use on iphone is amazing. 95% of my daily transactions are done on my phone. i love this app. good job intuit. no app does it better.
. premier retour d'expérience positif après quelques jours d'utilisaton. 4 étoiles car nous cherchons encore quelques outils et la mise en page du devis facture pourrait être amélioré notamment par le rappel de produits déjà rédigés et les principaux outils gras italique taille de police
crashes a ton. this is a great app for bookkeeping for my business, but it crashes almost daily on my iphone. please get better engineers for the functionality of this app!! so frustrating when i’m in the middle of printing invoices and the app crashes! how am i supposed to conduct business that way!?!
. game changer. invoicing and tracking expenses just got so easy. it's amazing, and i am only sad i didn't know about it sooner!
shotcaller. 1 an only mf
superb. the app on the iphone is great. works perfectly and great for quick invoicing. the ipad app is even better as provides much more in depth information. even better both apps work seamlessly with each other. don't know what i would do without this app.
good, but could be great!. it doesn't allow you to giveoffer a customer discount (% off the customers bill). it also doesn't transfer the customer notes from estimates to the final invoice. we have to copy & paste or write the description all over again. otherwise, it's pretty user friendly.
great ap. great switch to online and it works ok but crashes sometimes and is very slow need to make it so it works without internet when there isn’t service and backs it up when back in service. like when you go to a customers place that is where there isn’t service.
easy to use. this app is so quick and easy. my business is on the go all of the time and it makes estimates and invoicing so quick and easy.
. zero! the app says it needs to update, then brings me to a screen giving a choice of uninstall or open. if i choose open, i'm back to the need to update. if i uninstall and reinstall, that's just more steps before i'm back to the same useless place. garbage software. update: this was a problem they had seen and were working on. they fixed it and informed me of the fix a few hours later. working now.
. game changer. invoicing and tracking expenses just got so easy. it's amazing, and i am only sad i didn't know about it sooner!
app crashes after each action. i use the desktop version most of the time but when i need to use it when away, it’s really frustrating that the app shuts after every action making doing anything painfully cumbersome.
". i laughed at one of the quickbooks employees response to the app being slow... they said their goal is to make it as convenient as the qbo app... lol lol bad comparison. online version is tragically slow, short of (what should be) obvious capabilities, even some quickbooks older versions have had for years. and, when challenged, their tech support essentially says ""we are quickbooks if you don't do it our way or using our workaround then you must be doing it wrong"""
. best app good for business
great app. been with quickbooks for two years now and still really impressed very easy to use and works across all platforms would strongly recommend
working great, love dashboard. app is easy to use on the go. some things are better done on desktop but for the most part can do a invoice from phone and accept payments. would be nice if inventory feature wasn't additional cost
"amazing for my business. i wouldn't know where i would be running my own business without this app. it truly gives an ""on the go"" experience and aided with other tools i can work anywhere in the world. thanks quickbooks!!"
still waiting for receipt feature to work. i have made multiple inquiries about the receipt expense feature not working and they haven't even responded let alone fixed the issue. this has been happening for over a year.
so glitchy!! 😡. quickbooks has the potential to be great. but this app is so, so glitchy! have constant problems with it and i'm really getting to the point of giving up and going back to sage. every time a problem is sorted, a new one pops straight back up. if they could employ some decent tech guys and get things working properly, this would be brilliant.
great little app. excellent app for basic book keeping invoicing etc and keep up with the book keeping on the fly. but to do the serious stuff you still need to work from a laptop or desktop.
horrible accounting program. barely an accounting program. one would think qb would create an online version mirroring their desktop software. navigating the online software is a headache, let alone using it for basic accounting purposes. of course qb ever improving their software is as likely to happen as me winning the lottery.
wonderful app!!!. couldn't sing the praises high enough. i run a small, single member managed llc and the quickbooks online app is everything i need. i can create and send invoices and sales receipts on the go, even have the customer sign right on my iphone or ipad.
i love it!!!!. i've been a real estate agent for over ten years & keep my expenses & income on spreadsheets, what a pain. this is awesome! i do wish however i could keep my mileage in this app also, do that & i'll give you six stars.
crashes non stop on ipad. crashes non stop on ipad
easy to use, even for a newbie!. great app. easy to use, even for someone with little accounting knowledge.
great app!!!!!. great app for your business. really makes things easier and proactive. it also tracks everything
always crashes and says critical updates are needed.. constantly crashing. new photo software sucks. can barely recognize the edge of a receipt against a black backround. have to edit every single photo.
. this app makes my life so much easier.
great app for my small business. went from excel and pdfs to qb..great decision! i'm very happy with it. one function i'd like to see added is integration with iphoneipadoutlook calendar.
if you have an issue reload the app.. that fixed my problem and it works great now.
like it so far!. at this point i have only used the free trial version of this app. i like it. i do wish that it was linkable to my bank account or at least had a register like the software version i have used in the past but i am still going to buy the full version.
. if you even subscribe to their free trial, they will call you dozens of times in a day. its too much. every time a new number, so i can't get rid off. heavy spamming. जीना हराम कर रखा है यार तुम लोगों ने
the essential app. who thought being on top of your accounts would be so much fun. benefit from the experience of the pioneers. you will be impressed to see how easy it is to use. trial this and you will thank your self for doing so.
ios 9. with the new os signatures on the iphone are no longer saved to invoices, instead the app just crashes. when people become dependent on specific features and then they stop working it leads to a lot of extra work. please fix this feature asap.
great app really does work for my business. really easy to do my accounts and invoices.
. good app
. no problems. real time bookkeeping
total crap. this app doesn't work. it shows numbers which doesn't make sense, you can't rely on it. i just go to safari web and login to my quick books account. please change it if you can.
best for small businesses on the go. i'm a cpa consultant that specializes in accounting systems and qb and its other products qbo are the most popular in our vancouver market. it's popular simple to use, has good built in reporting, and lots of apps. and it's adaptable for virtually all small businesses.
awesome. i'm a carpenter. this app changed my life, and actually gave me back a lot of my life. estimates done before you leave your customers house? how cool is that.
limited company. absolutely brilliant. allows me to create and send clients invoices no matter where i am. without doubt the best accountsbusiness management system available. so simple to use and effective
app is useless. receipts and notes entered in the app do not show in the register online without additional steps. it doesn’t even show there is an attachment even though i selected show attachments in settings. so what’s the point. absolutely ridiculous in this day and age.
half way. all i really want is something i can scan in my receipts with. they say they have this feature but they don’t. even the free wave accounting app has this feature and now i’m left wondering what the point of paying for this service is with an alternative such as wave.. not looking like i’ll be bothering to continue after this free trial if they can’t compete with a free alternative otherwise quite functional.
good but could be better. overall quickbooks online is a reliable usable and productive app. it continues to lack obvious things like an ap screen on the landing page and better shortcuts to accounts. but it does the job well.
drafting estimates. when drafting estimates, system should auto save as many times hours of work is erased if you don’t constantly save before stepping away. in addition when you click the description box there should be an undo button in case it grabs all the text and it gets erased by pressing any button in accident. two very simple and logical things.
great app for busy employersemployees. your features are reduced and it's not the exact same as when you use a pc but it is still really nice. i would not be want it to be as in depth anyways it's nice and simple. i would recommend it to anybody that needs quickbooks on the go. we do a lot of work in the field and it is really nice to do estimates and email them to the customer while standing right next to them.
. access is unreliable. i've had to reinstall several times. for the cost, this is unacceptable.
. saves hours of time linking with the bank account , quick and easy once you have the hang of it
bugs and bugs it a jungle. 1. kicking out of the app very often. 2. not able to email multiple invoices at one time. 3. limited search capabilities. cant search notes and description. :(
awesome app. as a small business owner i'm constantly on the go. this app is amazing. with very little effort i can quickly add a new client create an invoice and get paid how i want.
great app. i’ve been using this app for about a week now so far it’s been great.
. great tools to stay organized, track expense s and bill accurately.
easy to use. a simple easy app that keeps everything in one place
new to business and this is great. i have now completed my second year running my business and without a doubt i owe some of my success to quickbooks as i don't have an admin person it helps me manage things also creates the professional image i need. i prefer using the web platform but when i am on the go and making small purchases for clients i love to add the expenses to their invoice on my phone before i forget!
inferior to qb online on desktop. qb app on ipad or android does not not have even half of the features that qb online has on a desktop. i can manage basic invoicing, basic expenses, see transactions, and pull up basic reports... everything about this app is basic. i have to actually be on my desktop to access the full features of qb online. very dissapointed.
. great app. for on the go. can sync with any device.
. please make a simple way of uploading a photo to an invoice (instead of through create note option).
limited features in the app. the app has extremely limited features as compared to web cant send customer statements or edit recurring transactions or match partially paid invoices.
quickbooks accountant. client writeup software
. i can't even open the app. it just keeps closing.
. incredibly buggy, takes forever to open and crashes on every action. cannot move from xero to quickbooks while the apps remains this bad.
perfect software for the right companies. i absolutely love it! i have a small freelance design company, so i'm billing for services and commissions. there is nothing i need that it doesn't do and do well. i don't need inventory, estimates or payroll, so this program is about as friendly to me as it could possibly be.
excellent. quickbooks online works great for me and makes my work much easier especially with the phone app
did you not test the latest update?. crashes on startup... please fix asap. i use this daily. this used to work great.
update the update, please.. i love this app. i use it every day, but the new update (4.5, released yesterday) will not let me record payments or save new invoices. it forces me to cancel each time, which doesn't save any changes made. please fix asap.
great app. great app links well details on the laptop. can create invoices on as soon as the job is finished.
. great app for productivity for my sole proprietor, 1 employee business, this app is perfect for what i need, which is on the go ability to invoice customers
. if i invoice a client and they mail check or hand me a check or give me cash i cannot record income unless they pay online bank transfer or credit card. so i cannot accurately. so this app is useless. and horrible client management. also need to be online no offline input. also i cannot merge to qb app each charge 9.99 month. cannot merge date as qb has better customer tracking. also neefs time tracking for jobs
great app. this is a great app to have if you use quickbooks. glad to have it available to me!
crashes. app crashes every time i'm using a lg g5 emailed support for help 3 weeks ago no response.sent response never heard back.
the app have few bugs & the customer support sounds like they not familiar with their products. when you create a new customer and saving it and then you need to change some information in the contact it still shows the previous info contacted customer support few times and they are useless
please support iphone x & faceid. please support full screen resolution on iphone x and faceid
. for the entrepreneur on the go, this app is fantastic. i post my expenses with photos of receipts and create invoices from the car! terrific.
sign in problems. there should be a way to sign in without a password or touch id. for me touch id rarely works.
. after eading all the problems and seeing 90% of the reviews being 1 star im going to save a headache on this scam app should be taken off the market or sued for false advertising and costing people thousands of dollars. all the responses from support sound like they are prewritten for the complaints. please take app off the market and quit ruing the admin side of peoples hard work to start a business.
rave. i have enjoyed having customer information at my fingertips on this app.
keep crush !. my iphone version is ios11.2.1. i can’t open this app. keep crushing. please fix asap.
great app. love this app. it makes running my business easier.
makes business easy!. this app is perfect for the small business owner like me.
fantastic. easy to use on all my mobile devices. makes small business operations much easier when you cannot afford office staff.
. great app!
killer app. killer service.. the app is great, arguably better than the online version. great for keeping track of transactions and uploading photos of receipts.
worthless. i have never once been able to generate a p&l for a board meeting. the reporting function just does not work, which is the most useful part of accessing this program through a browser. also, even though i can enter a sales receipt, doing deposits from the + does not work and i am unable to make corrections that are relatively simple from the browser. this platform provides no service at all.
please update to support iphone x. please update to support iphone x
. so simple to use! i normally use qb from my computer but the app works just as well while onthego.
zero stars 10.3 is junk. i used this app several times a day. i run my business on this app. since april 10th i cannot access my data. my business is suffering and intuit cannot fix it. i still have to pay. tech support at intuit  quickbooks recommended i switch to a android. (i doesn't work on my iphone or ipad) i really do not want to invest in new hardware. stay away from intuit they do not care and offer no solutions.
great software. i have a small pest control business. this software is exactly what i was needing. between quickbooks with invoicing and the calendar on my phone, i don't need to get any of those high price business softwares....
predatory data collection. the app wouldn’t allow me to accept payment without my giving it geo location. why do you need it, other than to use it in ways completely unrelated to my bookkeeping? the app was already near useless. good bye qb app!
. doesn't actually show invoices or customers. features are mostly broken or sporadic. using the website is a much better option.
. first of all i want to say that qb online is the best accounting software.unfortunatelly the app crashes on samsung s8 oreo.hope this will be fixt soon as is a shame,beeying such a great software.
perfect for small businesses too. all the tools needed plus user help forums, makes book keeping and accounting so simple.
. excellent app
horrible. do not waste your time or money. after a while they hold your money and cause a ton of financial difficulties for companies who rely on getting paid. there customer service is bs..........do not use
. this software is extremely easy to use and worth the subscription. i started my business last october and i have no interest in switching. cheers apollo butler c.e.oowner of hornet waste management.
update the update, please.. i love this app. i use it every day, but the new update (4.5, released yesterday) will not let me record payments or save new invoices. it forces me to cancel each time, which doesn't save any changes made. please fix asap.
limited, no balances. it allows you to enter expenses and sales oriented transactions, but does not allow you to view account balances. right now it's of limited utility
. my only dislike is that on android it will only being up the last year of data... where on my daughter's apple it brings up all data from many years ago
. cool app!
invoice missing. i sent an invoice from my computer but is not recorded in mobile app. prob wont be buying
. card reader does not work for htc. card reader does not work
at $12.99 month not free (false advertising). imagine my surprise, i trusted qbooks desktop to run my company, not sure i can trust some goof advertising free app and not letting you see anything unless you sign the free trial then $12.99month
. very useful app that almost makes bookkeeping fun. almost... :) let's face it, bookkeeping is a dreary chore but this software makes it tolerable and even pleasant some days. good work quickbooks!
it’s ok, but.... it not very useful as field service software. it’s painfully sloooow to use. even on the pc it’s the same. the software crashes when i need to use it or it’s syncing.
worst service. changed a template i have used for invoices and estimates for 5 years without warning or reason i cannot access the ones i sent even one week ago customer service said i was using a classic template and it's gone and not coming back . makes zero sense it's 2017 get a clue . don't buy don't join charge back!
major flaw. the app ui is pretty good and i really like the interface. the problem is that a lot of my invoices are not even viewable on the app. basically anything that has a delayed charge on it won't show up so there is a major glitch there or something.
terrible. terrible functionality. doesn’t process many transactions. don’t buy.
. little difficult to use interface can be made more user friendly but still very helpful app to use. definitely recommend ed for buying the package of available on discount
very easy to use and good app. very easy to use and good app
. takes awhile for the accurate data to load. you have to refresh a few times. does not pull up anything when selecting any kind of activity on a customers account.
. the app won't let me sign in. i've even reset the password and uninstalled the app and tried again, but i keep getting password error.
perfect for business on the go!. love that i can do invoices and deposits on the go
decent. not bad not bad at all
user friendly but. this program is extremely user friendly and makes book keeping easy for small business owners but the cost of doing payroll for employees is extremely expensive. i have 5 employees and it costs way to much for me to use quickbooks 👎
worth it could be improved. works well, my only complaint is different functions are available or not available depending on how you access quickbooks. can be a little frustrating when i need to send an account statement and have to do it from a pc as that option seems to be absent on iphone and ipad access. better than my other invoice options by far worth using for sure.
. it's good but could be better. limited functionalities on the mobile app.
great for mobile. i have enjoyed using the app. has what i need for most part.
i'm underutilizing this app!!. this app is way more capable than the extant than i'm using it for! the best for of the app is on the ipad. the worst form is on my mbp.
. origionally i wanted to use this app for easy application of spreadsheets and invoices, unfortunately when everything wasn't working out for me, i decided to pull the plug and cancel my subscription. unfortunately, it is hard to get a cancellation and stop the reoccurring payments and it has brought me here. i would recommend that you guys make it easier for others to manage your subscription accounts.
easy. great design, easy to use interface and great for quick overviews and adding data
just barely ok.. app has multiple issues . with page format. browser must use google chrome to get all options . called 3 times , on phone over hour each time . weeks later still nothing fixed . app is very limited .. customer service is a joke . here i thought i was upgrading to a better software . lol i was so wrong ..
great !!. has made running my business so much easier !
. awesome awesome app.. could use the date option for invoices though
a pretty good app. update: they added deposits! it does everything i need now, upgrading to 5 star! all in all, this is a pretty great app. it does just about everything i need it to while on the go, but it is missing one key piece of functionality. it does not allow the recording of deposits and that is really important for me. other than that it functions flawlessly and has never given me any trouble. overall, i love it!
bad program. won't send estimates and invoices. buisness cash flow has been screwed up.
app needs help. great desktop program. the app needs to be able to track mileage and time on a job. that's really my only complaint the more i use it the more i like it
great app!. so easy to use, really makes a difference to be able to invoice and do payments on the move.
. literally couldn't even sign in. didn't recognise my details even though i'd just signed up and was forwarded to that page by the sign up process page. wouldn't send a reset password email. honestly totally worthless and wasted my time. non starter. not even worth an admin response as it's been deleted and the competition installed already.
the android app is so diffrent than the ios app.. ios app has the functionality to select multiple items too an estimateorder with the multi select feature. this is missing in android. also before the update, the send comand asked the way we wanted to send the invoice and we can select email, fax application. but with the update it only send with the quickbooks email. cant send by fax anymore. please provide the share option on invoice and estimates atleast.
app crashes constantly. i used to love this app. the last couple of months the app crashes daily and multiple times. i’m in the middle of working and the app says critical updates are needed and logs me out. i’m extremely frustrated with this considering i pay over $20month to use this software across all my devices. no resolution or contact from customer service. it happens almost weekly. what a nightmare. looking for alternatives.
intuitive and robust.. a welldesigned, robust application. with functionality that crisscrosses accounting and nonaccounting domains, this is definitely a winner and a keeper. as other reviewers have said, support is amazing. the app is always evolving and improving. 5 stars for easeofuse, robustness and flexibility.
time tracker missing. the online version is friendlier then the online desktop version, but all in all a great app. one thing missing is the time tracker. would be great to be able to track your time spend on a project and book it to an invoice.
amazing app. excellent service?
google signin never works. i have tried and tried to get into the quickbooks app using the google signin. i get it to work maybe 1 out of every 50 times i try to login. i don't know why they haven't fixed this issue yet. i always end up logging in on my mobile browser instead. fail
pretty good. love that i can enter payments wherever i am. don't love that i can't easily see my account transactions.
