excellent. wonderful tool  has improved use of foreign currency transactions.
. get error message when i login on a mobile phone. works fine in mobile browser and on the desktop. app used to be great but cant even access the tools that i'm paying for anymore
ok app. easy to setup. big difference between windows version and ipad version. like the amount of critical info showed. on the windows version all critical info is shown. on the iso device not enough info shown. like cash sale,
credit card interface is awesome. i know all apps aren't perfect, but this one does everything i need. i'm so happy when i can set up a new client, invoice and receive payment immediately! this has really improved my cash flow!
makes it all the easier. program runs excellent always active on me note 3 a couple of things id love to see added. purchase orders and file attachments to invoices this would perfect it for me.
crashes w ios 9. app crashes after you enter password. intuit has had 3 months to test on beta. customer service has no idea what ios 9 is.
doesn't sync. app doesn't sync with qb, banking features (adding expenses, vendors) also doesn't sync with online site.
. 1720 update  i had used the mobile app for android for quite a long time with no issue and then approximately one month ago after an update the dashboard no longer has any information and is blank. i can still see activity but there's no way to get to customers or any of the other functions. i've emailed previously with no response. previous review: works well for viewing quickbooks info and taking payments
frustrating. decided to go with qb to simplify my accounts and let me do them incrementally through the month. very disappointed that sync works intermittently and leaves gaps. may be returning to paper is it isn’t sorted soon
simple and easy. simple and easier to use than the desktop version and everything is accessible anywhere you go.
not an intuitive product. i'm very disappointed with this product. i've used quickbooks on my laptop for two years as well as the gopayment app. this has been extremely frustrating to setup and use for both my accountant and myself.
. i love this app. anyone with a small business should have this!
. works we so far. just started using it. i like that i can create and send invoices from my phone.
. i can't use this app at all because it will not sync to my bank. not the app or any of the services offered. i'm trying to cancel all of my subscriptions and services and it seems impossible to do. directions for canceling do not work. i have yet to see any cancellation choices in any drop down menus. i'm paying for services that i can not use and unable to cancel which is a scam.
all is a life saver. great support team even if you can't figure it out yourself
works great. works great for my small business. not sure why there are bad reviews, qbo keeps up with my customers information, invoices, and estimates. very easy to use. now on this last update, i did have to uninstall and reinstall on my andriod phone, but within 5 minutes i was back up and running.
. easy to create an invoice, a little difficult to look a customer's information via the phone app.
like. nice app , liked
. easy use for on the road estimates and invoices.
amazing app. excellent service?
loving the app. glad i discover the quickbooks app. have just started using quickbooks and must say i'm impressed and now that i have the app its just taken managing my small business to a whole new level. hats off to the developers and all involved.
. great accounting app. would not be able to run my business without it.
. great app
. será que me pueden ayudar, no puedo hacer ningún tipo de registro en el sistema. envié un correo y nadie me ha respondido
. decent it's ok for adding expenses... but account balances are significantly lacking... i.e. non existent! must have!
. this app sucks and has for years! maybe if they charged us $1,000 a month then they could get it to work. maybe they just don't care enough to make it work. samsung galaxy s7 will not show entire history for past customers. mildly important!
. perfect app for a small business
business changer. changing the way i do business. my first sale paid for the app.
downloading company data 247. when the app works it’s good and the recent updates have proved helpful. however 9 times out of 10 i am unable to use this app. it is constantly in a state of downloading my company data and while i do this all i can do is wait. very frustrating. as a result i have access qb through chrome on my phone and that has a number of rendering issues.
full functionality missing from mobile app.. quickbooks online and the mobile app do not communicate effectively. it's like running two different programs that aren't fully integrated. mobile app lacks time reports and seamless expense invoicing especially in expense details. attempting to add item descriptions to expense reports does not work. there simply isn't a place for it. also, attempting to view a transaction with time, mileage, or reimbursable expenses results in an unable to view prompt. as such the app gets one star.
fix log in problems. the latest update made logging in extremely difficult. i am no longer able to use my pin or fingerprint even though they are both enabled in the app.
bad update. was close to perfect, or at least practical. since the last update, this app is useless to me. hoping this will change!
. best value accounting app hands down
. this app has told me there is a temporary problem on and off for approximately the past 12 months. this app is detrimental to my business. please fix asap!
release ios 13 update now. i pay way too much money, and it’s going up in october, for you not to have an update day one ios 13 is released. you guys are always behind with the bugs. i cant even click on a customer, save an invoice, send an email etc. give me what i’m paying for.
quick books. so easy and simple. just the basics to fit the mobile phone
one of the worst decisions ever!. i decided to move forward with quick books because of a friend recommending it to me. this has been one of the worst experiences ever. the customer service is terrible and the fact that quick books owes me money is even worst. i highly recommend that no one uses this service.
outstanding app!. owning a small business has enough headaches as it is. with quickbooks, estimating and invoicing projects and services couldn't be easier! everything is streamline! here's a look inside my day to day as a landscaper using quickbooks: initial client meeting> estimate delivered before i leave the property.. bam! they call back that night or the next day and we have the job. after we finish the project, turn that estimate into an invoice on site.. bam! paid! $$ in the bank!
. really easy to use. highly recommended. would like to see payroll either included or developed separatelylinked.
amazing. at last i can invoice on the move and do the rest of my book keeping as i go. great app and easy to use.
qbo ipad better. qbo for ipad is much better. the report functionality on the ipad is very much effective. if reports functionality is added this app, it would be much better.
. 1720 update  i had used the mobile app for android for quite a long time with no issue and then approximately one month ago after an update the dashboard no longer has any information and is blank. i can still see activity but there's no way to get to customers or any of the other functions. i've emailed previously with no response. previous review: works well for viewing quickbooks info and taking payments
greatest app ever. i love the “capture receipt” feature. makes life a whole lot easier.
stopped recognizing transactions. after the last update it stopped recognizing transactions. even after the manual editing, still does not add them to my income. the same with the desktop app. the only difference is that the manual editing works on desktop.
. my favorite accounting software!
amazing. great app and really easy to use. no need to wait to be at the office to do any transaction, all done easy and simple right on the spot!!!!!!!
convenience. i really love the convenience and accessibility of this app and quickbooks online. since switching from desktop pro to this i've been able to keep up with paperwork in the field. i think it's great. i just wish they made an upgrade so i could automatically subtract expenses from specific jobs. having everything separate is a real hassle.
. great app
. was using quick books online on laptop and it was fantastic, now since have to be on the move, am using on my android phone to generate invoices and it amazing experience, just dont need laptop anymore. great stuff. recommend to all smes
. no problems. real time bookkeeping
dangerous. this app would like customer number, passcode and security number if you want to sync bank accounts. this has been confirmed by lloyds, bank of scotland and santander that doing this is dangerous. as you are giving them information they need to access your account and if anything went missing you would not be protected and this information should not be inserted at anytime
. love it. need to add ability to add bills via mobile app.
current update just crashes. ios10 with the new update on ipad don't work. app opens then immediately closes.
. great app. now if they could only add payroll...
customer files. sometimes all the estimates and invoices don’t show up in the customers file when i go into it on the app.
. can't connect my bank account. please fix this error. i have to manually put my expenses in the app because when i try connecting my bank account i always get a pop up saying an error occurred.
. how about an update to the other app? suggestions that have been requested: 1) access to notes! 2) insert item above or below another on invoice. 3) merchant services integration. 4) take photos and attach to customerjob. 5) time tracking, the ability to punch inout for appts. 6) signature capture...things to be fixed: 1) map link still populates the customers name in the search (this was supposedly fixed, but it isn't). 2) support for custom fields on templates 3) editing of invoices and
. wish i never started using quickbooks. i can't connect to my bank anymore . got the new app logged in and they want another subscription off me. waste of time and money. no actual support apart from the automatic ok ne which is as much use as a chocolate fireguard.
pretty useful!. i can add my expenses and match them later and now they even. updated the web internet so i can use it on my tablet and it's become super helpful! thanks quickbooks! i think what's they update it to where you can do all the thing you can on the tablet web interface that you can do on the computer it's going to be top notch
not support for iphone xs max. i tried to use for invoice purpose but always pop out and can’t use
mr. brilliant app
. this apo no longer works. i cannot make invoices, sales receipts, etc. i called quickbooks and they said there is nothing they could do. i have a mobile business and relied on this app, now it's useless.
. good app for accounting
business. great app
would have given 5 stars. i love the application. i would have given five stars if it allowed entering of vendor bills. it only allows expenses to be added.
doesn't work!. it hardly used to work, now it doesn't work at all. my boss is constantly on me for missing invoices, well i can't make them because the app doesn't work! crashes immediately when i try to open it. when it does open, it will let me sign in then give me an error.
. love the website! app could be made a bit better. and there is no discount column in invoices. please add discount!
". loving being able to access and invoice on the go! can be slow but so can online. entering invoices on phone i have to hide the keyboard to go to next field  be good to have ""next"" button."
organization. finally found a way to do things faster and keep me organized!! with qb app i can easily go into my account and make an invoice, pay a bill, and add my deposits as soon as i do them without waiting until i'm in my office to do everything.
receipt camera. the camera update has made what was a relatively easy task into a complete guessing game
app is almost useless for me.. the only reason i upgraded to quickbooks on line was so that i could do estimates and invoicing on site. this app will allow me to do an estimate but will not let me do a partial invoice. if i can’t do a partial invoice on the app it’s simply a waste of time for my small fencing business.
. superb just need to upgrade to a better version..
. great app for individual
qbo is essential. i have my own consulting company and qbo makes running my business much more efficient. even an accountant client agrees. one of the best features is the expense recording. at a business lunch, i'll take a pic of the receipt, record the transaction and that's it. don't have to think about it again. i couldn't function without qbo!
. makes my job sooooo,much easier
does not work after update. tech support recommended i get a android. claims apple is the problem.
owner of superior insulation. love this app its great
easy to use. great app! gives me most things i need to know on the go. however, i wish it would show me revenueexpense charts.
desperate for mobile. same as when i tried it in 2012. devoted qb online user, but this app is useless to me. this app may help sales people, but does nothing for management. no banking, no reporting, no transactions.
. can do a lot quickly. like most apps doesn't allow you to do everything you can do on full site. great for adding invoices on the go.
good app. good app, lacking functionality but this will improve in time.
. not for me and now i can't unsubscribe or delete account please delete account i don't want it and your unsubscribe tool does not work.
junk update = worthless app. since the latest update, my qb app shows an error saying that my session has expired immediately after i log in. i can't use it at all. pc access is okay.
. i use this app for my pest control business. it has some ups and downs but overall it's easy to use and a great product at a great price.
limited features in the app. the app has extremely limited features as compared to web cant send customer statements or edit recurring transactions or match partially paid invoices.
what the crap?. great, now i won't be able to use qb on my iphone. guess i'll have to carry my laptop with me everywhere ughhhhhh. is this because i'm on 32bit iphone 5? i refuse to upgrade, please make it work again!!! 😫🐳
keshav. it is a beautiful software. very flexible and user friendly. it made my work so simple. thanks to quick books!
won’t interface to bank any more. after several months since my bank kicked qb out of accessing my bank account for reconciling, the problem still remains. accessing my bank account and reconciling all transactions over my iphone was my number one reason to use qb. still disappointed. i have to pay a bookkeeper to do my books with qb now. why can xero have bank access but qb can’t sort itself out after several months !
better improvement. app running better
. easy to use with a clear overview of your business expenses
. very easy to use. let's me print legal invoices on the go. can also provide quotes and estimates.
app shows incorrect transactions. transactions do not match the selected vendor. works when you have few transactions. once you pass 20k it becomes slow and inaccurate.
"missing a couple things. would be even better if the mobile app allowed you to enter the ""ship time"" and ""ship date"" and if the ""reports"" could be viewed on the app could be more full service"
a pretty good app. update: they added deposits! it does everything i need now, upgrading to 5 star! all in all, this is a pretty great app. it does just about everything i need it to while on the go, but it is missing one key piece of functionality. it does not allow the recording of deposits and that is really important for me. other than that it functions flawlessly and has never given me any trouble. overall, i love it!
. love this app. just wish i could create work orders
crashing. since moving to iphone11 pro  the app keeps crashing. can’t even access it! please fix this as i have to upload receipts to my laptop to add to quickbooks! ain’t nobody got time for that........

. bank feeds never update. been telling me to check back in a couple of hours for 3 days. resync doesn't work. completely useless without updated banking information. uninstalling and never returning. stick to the web browser bc this app is a waste of my time and space!
onion vs. desktop. i have just purchased the desktop version. i would.like to use the app to record my expenses on the fly. from what i can tell you need to have an online account to do so. please help if there is a way.
. better program than the internet site on my mac book pro! very easy to use and very seem less operation.
offline mode. i wish i could enter transactions without an internet connection. then they would synch after the device reconnects.
. this app is now horrible, it was great up until latest update and now i am unable to run my business using this app. very frustrating when an app takes steps backwards please help????
does the job. very effective app to make small business owners productive.
. great app! it makes doing my small business easier!
. good app wish it had a feature to scan in receipts otherwise it has been super helpful
missing functions. great app for its current functions but it is missing functions such as entering bills while on the road. most of my purchases are on accounts so it leaves me doing my book work at home like the old systems. if this gets added i will stay a happy user if not back to one of the other competitors.
best business app. easily the best business purposed app.
great potential but.... the app has a great potential to replace the web version. however i do not understand why most of the features aren't in the app. i can't attach a pdf file to an invoice!! why? .. or i cant send an statement with the app.. why not ? .. why cant add company seal and stamp on the invoices ? ipad is a very capable device.. the app should bring all the features of the online version.
love this app!. very easy and simple to use. i can instantly add details from job to job and also great for keeping track of what's going on in my company. thanks jdm auto detailing
great app and fair prices. i do all my business through quick books and have had no major problems. the rates on credit transactions are equivalent to any other clearing house and at $30 a month to automate my process is a life saver. great simple to read reports too.
unhappy. bad program for ipad and android phone. bad customer service. very dissatisfied.
. luv how easy and convenient thus app is!
phone. phone app is better than pc version
great app but. we need to have the ability to track mileage within the online version. also need to be able to auto fill a lot of data over to turbotax and allow it to do personal property taxes. i think the cost of this service is high for compared to the desktop version of which you can do more with. please work on the updates and continue to offer a great product.
ideal for small business. very user friendly and i phone friendly too
demoted from 5 stars to 4. using the app on ipad and iphone for more than 5 years. dashboard has been unable to properly show invoice status for at least 3 months now. version 17.9, at least 3 updates ago? no fix yet nor response from intuit after feedback. while i’m not fond of frequent updates, one expects to have these kinds of obvious bugs fixed in the next update.
crashes. upgraded to ios 10, now app will no open.
. super userfriendly! very professional invoices. i love it.
. unable to edit or delete products on setup pretty disappointed couldnt load suppliers not an easyapp at all. plus the set tutorial is different to app presented for 10.95 a month
owner. grate easy to use set up and keep track of spending and overdue invoices
. just the request for this app. i want to use it in my mobile also.
terrible. what’s the point of this app, can’t even search employees. rubbish
. dashboard does not load. completely useless at this point. cannot invoice, add expenses or write sales receipts.
. excellent! this app gives me so much onthego functionality for running my business  it's perfect!
. this app doesn't allow me to add expenses. please fix it. thank you.
sweet. app is so easy and convenient! greatest thing about it is that it synchronizes with square so i don't have to worry about writing anything down anymore again. the snap is such a great convenience!
great app. does what exactly it has to do
. slow app but super useful
quickbooks. great app. excellent business account program to run my business from my iphone.
worked awesome until latest update. just says error every time i log in. worked great before update however.
checking the books on the go. great app to have on the run
great app if it worked.. this app was really promising at first, but now it seems like i consistently have issues with chase bank accounts and american express accounts updating. it’s monday and sine thursday my alchase accounts say they are updated when they are not and my amex continuously has error connections. and then u call customer service and they ask you if you called amex to see why there was a connection problem. a shame.
new receipt identification is much worse. the new version of the identification of receipts when taking a picture to upload to an expense is much much worse than the previous implementation. this version hasn’t worked accurately once in 30+ pictures, whereas the old version worked accurately 90%+ of the time. how does this stuff get through testing...? :
. error everytime i log in, and requires password so often. edit: the log in is working, but when i try to add an expense it doesn't save, the same button doesn't work
my experience. quickbooks is a system designed for people in business to streamline there activities. in doing so allowing their accounting processes to flow more effectively. quickbooks has changed my business dramatically. thank you
. this is not an free app. and they say it's not free after you submit all you information including phone number for verification. if they say its not free before i submit the info, i might think over and probably purchase....
works great. i just started using this for a small business and while i'm still figuring out a few of the functions for accounting, it's quite intuitive overall. it's a very useful piece of software.
. awesome app
worthless!. until this app can sync with the desktop version of quickbooks, it is worthless to my business. i'm sorry i downloaded it. but i have already deleted it.
great software. i have come to really like quick books online. quoting, invoicing, reports and my personal favourite... it links with your bank account to automate expense inputs. you set the rules once and the next time a similar transaction appears in your linked bank account it automatically categorises the transaction for you, just hit 'add'. saves me so much time and effort and to me it's fast becoming a business tool i simply wouldn't be without.
newest update issue. hi, i love this app and it normally works great. when i updated my ipad, i can no longer take payments because of a weird glitch that keeps the total amount $0 even if the item is $25. i emailed with screenshots. giving you a heads up to look for that. at the moment, i can’t process any payments. it’s frustrating! thank you.
disaster to sign out. i happened to see this app and found it is interesting to scan invoices but turns to be that i have to be a “company” to use it and have to pay so much for it! so expensive!!!!!!
fantastic qb's app. this app is great! works just as good, if not better, as the desktop version. to me it seems even more user friendly & it is just so convenient when on the go. definitely download! it works so well, i decided to pay the monthly fee to use it.
. purchased app following welcome link from qb online thinking they would integrate and work together seamless, not so totally separate and no vat invoicing. cancelled same day billed for a month.
not quite what i'm looking for. after the invoice2go update disaster, i read a lot of good things about this app. sadly it fell short of expectation as i was unable to change the invoice number, which i would think was a pretty basic requirement. advice on the internet seems to relate to an older version of the app as the information did not relate to what was on the screen. i won't be utilising my free trial, nor will i be subscribing.
. not able to switch between companies using app followed instructions from developer which did not exist in app. faq site link doesn't exist.
i need to actually work!. this would be an awesome app if i could do more than just send estimates and invoices. there are other tasks that need to be done and it would be really helpful if you could do everything that you can do online.
getting better but a long way left to go. we switched to quickbooks on the recommendation of a number of accountants. then we realized that quickbooks online and the desktop offering are worlds apart. the app is good, but not great. the entire qbo experience is frustrating and getting support is difficult.
. great app recommend it to anyone with a business
entering bills?????. why have intuit decided not to support bill entering on this app?!? it great i can import my paper receipts using the camera, but whats the point if i can't enter as a bill only an expense?!?
awesome app. it's a womderful app, so versatile and functional
does not do simple qb tasks. this app does not have all the functions as the computer online version. i can't run simple reports and the payroll app which is separate does not allow me to make changes to the employee information. doesn't function like you need it to and it put me in a bind when i went out of town with just my ipad. i would not even give it one star. worthless.
. very hard to work with didn't match up with my phone or my tablet.
starting with errors. i am just starting my beekeeping business and trying to track expenses. quick books somehow has me making a $164 sale. i can't erase it because it doesn't exist. would love it but can't reconcile the books if random numbers are calculated out of thin air!
. great app
. does some things great others not so much awefactor on some things... fail on others
critical update!. i was just in the middle of a really long material list and a notification came up that there were critical updates to the app. clicked on ok.... lost everything! not impressed. there was no option to ignore or update later. according to the app update description it was just minor bug fixes etc, etc.
would be great if…. this app would really be a great app if it woukd have all the functions as on the pc. for exsample i wanted to issue an invoice with a different currency, and the app blocked it and sent me to the pc. so for what is this app good if we have to go to the pc for almost each transaction?
small business owner. i have been skeptical about leaving all my business information in an external server, thinking that one day, the software seller is not longer in business. intuit has given me that confidence and now i am very excited with services i have received so far. the program is easy to set up and easy to use. very friendly menus. you can use as many functions you wish. is good even for those who have little experience keeping track of business.
. much easier than using the mobile site on my phone and very convenient for sending invoices
does not support multiple currencies. hope they can add multiple currencies soon. it's useless if you have a primary currency other than usd.
don't believe the negative reviews!!. i think the application is a huge time saver. works great on my ipad air 2. i strongly recommend this app! it's like getting a full time bookkeeper for only $30 per month! i like having my business records semiautomated in the cloud. intuit offers a 30 day trial. why not just try before you buy? that's what i did and i haven't been disappointed.
. quickbooks online has been great, downloaded this app to make life quicker when not in the office. however, for expenses i have found it unusable as the same payment methods i am using online are not available on the app and therefore it messes up the consistency of my transactions. very disappointed as had high hopes, have yet to test the differences whilst invoicing.
pretty but not functional. it's bizarre how the graphics continue to be improved but the functionality doesn't. i've been trying to use this app for years but the features i need on the go are missing such as timekeeping. mostly this app seems to work a lot like you would imagine quicken mobile to work, by being able to look up past banking transactions. but i can do that on my banking apps for free already.
superb!!!. this is a great app for keeping up to date with accounts. links to my bank accounts and intelligently matches transactions and remembers previous matches and entries. certainly deserves the name quickbooks based on how quickly i can enter my bank transactions. great for multiuser access and very easy to set up. overall this is much better than i expected.
don't bother. been using qb desktop for years. disapointed in the sasmobile version. mobile app is slow and frequently fails to load at all. not much functionality at all besides creating invoices. checking account balances or customer ar is not worth the bother on mobile app. this is an ok solution. i bet there are better options available than qb mobile app.
good program. does what it is suppose to do
excellent. does everything i need & it synchronizes with other apps i use.
decent app missing features. overall the app works good. i wish it had some of the website features such as the ability to post deposits considering depositing money is a mobile activity.
. best program and online service i have ever used.
. great app for the on the go contractor. i can invoice, send a receipt from anywhere.
love it. great app
qb makes me look good. qb app is fantastic. i can write and present an estimate right at the job site or give my customer an invoice, or accept payment. in brief....it makes me look good!
". the app will not sync to my quickbooks data. an error message appears. i am able to access my data online but not on the app. after 2 hrs on the phone with ""quickbooks"" i am left with ""we don't know"" and no solution in sight. i am a contractor and i use my phone or tablet to invoice etc. now i have all my accounting on quickbooks and can't use my phone or tablet to work it."
great product. i love using the cloud version of this software to make my business more streamlined
quickbooks. it's a great app.
shiny, pretty and useless. the shinier they make it, the more confusing and unfriendly it gets. no reminders, no scheduled transactions and no searchable help. i have the ipad app to make accounting quick and easy when i travel not to have something new to learn.
. great software i use it on my laptop, phone and tablet. easy to use very happy with product. would recommend to any business owner
. best app for accounting purpose
. this is a good app for my electrical business
. the worst!!!! i switched to a new phone and now it doesn't recognize my user name and password. it even allowed me to change the password and then wouldn't recognize the new one. called twice to resolve the problem. first time, 35 minute wait and hung up. 2nd time 40 minute wait, hung up. i will be canceling my subscription and looking for a quality competitor who values customer service. what a shame!
great apps. like it!
new update. i love the app and it has been great for us for years. however, the new update does not allow a custom date range for reports and when you edit an invoice it gives you a small screen that not everything fits on. please bring back the custom date range and make is so we can see everything on edits.
. easy to use great app
"cool expenses feature allows upload of receipt  needs croppdf tool. one of the best parts of the app is the ""expenses"" feature, which allows you to enter all of the details of an expense on the go, including the expense account, how you paid (credit card, etc), and any memodescription of the transaction. i'd like to see the image upload function in expense allow for cropping, and even better, auto pdf conversion with cropping, like the camscanner app"
awesome. such a great package. it made my life so easy with the phone app that i can raise invoices and quotes on the go. it also makes your business look heaps bigger and professional by having proper invoicing that allows taking signature on quotes too. loving it.
. needs to be better i use desktop version for my small business. desktop version is great but i refuse to use mobile. freezes every time i click something, selecting store location is unavailable. its a shame such a good program is way behind on mobile capabilities. please make mobile like desktop
. love it. does all i need for now
forced payroll system not working. since march 2017 our payroll that they force you to pay for if you have employees has not working correctly. edd efile is non existent, cannot archive reports, and irs efile is sporadic. customer service wont credit any amount nor can they fix the problem even after “escalating” it to priority customer support. three “cases” opened, none of which fixed the problem. do not buy this product.
great app. app is great and worked well with my iphone x but just updated to iphone 11 pro mac and app will not open crashes and closes every time please fix
won't open. i use this app daily and now it won't open! please fix this!
. cannot login. uninstalled and now cannot reinstall
"keep getting ""session expired"" message with every log in attempt. completely makes the app nonfunctional for on the go business. critical flaw! please fix it!! oh, and the link for support is dead... come on folks, gimme a chance here!!"
poor payroll and after service tech support.. been waiting months to try and sort it out. hours on the phone. not worth the energy anymore. looking at zero as a worthwhile option. regret being tricked into the cheap price. pay peanuts you get monkeys.
. it's a great app
can't sync. can't upload data from my desktop to qb online. i have qb pro 2009. is it not compatible?
great program. i use this for my landscaping and it has been better every year
so easy!. this made things so much easier. my clients are happy with the line itemization. detailed descriptions. doesn't get much better than this.
excellent program. i am so impressed with this new app, it is very easy to use and very helpful for my construction business. i don't even have to go to the office to make an invoice i can do it right in my truck on my phone and send it. i can check on expenses... it's a breeze and worth the time to get to know this app and online program.
. errors on free trail. can generate a invoice or put the company name on. i try my phone, tablet and laptop. keep on saying the same thing. error on tax .........
app not working on iphone. i’ve been trying to install the app on my iphone (6s) with the current version of ios for the past couple of months. the app downloads and installs. when i tap the app to open it, the screen briefly shows the intuit quickbooks logo and then closes. i called support but the told me to go to apple. the ability to use the app to capture receipts etc was a big draw to using quickbooks online. very disappointed.
boost to my business image with my ipad!. i went from handwriting every estimate, sales receipt and invoice to bringing in new paperless technology. at the end of the day i would have to have my wife input everything in our quick books online. then file everything in our office. it's not only impressive to our clients, but it also eliminates filing and an extra step of data entry, it saves time and money and gives you a competitive edge over your competition!
downloads. automatic downloads have been taken away, you now have to go through the print page to save as pdf, then name the file and save from there. where as it used to automatically save and download with its own name. this app is getting worse.
quickbooks makes it easy. quickbooks is one of the biggest reasons my company has hit tremendous growth. online invoices and payments makes my job literally a thousand times easier.
. this is a great app for my small business and has helped me to stay organized and saves time!
ok... like seriously. i’ve used this app for 2019 mileage and expense tracking. but every week i have to reconnect my bank account. like every single week! why?? i don’t have time to do that. fix this! or i’ll be forced to find a better working service!
. absolutly a must have for any biz owner. really an easy & amazing app. takes your company to the next level with ease.
new update changed invoices. the app shuts down every time i get a signature!!
needs improvement. i love the desktop version but my app version and even the online version never works right! there is always something that doesn't work. i always go through the whole estimate or invoice and then it won't save it for me! very frustrating and i wish they could work out all of the kinks.
. your mobile app crashed since 2508. unable to launch until today. app is still not working perfectly. unable to edit details especially product and service. keep suggesting to contact support but app complete freeze when i tapped on support.
easy invoices. although some setups require a full web browser this app is great for new companies setup and invoicing.
. i would like to use on my laptop and can not, it won't let me use it here, only on my phone or tablet where i originally signed up for use. i can't do all that work from my phone and i don't want to. if i can't use on my laptop, i will have to cancel my subscription
great app!. very useful and convenient app.
great app. dan
great app so far. great app. one thing needed i’d making it easier to change customers info when doing a new invoice for a previous customer but at a new address.
quickbooks a real sage beater!. having been a sage customer for over 15 years i wish i had discovered quick books sooner, why did i spend all that money on yearly updates when i didn’t need too. i absolutely would recommend quickbooks to everyone and i do! thanks for a great product guys 👍🏻
one thing. i give it four stars cause i cant figure out how to keep it completely updated and current, i have qb on my computer and i have information on there that does not show up on the app, but overall its perfect.
easy. useful
sales tax calculation is wrong. when creating an invoice, the app does not honor customer's sales tax setting. it applies tax even on customers with tax turned off. please fix asap!!!!
excellent for businesses in the go!. quickbooks is easy to use and the app allows me to create transactions, view balances and customer information wherever i am. i also love that i can take a photo of a receipt and categorize it on the go.
. this app is rubbish. it doesn't do the single thing you'd think was necessary using phone camera to take photo of receipt to attach to transaction.
pathetic. a company like intuit making such lousy app... unbelievable! 😠
fantastic app for a superb product!!. i've been using quickbooks since i began my private voice and piano studio. i am able to easily track invoices and payments and send reminders to my students and their parents. the app has helped me save time when adding payments so i can focus my time on my students. i also love how i can send receipts and reminder invoices even when i am on the run! definitely a 5 star product & app!
. good and easy to use great app
keep getting stuck. this is the first time i am using this app and in keep getting stuck after every two, three transactions
"qbo is getting better. after learning qbo and using it for the past 2 years, i can say it is slowly improving as a software. it infuriated me in the beginning. and it still can be cantankerous at times. it is also not as robust as the desktop qbs. but it has slowly gotten better. now i kind of ""get"" qbo and find it useful. please continue to improve it."
down fall in quality. not a quality app. the screen is difficult to maneuver around in. there's no back or close.
horrible app. you can’t add time activity. this has to be the stupidest design i’ve ever seen. you’re in the field and the most common use would be to add billable time. i’m about to switch to another provided if they don’t get their act together.
going okay. i’m happy so far. love the bank link up, did four months of data entry in two hours i sent my first quote. i’m using an iphone 8 plus and will use as customer interface which i look for to when i get printer.. however i note that i will have to log on via a pc the set some things up as i don’t get that option on the app. love the finger i’d sign in
". was great, while it worked. like the previous review, on a galaxy s9 i just get a blank dashboard and cannot enter new expenses. so the product has no use. not very impressed with qb's ""we're working on it"" response. this should have been basic testing done by the team, not by paying customers."
. very slow on mobile
app doesn't show anything. the app version does not match the online quickbooks. most of the information is not accessible in the app.
love new layout. love this app it allows me to create invoices and receipt on the go with tablet or phone
excellent app. keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
expected better.. for quickbooks having been the leader for so long in small business accounting software, i expected more from their online format and their app. while it is great for quick, on the go stuff, you can't add accounts in the app. you have to log into the web version for that. overall, i expected more and felt i stepped backwards in using online from the desktop platform i had used for years.
. like the app. interface is great. would like to see an charge option for customers, so i can tally up customer's account over the course of a month and bill at the end for my lawn care business.
been asking for a simple feature for years.. still to this day i’m amazed i cannot do the most important task on the mobile app. if i’ve created an expense via my desktop. i have no way of viewing it or editing it on the mobile version. it’s totally un integrated.
not happy. when i first got the app i fell in love i had problems with the desktop version , with the bank option on the online version which you removed i was able to log in my transactions very quickly , i would appreciate it if you would please bring back the bank option in the menu asap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
. great app
. problems sending invoices. update to customers from ipad doesn't always work. other issues. still a good app.
awesome product for small business!!. unbelievably convenient! from my imac, to my tablet, to my phone i can access, enter payment, send an estimate, or invoice, etc and it’s all connected because i have online quickbooks. hint: go they intuit directly! itunes was charging me an extra $5 a month. $19.99 a month they intuit and worth every penny!! biggest time saver + unsurpassed professionalism to my customers and speed of connectivity!!
excellent app. i cannot tell you how much time i'm saving now. i wish i had changed to online years ago.
. fantastic, easy to use software. i own two small businesses and quickbooks has made my life a lot easier. with the app i can use it anywhere, which is a nice bonus. highly recommend it!
crashes. this app fails all the time, i keep having to reinstall to log in.
doesn’t load (for me). app doesn’t load. tap on the icon and nothing happens. i hope no one else has this problem.
. easy to use. make business life easier
. very handy.
it's not signing in. it says error all the time... pls help me on this
"soooo slow. i have been using this app for about three years , and it was very functional and useful, but now, almost every time i open it, it says ""downloading data,"" and stays there... for 35 minutes doesnt matter whether my phone is on wifi or cell coverage. i hope they fix this bug."
don't do it. can't bill a portion of a estimate have to bill it all at once! it will not let you see your job costs per estimate! this is a huge deal i can't believe they haven't fixed this yet. come on qb add another freaken column already! tones of other stuff on the accounting side that i don't know about is missing as well!
easy to use on the go!. super convenient way to keep up with your accounting and invoices from anywhere on the go.
awesome interface. awesome app. that's what it says it will do. the only problem is when i log an expense it attaches receipts as images and not as pdfs. also i do not like the image scanner it doesn't trim around the edges of the receipt. i end up having to use a pdf scanner and then attach the receipt in quickbooks online in a browser.
qb online. personal accounting made easier
. it's been awesome giving estimate 's on the fly.
lies. says free, makes you sign up for an account saying try it free, and then says you don't have a subscription and closes. bullshit app. deleted.
". i like it better then sage. seems easy enough for what i am looking for. yes it is ""online"" so you need internet connection but it makes for seemless connection between phone and computer. had a few questions and support was great and got back to me same day both times."
. really quick and simple set up. easy to use. no problems so far. perfect for a small business.
. functional app that is working for me, customization could be better.
awesome app. i was hesitant going to the monthly subscription, but it has been awesome always having access to my business account. the app looks and works just like the desktop app on my mac.
very disappointing. very limited subset of the online product. the fact that i can't see all my normal reports makes no sense. and can't log in through the browser, so ipad is pretty useless tool for quickbooks. funny thing is that there is beta version for iphone that is more functional. wish it worked on ipad.
simply, beautifully... brilliant. i've no need to log in via the laptop until the end of the month... the fact that i can capture, create but also review my expenses, my p&l and notes is simply brilliant.
great program. i love quickbooks. i run payroll and create estimates, invoices and sales receipts. i am able to link all my accounts even my square account easily and seamlessly. the customer service representatives are competent and friendly.
invoice reminder from app. i was hoping to manage my quickbooks account on my ipad like how i use qkb on a laptop, but it seems like on the ipad version it’s missing a lot functionalities, such as invoice reminder to client. also to set up the invoice reminder. can you please improve this in your next update? thanks.
. very logical and functional software,.
it's a great app.. good to create invoices on the run, and keep track of your business. my only complaint is that there is no place to put in a po or job name. i would also like if customers could sign with a stylist or finger on a touch screen phone. i have a samsung note 3 and would like to see that option. but still a good app.
bookkeeper 60. excellent app. would be 5 stars but still has bugs...most notably touch id login.
. great. great app. makes life easier.
great app. can do so much on the app. would be even better if could prepare bills in the app.
. 'quick' and easy to use on the go, great app
. looking for an update to more easily track hours per job.
top notch app for businesses. makes it so easy to run my business on the go!!!!
great for business on the move. this app is a solid connection to your quickbooks and allows for quick and straightforward posting of expenses, invoices and estimates.
simplicity and ease. i am new to quickbooks online but absolutely love how simple the app is. it creates time and space in my personal life.
love. so helpful first time business owner. learning as i go.. this app. has helped me so much
great on the go!. not as detailed as i would like but does the job!
i love it easy to use !!!!. easy to use and easy to navigate!!!
excellent. great mobile app from intuit, quickbooks online is great and although a bit different from the desktop version it has improved the way i work with my clients
. would be better if it used ai to fill in some of the receipt details
it just works. it works well across all platforms. laptop pc, ipad, android phone. i am very pleased with it. still so much that i need to learn as i don't know much about business.
it's scam don't download 19.99 per month they took from my account. i just did download almost 8 month ago this app they took from my account almost 19.99 per month after cancel also they are robbing very bad don't download at all even no customer service to help you to talk also bad bad super bad
jireh landscaping. great!! great program and app!!
. keeps closing and telling me to report an error but closies before i can click on the link to repoet the error!
too many error messages. for what you pay for a quickbooks online account, this app for ipad and iphone is really disappointing. i get an error message almost every single time i try and enter a new transaction. sometimes it works despite the error message, sometimes it doesn't. but i get the error every time. i can't even access the banking functions as i get an error message and nothing will load. the only function that seems to work properly is the reports section.
"love this app. it is so awesome to be able to login to our accounting software and services do an invoice right from the service location we just finished up on... i can actually send a store manager a estimate sheet as a ""what was done  sign off sheet for his record in the case of a corporate billing. i am so glad i chose qb's online..."
room for improvement. it is a great app. it has a lot of room for improvement. i need to be able to assign each expense to individual jobs so i can job cost. also i need to be able to create multiple jobs per customer, ie sub jobs.
. great app for small business.
need this feature too!!!!. if an invoice is send it is send along with the intuit notification. as i am using a purchased version i need the invoice to be send completely under my company designations. apart from that drawback everything else is fine.
great app on the go. view invoices ,do invoices and bids on the go no need to wait until you get to your laptop or computer
better than before. i like the ability to record expenses on the fly and take a picture of the receipt. would be better if the smart logic time saving features in quickbooks online were incorporated.
keeps getting better. i've had this app since its first release. i can finally rely on the phone  ipad app without needing to boot up my computer  including accurate profit and loss accounts and easy invoicing. the new bank reconciliation for the app works perfectly and is a very welcome addition for my business. i look forward to international currencies being supported in a future release.
. love the app! easily work from anywhere!!
great app. i've started using quick books as i switched from kashflow it's much easier and has a great user interface.
work in progress, work not yet completed. very convenient and functional tomorrow to add expenses and receipts on the go. however only expenses not bills or other random transactions can be accessed through the mobile app. hoping intuit sees the feedback and that all transactions available including bills to be accessed on the mobile app. please add bills to the mobile apps.
cornered into online version. not an easy transition from desktop for contractor version. poor interface for entering time to bill for. hard to tell what time and materials i have not billed for. mobile interface is fairly limited.
awesome. i'm a carpenter. this app changed my life, and actually gave me back a lot of my life. estimates done before you leave your customers house? how cool is that.
. great software . still learning.
ios 13 crashing. app crashing after password screen , ios 13 is not compatible with this app at present , considering the amount my company pays for quickbooks i’m disappointed to say the least .
. it's a great app for any business. easy to use and your data could be accessed any where you are.
luv it!. have been using quickbooks for many many years. have loved it from the beginning. i am now enjoying the online version even more. has been a wonderful addition for me and all of my clients. has made travel so much easier for my clients to still be able to keep tabs on their businesses. strongly recommend!
. great so far. how do i upgrade my subscription to essentials?
are you kidding me?. do i really have to download my company data every time i write an invoice or add an expense?! i have a feeling you are going to lose a lot of customers if you don't change it back to how it used to work. very dissatisfied with how long it takes to download company data.
is an average app. is a good app but with all these update is confusing my customers and sometimes they can't pay online. i can't access it from my phone sometime. it's in and off so be warned and be patient. this is an important tool for my business.
. pretty good app.
. app is pretty much useless. pointless to have an app when i have to enter my transactions on a desktop anyway. i want general journal entries in the app (or ya know, a better way to enter my daily sales info) or my damn money back!
qb makes me look good. qb app is fantastic. i can write and present an estimate right at the job site or give my customer an invoice, or accept payment. in brief....it makes me look good!
. this app is not syncing my data from last 15 days. even support team is not responding with resoultion
perfect for construction guys. i'm always running from job to job and the mobility to give estimates and invoice is on the spot is priceless... plus the customizable terms for each buildercustomer with the added alerts helps me stay on top of receivables
overall good product. not having access to the entire online tools on the app makes for complicated tasks at times. the online browser does not run fluently with a safari browser so if i need anything beyond basics i need to get to a pc.
have been waiting to get this app. awesome!. great app! easy to use. wish i can take payments from this app.
can't log in. ami the only one ho just can't log in? customer support unreachable.
. works great and any issues have been worked out mostly. i do wish i could see all my customer history though!!!!!!!
great accounting app. so far i like it. pretty much easy to use
loopy. i tie to sign in and it returns me to sign in again. i even reset my password still doesn't work. it loops back ! crap
owner light it up. cannot login iphone 6s qb update will not download properly can't get into customer information what the cuss😡😡
. it is a huge mental relief to have this app acting as a virtual accountant for me and i am not drowning in papers. much love!
. not so great. have two businesses and the app mixes and misses my customers
business owner. could use more features and customization on forms and invoices. some basic functions are missing. otherwise helpful. would recommend for a small business.
keep crashing. after last update keep crashing. new update came just an hour ago still same crash???!!!doesn’t launch the app. please fix asap pleasseeee
🎼love it!!!🎉. we have a construction company, quick books online is a dream come true for us. we can present a client with a proposal at the time of the estimate, get a signature, a deposit, get the job started right away. thank you quick books. 🤓
exactly as described. it does what it is supposed to. i am a longtime user of the desktop version and still do, however for a fledgling small business that is mobile the online version is incredibly convenient.
good app!. add travel tracking to app
bank transactions not loaded. there are several limitations with this app. but my major issue is the inability to load bank transactions. the connected bank account goes sometimes for weeks or months without the transactions transferred to qb. other times they are uploaded every couple of days. there is no option to upload the transactions manually through the app. i called customer service but no one helped. this makes the phone app pretty much useless.
great app. very easy to use voice to text is amazing can't believe i hadn't done this sooner.
like the app. just hope it would be easier to use need better access to my custumers invoice and estimates
outstanding. i love the new quickbooks app it allows me to invoice and estimate my customers in a snap it also allows me to bring the point of sale in the home credit card processing is very easy also my favorite feature is that i am able to transfer my contacts into my quickbooks customer list with the press of a button
makes my work easier and faster. this apps worth every dollar i paid for.. it makes everything easier and faster
worst “upgrade” process ever!!!!. if you have self employed don’t even dream of trying to fluidly upgrade to online. they data doesn’t just migrate over. the tech support people are clueless. one sharing my screen hadn’t ever even seen what self employed looked like and had no idea how anything worked compared to online. it’s total frustration.
business development manager at play now enterprise llc,. it works great for me. quick books has amazing customers service. what i love the most is their customers services.
qb app is useless. i’ve been quickbooks user for a long time and discovered this app gives a totally different set of numbers than quickbooks online does. expenses are different than real version so please beware, you can’t trust the numbers. contacted support to no avail. i guess they don’t read the other reviews either.
recent update. crashes frequently! if editing an estimate or invoice on ipad it opens in a floating window that can slide down into the abyss and all progress is lost! very unhappy with the latest update!
best business app. quickbooks has definitely made running my business much more efficient and has made it easier to close on deals. the estimate tool makes it easy to send professional looking estimates to clients, and with a click, those estimates turn into invoices. you can receive payments through quickbooks as well. add the payroll service and you can run the whole business yourself. i would definitely recommend this to any new business start up.
very nice!!. have been using this app and computer software for 2 years now. very easy to use, have had no errors or screw ups with the app. it's great to link bank accounts to app for instant payments from invoiced. it's helped me with my business and accounting dramatically
love it and support intuit provides. very convenient app for expensing. had an issue crashing while logging in and customer support was very quick to respond.
update asap. i’ve been trying to use the app for a couple weeks now, and it keeps kicking me out. it’s very annoying!
. doesn't seem to let me login with my google account as i do on the website. not sure how i should login in this case.
poor. if you write a review and the nickname is taken you have to start all over again. app is very limited and web version has problems with ipad pro
great app. i run a it buisness. have loved using this app. i love being able to do invoices while i'm away from my computer.
. it makes invoicing easier
not for indian. please do remember this app is not useful for indian currency so don't waste your data.
zero stars. another worthless update. now you have to login every freakin time i set my phone down and of course invoicing a customer with a credit still doesn't synchronize correctly and has never. if you're looking for an accounting system please shop around before getting tangled up in this company. i've been waiting for that call from tech support for 5 years lololol. why do you keep trying to fix what isn't broken.
great app for the ipad. great app for the ipad and small buisness
very easy to use. makes dealing with finances very straightforward even on the road. great interface and reports. recommended!
. login issue verification code sending is very slow and sometimes not.
. great app
i love this app. this is the easiest to use and simplest way to use it.
quicken & quickbooks been around since the 80's. fantastic accounting software. great for anyone to use. teach your kids!😄😍😘💖💎💎💎
worthless. qbo is great, but this mobile app stinks.. worthless. hopefully they can evolve this app quickly. qbo is great but this app ain't
. app is constantly crashing.
quickbooks is good but…. slight learning curve and seems to have a few annoying bugsquirks.
waiting for updates. quite frankly, it's been totally useless. the app does not sync new data entries with the online database. i've already spent well over three hours with multiple customer support reps. the idea of creating invoices is great....only problem....it does not work!!!
. fantastic. best app ever
great applimited function. it is a great app. wish it had full functionality. payroll within the app. not a extra app. that only works. if you want ituit to handle everything. need to work like accessing from desktop. writing checks should also be there. plus running reports. but it is a great app. with limited function. has gotten better. just wish it was getting there faster.
best app. will recommend for everyone
. user friendly, good customer service.
professional and practical. love this app! makes my business paperwork so much easier!
. great app. i have had excellent customer service experiences.
down graded. from april this app is unusable. i down graded to qb online. it appears it was released about a year too soon. nothing but frustration from day one. the phone app is all but useless.
i wanted to like it. but..... i didn’t appreciate the daily phone calls asking if i needed help .... i just wanted an app that would let me do my own thing and not feel harassed
sales manager. love this app very easy to use has all i need to conduct business on a dayli basis
easy to use and quick customer service. love this app for my business. makes it easy to keep everything up to date and keeps the books accurate. i recommend it to every business!!
. love this app!
. great app
less than worthless to me. who cares what customers are near me! i want to see banking information, view various account in qb, do real work on my ipad. i should be able to do anything on this i can do using qq online. should is the operative word here. don't waste your time and space on your ipad.
absolutely wonderful.. very user friendly. no comparison to desktop version.
just what i needed. i run a small contractor business doing remodel work. the mobile app has been a godsend. i can track all my estimates, invoices & expenses in one place. helps me track clients that are late payers too (which sometimes happens). i like it. 100% worth the subscription
. currently unable to use. logging in on a huawei tablet the app crashes whenever i click on the banking tab as accountant login
sales tax. cannot use the app on my phone because it does not calculate sales tax correctly. spoke with customer service. they know the issue and do not seem to think it’s important to fix it. makes the app almost useless to me
. awesome app. very handy very easy to use. highly recommended!.
no more receipts in my pocket. shoot the receipt and record the transaction, now even more quickly with touchid
"send payment receipt function missing. i click ""payment"" to accept money from customer. but it don't have send payment receipt function in my android app, which this function available in browser version."
. app still sucks. just had to uninstall and reinstall again. happens about every 4 months.
waste of time. i paid for the app to get the discount, spent an afternoon inputting information and suddenly it wouldn’t save anything. logged out, rebooted, problem still existed. uninstalled app. on reinstall, the system didn’t recognize my login and i couldn’t access any of the work i input. apple has my $$$ though!
one man show. this app helps tons: estimate and invoice from anywhere.
. would be even more great if you could send your invoice with whattsapp
. does what it says. i'd recommend booking some hours with a qb approved accountant to get it set up right, once you've got it set up it takes care of itself. quality.
awesome app. quick books is really an awesome app. links up to accounts quickbooks payments. i can access from all my devices. it’s really versatile. you can make great estimates as well. emailed invoices and estimates look very professional.
. can't get any email response from quickbooks. bad customer service. i want to download my account transactions but no reply from quickbooks.
love it. very useful
the convenience of this service is worth every penny. without this app, i would often forget to log in after a job and record my time on an invoice. now, i can record billable time, field notes and expenses as i perform them, and email the bill to my customer upon my departure. the only thing i would like to see added is a way to record mileage as miles.
o melhor!. excelente!!! minha ferramenta de gestão financeira.
need more work. it’s ok for beginners they still need to improve it
owner small massage therapy business. for the small amount of paperwork my business requires, this app is perfect. i can input info before leaving the office and it prompts me with appropriate questions to categorize items properly. very user friendly and convenient.
user friendly. easy to use!
. i love this app easy to track expenses.
awesome app. love it
. where do i start. purchased to help with accounts for small self employment business. did not upload new transactions from bank account or paypal as advertised on app or the full site. mileage tracker was not accurate. user interface too basic. so frustrating as i would use this constantly but as it does not upload my transactions properly, it is unusable. far too glitchey as an app. wish i had done free trial and not wasted money on it.
. see once after putting password and user i'd could not able to login it's coming error
no pdf attachment. 3 stars as the app only able to upload photo of the invoice, not other format. you need to understand that pdf is much small in size and more practical for mobile upload. as for photo, it is at least 3m nowadays and it took almost 1 min or 2 to finish the upload.please look into it in next upgrade
nice app that works well!!. works well, well thought out and presented. helps me day to day for sure!!
fantastic. easy to use on all my mobile devices. makes small business operations much easier when you cannot afford office staff.
great app. love using qb vs the other one i was using. well worth the money imo.
good app. very detailed , im no pro @ accounting but i am teaching myself this app. its very in depth and i like it.
doesn’t always work. says it can’t show details on invoices. annoying.
. perfect to make invoices on the road however missing important functions like sending customer 'statements.
small business. this make life easier for my small business. i wish i found out about it sooner. we use it on a daily basis and love how easy it is to use
seems great so far. this is what i've been waiting for so i can invoice my jobs right on the spot. a few months on and yup this app is amazing works perfectly for what i need.
much room for improvement. if it were free, it's a great product , but as a paid program and app, it could use a good deal of user input towards improvement
. doesn't connect to all bank accouns. some of us don't have the opportunity of the standard high street back account due to various issues in our pasts. i have tried to connect a cashplus business account and it isn't supported.
app doesn’t recognize credentials. this app worked well for me until the most recent update. now i cant login, says can’t find the account with this emailpassword. this is very annoying since i travel frequently without a laptop. now i’ve lost the ability to access my accounts via the app.
what a joke.. can't add notes to customers. buggy! cant print. awful. if you are moving from qb desktop, think again! there's not even an easy way to just view today's business. no reports in app. useless.
. useful. allows invoicing, and updates on the go!
. they want nothing more than taking your money! wouldn't refund a $10 purchase when they couldn't transfer my subscription to the correct company file. i had a duplicate company file setup during my online migration, which according to support happens often.
. great app
. mindful movers uses quickbooks. very simple.
owner. love the program i am having problems inputing my desktop customers and previous business information. called the help desk and still waiting forba fix
"locks, freezes, and won't sync. updated last week and haven't been able to use it since. i've reinstalled, cleared cache, resynced data... nothing. qb customer service ""can't see any issues with my login"" so who knows ? ive been reduced to entering all my invoices from my computer at home (defeats the purpose of the app doesn't it?). until they fix this update, don't download it."
. great app
makes my life easier!. keep it up
. love this app for it's ability to let me keep track of my job expenses and billing amounts. i will certainly recommend this app for my colleagues.
awesome app. this app really helps me keep track of all my transactions for my pool business. easy to use and has everything i need.
zero stars 10.3 is junk. i used this app several times a day. i run my business on this app. since april 10th i cannot access my data. my business is suffering and intuit cannot fix it. i still have to pay. tech support at intuit  quickbooks recommended i switch to a android. (i doesn't work on my iphone or ipad) i really do not want to invest in new hardware. stay away from intuit they do not care and offer no solutions.
capturing expenses? approving transactions?. really nothing no support for the consultant on the go? why can't i shoot a picture of a receipt put a dollar value a catagory and a note and have it either for review or added to my expenses. what about my transaction list i can't see the same information from the full website here at all. throw us a bone man....
functional. easy. efficient. beautiful.. what more can i say? i am an independent film producer that is often out of the office. i prefer this app to the web version on my laptop. wow! this app alone makes the purchase of my iphone 7plus worth every dime.
. absolutely the worst. they cost us $3,450 that a customer sent to us as a payment. they held the money from us and them. an the rep was so happy, they even closed down our account. sad
love it!. so simple to use… i absolutely love this app!
. i am really thankful for this opportunity. this app vary great easily to use with simple and useful. thanks
what a joke. i am not a software developer and who ever designed this joke is not one either
good, but.... we've been using quickbooks online since we started our small business, and we like it because it's easy to use and travels with you. that being said, however, you can't back up the data to your own computer. so if you make a major mistake, you can't go backwards  only reset the books. so if you choose cbo, make sure you print backup trial balances constantly!
nice app!. i live on my device  from research to book keeping. elegant style and useful! i can do almost everything from my note 2! light years beyond the old quick books that i used 10 years ago! i'm sending invoices in minutes. awesome! update: still a great app on my nexus 6!
must have !!!. if you have a business that serves customers and you want to collect payment at time of service or later, you want this software along with its phone apps to do business in the field. your a fool if you don't !!!!
talkatone. i love this app.
"so frustrating. ""updated"" the app... telling me now that i need a new version of the app and since i already have it, not sure what i'm supposed to do. even my accountant agrees quickbooks online is too confusing. waiting for 2016 to close out my books and use a new program."
"worse accounting program. you have to go through multiple screens for a simple tasks. there is functionality in the app that's not available in the desktop which is unusual for an accounting program. automation and ""how to"" help menus are nearly nonexistent."
at $12.99 month not free (false advertising). imagine my surprise, i trusted qbooks desktop to run my company, not sure i can trust some goof advertising free app and not letting you see anything unless you sign the free trial then $12.99month
how did they not see this coming?. quickbooks is currently not working on any update from apple. doesn't work in ios 10, doesn't work on safari 10 on the mac, can't download the mac app! business has been crippled for days. a business app like this needs far better reliability!
loved the app until banking disappeared. i mainly use my computer to do most of our accounting but loved having the app so i could accept banking transactions during short periods of downtime thereby keeping our bank balance up to date all the time. then today i went to catch up on accepting transactions and banking has totally disappeared from the menu. help! what happened? i deleted and reinstalled the app to no avail.
so helpful. my business is basically my husband and me. when we are both out of the office, it's been difficult to have to wait to help customers. this app has allowed me to to create an invoice from an estimate, accept payment and send a receipt all from the truck!
“updates”. every time i go to do something the app says it has to log me out to run updates. getting sick of typing my password constantly. (literally 100% of the time i try and use the app.) pretty much just use the website these days.
very nice!. i love have this power in my phone! i can email invoices or print them out, all on my phone! this app is easy to learn and soooooo fast when you get used to it. there was a lot of thinking when they designed this app, wow
lot of scope for improvement. finding a lot difficult to access even the simple features like search etc. hopefully the updates will take care of it.
subscription bug driving me crazy!. for the last few weeks the quickbooks app has been unusable! it alerts me that my subscription has expired and will lock me out of any activities. i have been on the phone with tech support, my subscription is up to date, it gets fixed for a day and then the problem re emerges the next day. this is an excellent app when this problem does not exist. i use a fully updated ipad pro. please fix this bug!
besi. it just makes life easier awesome app
error. the app is not letting me sign in! it keeps saying error!
great tool. a great app for invoicing on the fly and emailing customers invoices when they forget them or you need to look up how much they owe. no this isn't the full blown desktoponline version and i don't think that was the intent. it does what i need it to while i'm not at a computer.
worthless on ios13. out of all the apps i have, this is the only one that wasn’t ready for ios13. it was worthless during the entire public beta process & i was hoping with the actual ios 13 release, it would be updated. not the case, still worthless. doesn’t work on my iphone or ipad. it was the convenience of having quickbooks on the go that sold me in the first place. not the case anymore.
1 step forward  2 steps back. for the most part, the app functions correctly after finally resolving the issues with accepting credit cards. now, it wants to download the company information each morning. it is doing it on all the devices and accounts that our company uses. it's very frustrating when we need to quickly pull up a customers information only to be forced to wait for it to redownload all the info. hurry up and wait
"what are you thinking qb???. when you send invoice or proposal email, it doesn't come from your email but from ""qb do not reply email address"". so if customer wants to email you back with question or addition they have to start new email thread."
great app.. can do everything while on the move.
. just started and loving it i have only been using this app for a short time but it has helped me stay on top of the business side of my work and has made invoicing much easier!
makes life easier!. helps me keep record of everything from invoices, payments customers and expenses.
slow to update. pretty useless app.
incredibly glitchy. the app is glitchy despite updates. i’m not super impressed by intuit in general. i use their payroll for my business, a lot of glitches there too. app crashes or spontaneously exits my selections to “accept” for no reason and i have to start over. does not learn well, i have to reteach things over and over.
. what i don't like about quick book is that when u use your phone to record a payment. you have to use the computer to move the cash from undeposited cash to cash in hand. but it is a good accounting software. and i love it
request. how can i easily find the last price charged to the customer on a specific item?
email issue. when emailing invoicesestimates with other attachments the quickbooks attachment doesn't go through
signing out.... ugh this app keeps signing me out in the middle of my work.. please fix this soon.
mgrm. great app. useful and easy to use. sample and easy to use
. very user friendly great app great technical support i recommend it to anyone
. great app and very user friendly! love that i can create documents right from my phone!
allsecuresysyems. love this app. works great!
makes accounting much simpler. i've been using this app for a few months and find it to be really easy and accommodating. the app when used in conjunction with my desktop program helps to alleviate a lot of ambiguity and oversight.
very good. it should be able to synchronize with quickbooks desk top.the online version on the pc sucks!!!! not user friendly,and very limeted,
. this update is very bad. activities don't come up anymore. have to navigate to long to find stuff... i don't need to see company details first. i need to see customer activities.... this is such a waste of time and very frustrating. now i have to search for a new program. the app on a mobile device doesn't even open. it says sync problem. it's been days since i logged into the app. always problems with this company. the app is terrible.....
bad customer service and bad app. i’m use only one month is the most terrible app. never used this app
not good. crashes often; slow; give frequent error messages.
owner. love this app work great.
loved it.... very useful app... i can use it in any platform. that is the the best thing. loved a lot !!!!!
awesome, powerful app. we've been using quickbooks for years, this app allows us to take all our bookkeeping at our finger tips
. love this app
garbage. doesn't log in. rubbish. unimpressed
i like this software but not sure. how do i export this information or report or how do i print
. i love it ...just wish i could personalize information fields on the invoices to accommodate the type of work we do mobile mechanics add fields for vehicle # vin # license plate and mileage would be awesome
jason arnold. so far quickbooks has been great. their program has some flaws i’m told they are working on. the payroll is very very slow to get up and running. but all i. all it saves me time and money
. great app
not impressed. started using the app because it was recommended to install it with quickbooks online. the app does not show any up to date transactions that were entered on the quickbooks desktop version, you cannot search by phone number or address only customer name in the app also. i would have thought the app would have been more useful to use while out in the field.
so far so good.. i spent about nine or 10 hours trying to get my quickbooks program converted over to my mobile phone from my desktop after speaking with someone that barely spoke any english for six or seven hours i was told to call back the following day because they could not figure out what i needed to get done when i called back the next day thank god someone that spoke english answered and i had my problem resolved in about 20 minutes.
don’t use the pay options.. app is great but don’t use the pay option. it took a week for the money to hit my account.
app. grate app worth purchasing i'd recommend this to anyone
. where do i start. purchased to help with accounts for small self employment business. did not upload new transactions from bank account or paypal as advertised on app or the full site. mileage tracker was not accurate. user interface too basic. so frustrating as i would use this constantly but as it does not upload my transactions properly, it is unusable. far too glitchey as an app. wish i had done free trial and not wasted money on it.
pretty good!!. just started my business and so far liking what i’m seeing. the app is pretty neat.
invaluable. i am a mobile mechanic and use quickbooks on my journeys to write invoices, receipts and estimates. i wouldn't be without it
quickbooks review. i'm just getting started and i'm definitely not a detail oriented person. quickbooks (so far) has made it very easy to input and the ability to link accounts makes it very simple.
. another app failed to provide the timely support i needed. i have used quickbooks before and i am sure i will have a great experience!
. great app
. working hard to get this goning
. love that i can create invoices and estimates on the go. although i would like to manage payroll wirelessly.
app is crashing.... had to key in a credit card thru the computer because the app keeps crashing and doesn’t let you charge a card. will change my review after they fix the issue.
fabulous!. i really like using qb, i'm a small business owner and once i got the idea of things i find qb relatively easy to use. when integration starts with square it will be 5 stars for me 😊
wonderful app.. wonderful app. makes my life so much easier. wish i would have signed up with qbo earlier.
absolutely inconsistent. probably the worst app i had on my phone. i have deleted it. it gives incorrect, inconsistent notifications. it’s completely useless to access certain parts of qbo. how incredibly unfortunate that intuit can’t build an app that can compare with the advances made in qbo.
great functionality. exactly what my clients need. i can review all transactions from all my clients on the go, this makes bookkeeping fun for my customers and saves a lot of time and money that's what i love!
perfect for my business. i like that i can access any information quickly. very easy to use for everyone. the invoicing, payments, and sales reports are perfect for a small business. my only wish is that quick books small business would integrate easily with quick books online. maybe soon this will happen ?
please fix me. ios 13 ijust upgrade cannot write items into invoices
very easy to use with my s5 from anywhere. very handy when you are out of the office and need to send invoices right away. love it
. where a brand new bakery, and this has been great! we can quickly do invoices and get paid. our bookkeeper especially loves this!
background usage accounts for 50 percent of battery life. this app completely drains my battery. i thought my battery was broken and was about to replace it, but apple tech report suggested i check on battery usage by app and i discovered quickbooks was the culprit.
can someblet tell me where are my products ???. trying to do a new invoice but can’t see my products once i hit the + bottom
app doesn't connect on ios 9. ever since ios upgrade 9.3 and quickbooks mobile app doesn't sign in, always says check internet connection. it's a bug in the app and they know it, we contacted support to fix it and they said they are working on it and will have a solution by end of may. this problem has been on for more than 4 weeks with no solution. poor app with poor support. not recommended at all.
. please add support for whattsup business app
. this app has made my life much easier while handling my business accounts!
works like it should. the app works like you would expect it to and i have nothing but good things to say about quickbooks support!
. my wife has this app and it works well for her business. i got this app based on her recommendation but unfortunately it has been full of technical difficulties. several hours wasted on talking to tech support and was told the tech team might resolve issues in a week. all details of my invoices are erased and wrong dates are shown on all invoices amongst other problems. wish they could solve this faster, has been very stressful experience so far for me.
purchased but won’t work.. i can not contact customer service to save my life!! i purchased this after my trial but it won’t acknowledge that i have. very upset and frustrated!!!
. when it comes to converting an estimate to an invoice or processing transactions, the app experience is excellent and even preferred to the desktop version. smooth and easy to learn.
my business has transformed.. i have received multiple compliments from my customers regarding my new invoices and estimates.
. quick and easy to use. clients have been very receptive to there invoices or estimates. definitely have recommended this to other small business owners.
convenient but you pay for it. this app is really handy but they jack the prices up on you once you’ve gone through all the hassle of inputting your info. they know you won’t probably mess with changing programs once you’ve wasted all that time and energy. it is nice to use, however.
. awesome company! app works great!
fácil de usar. muy buena herramienta para administrar mi negocio👍🏼
i can't stand this program. logins don't work most of the time. functionality is severely limited (no expense tracking, no bill entry?! seriously). crashes regularly. horrible customer service.
love it. small business, no need for a more complicated program, cane send estimates and invoices from my phone. fantastic
update broke. i cannot accept transactions. the only things accessible on the baking screens are back and trash. please fix otherwise it’s useless.
. nice site to make invoice and estimate, if there is any option to maintain stock it will. be great
"problematic app. upon originally downloading this app i was pleased. for the first 24hrs. i was impressed. then, i ""sent"" an invoice which the customer never received. next, it failed to update or sync with my account. when i attempted to update manually it chronically reported an error sighting that i should check my internet connection. frustrated, i uninstalled and reinstalled the app. now, it doesn't stay open for long before saying it stopped unexpectedly. i've reported every error without receiving any feedback."
business easy. i enjoy qb on my phone! it makes it easy to adjust, stay updated, quickly send or add while on the go!
quick books app. absolutely love this app, its works fabulously well on my iphone. my only gripe with the app and it's operations is that not all of my customer emails that are sent are being received by my customers. i have highlighted this to quickbooks and they were extremely unhelpful in assisting with rectifying this matter, which i found extremely disappointed given this is a paid subscription service, and not a free service.
". updating my review since the login issue has been fixed. the quickbooks app it has been very useful for my mobile business. i'm glad to see they finally made where i can attach pdf documents to the invoice. the only thing i i would like to see updated is when the customer signs the invoice it currently just shows their signature, i would like it to say ""signed by:"" and even be able to type their name as signatures are virtually impossible to read."
please fix!!. i have used this app for the last few years for my business and have loved it. this latest update has made the app virtually unusable. it won't let me save an invoice, doesn't show payments made, makes me sign in every time even though i have a pin and the list goes on. very disappointed and hoping this is fixed soon.
quickbooks user. enjoy most of the features but absolutely drives me insane that it doesn’t auto save. i’ll be working on a project get a phone call my ipad shuts down and i lose hours worth of work.
great tool. a great app for invoicing on the fly and emailing customers invoices when they forget them or you need to look up how much they owe. no this isn't the full blown desktoponline version and i don't think that was the intent. it does what i need it to while i'm not at a computer.
love it!!!. this app makes things so easy to keep track of a job while in the field and saves time. love it!!!!
very handy little app. as said in other reviews it is a little different from the computer version but it is such an easy way for me to do my invoices on the go! it's all set to go and it tracks all of my invoices and sends me reminds of unpaid one too! great little helper!
brilliant mobile app. it has changed my life . i am able to do quotes in the run and save so much valuable time .
. keeps crashing when entering receipts. it's infuriating. updated review 6 months later still crashes when splitting an expense. tried deleting the cache. it's useless.
qb review.. great program. not able to print checks from app or change the total without adding all the line items amounts. i.e. estimates with multiple amounts as different options on the same estimate.
crashes when downloading. crashes when downloading after initial setup. have not been able to use app. disappointing.
. excellent lots of options for writing reports and looking up data
powerful. very good, gives almost all of the functionality as the browser version except for splitting and journal entries. but for daily review and acceptance of linked electronic transactions, this is great! also has a good p&l and balance sheet report.
bank transactions not loaded. there are several limitations with this app. but my major issue is the inability to load bank transactions. the connected bank account goes sometimes for weeks or months without the transactions transferred to qb. other times they are uploaded every couple of days. there is no option to upload the transactions manually through the app. i called customer service but no one helped. this makes the phone app pretty much useless.
. omg invoices still not updating. i have recorded payments and online show paid. this app shows them past due since august. app sucks
great app. been with quickbooks for two years now and still really impressed very easy to use and works across all platforms would strongly recommend
invoicing on the go!. the app is a great companion to the online version. allows me to invoice and keep track of billable items on the go. there is so much more it does but for me invoicing right after the job is done gives me freedom to do my office work while having a coffee.
. where do i start. purchased to help with accounts for small self employment business. did not upload new transactions from bank account or paypal as advertised on app or the full site. mileage tracker was not accurate. user interface too basic. so frustrating as i would use this constantly but as it does not upload my transactions properly, it is unusable. far too glitchey as an app. wish i had done free trial and not wasted money on it.
qb app !!!. love the app ! now with the new update i can log in with touch id :))) how fan, and saving much time.
not nearly as good as the desktop version.. the idea is great but i need it to be able to update to and from my desktop version easily which is nearly impossible.
. i truly love quickbooks although... they could improve on the mobile app as i find that it lags sometimes and takes awhile to open when you click on the app.
good for basic functions.. would be better if invoices that are sent could have the ability to pay online, luke when being sent from desktop. more invoice history also..limited to 50 right now.
ability to do transfers. good app just wish i could do transfers between my bank accounts the same as the online version.
best accountant i’ve used.. seriously helped me narrow down how many hats my small business required me to wear. wish i done it sooner.
. the quickbooks app allows me to easily manage my business expenses on the go and eliminates the need to keep those annoying receipts. instead you can jt take a picture of the receipt and attach it to the expense. brilliant.
". crashes too much. many times new customers and info can't be seen on the app, unless i uninstall and reinstall!!! i get a ""unable to refresh"" message constantly. it's extremely hard to enter new customers and revise existing ones from the app."
great app. makes life easy. one addition will make it perfect. add journal entry to the app.
love this app!. i absolutely love this app. it allows me to run my business efficiently and effectively!
"so frustrating. ""updated"" the app... telling me now that i need a new version of the app and since i already have it, not sure what i'm supposed to do. even my accountant agrees quickbooks online is too confusing. waiting for 2016 to close out my books and use a new program."
". so broken that the ""report an issue"" button doesn't even work. login takes multiple tries, vendor activities are all empty, clearing cache does not help, android back buttom exits the app without even a confirmation. as much as i enjoy using the website, this app is pure frustration."
pretty good. the app allows you to record expenses on the go as they happen. nice to be able to balance the books as you go along instead of waiting until you are back at your computer. :)
owner. i can't add attachments without it freezing. crashes constantly and touch id does not work
. i have contacted customer service several times for support issues with the appquickbooks online not syncing the transactions automatically. no one seems to have an answer on what's going on. each time i'm advised by a customer service represenative to remove and reconnect the bank account yet in doing so it still doesn't work.
quick books online is awesome. this app and online software allows you to send estimates that customers can approve electronically then after its approved and the work is done the same estimate transitions into an invoice at the push of a button. after the customer pays, that information can be easily stored for tax purposes. awesome!
game changer. changed the way i handle my business transactions. from a simple to complex my invoices and estimates are presentable, traceable and accounted for. my reports help me secure loans in a flash. and my accountant loves me.
won’t load in ios 13. need an update. ios 13 crashes. won’t load.
can't live without it. i don't know how i did business before this app. i love that i can access my company books anywhere. i love the way i can take a photo of the receipts for my expenses. thank you qb!
. i've been using quickbooks for a few years. it's been great. but lately i haven't been able to access old invoices or quotes. very inconvenient for past work that we've done. now i'm having a huge issue with latest data not syncing to my device and can't even get into my account. things should be getting better not worse. i've consulted with customer service which hasn't helped either.
. it's a great app. i use it all the time with my company. very efficient, and easy to navigate. automatically logs out so no one else can get access to it ( logs out after being in active for a certain amount of time). making banking, estimate invoice, and employees records very easy to keep track of. also love that i can store customers an accept payment online also. only downside sometimes it can be slow but other than that it's outstanding
easy. i have found this app very easy to use. being able to tap into your invoicing system when out on a job. it enables me to issue an invoice same moment the job is finished and emailed to my customer stood in front of me, that way my customer has a paperless invoice and can pay you right away. saves time!
. these updates to the app and online service are worthless and have screwed up the format entirely. the latest update (91117) has caused the online version to work at a snail's pace! i'm using a brand new hp with intel 7th gen, and a terabyte!!! stop updating stuff that works fine!!!!
bad update. can no longer accept credit card payments. keep getting error code 6000. tech support advised this is a known issue but no eta on fix. please revert back to previous version.
great ui and mobile to desktop experience. i just started using quickbooks about two months ago and i don't know what i would do without it now. it's simple, easy to run a freelance business with. it's helped me become a freelance business and get paid which is the most important part :)
nice, but naughty. i am writing this review at christmas, that explains the headline :) this app used to be awesome. now i get a lot of can not connect to data or can not refresh data even after multiple refreshes. hope they fix it
good, not great. you can do the basics, like sync bank accounts, run a few basic reports. but you can’t take many useful actions or get reliable search results. the bank accounts render weirdly. it’s more like a novelty rather than a tool.
". updating my review since the login issue has been fixed. the quickbooks app it has been very useful for my mobile business. i'm glad to see they finally made where i can attach pdf documents to the invoice. the only thing i i would like to see updated is when the customer signs the invoice it currently just shows their signature, i would like it to say ""signed by:"" and even be able to type their name as signatures are virtually impossible to read."
band download not working. can't download bank transactions for months now.
quickbook online plus. it's alright. i hope u can work on the invoice template options to add: * individual discount% column for each input * additional description column * additional customized invoice number top rhs * ability to change currency on the invoice itself * add exchange rate manually
pretty good app. have an issue with multi tasking. app doesn't stay in the multi tasking overflow menu, so when working with my calendar, i need to manually open the app again from the app drawer. pretty frustrating. it's supposed to be a productivity app for small businesses, but its really not
majestique. excellent app. does everything it says. company financial is tracked better onthego.
works great. works great for my small business. not sure why there are bad reviews, qbo keeps up with my customers information, invoices, and estimates. very easy to use. now on this last update, i did have to uninstall and reinstall on my andriod phone, but within 5 minutes i was back up and running.
very handy little app. as said in other reviews it is a little different from the computer version but it is such an easy way for me to do my invoices on the go! it's all set to go and it tracks all of my invoices and sends me reminds of unpaid one too! great little helper!
not accurate. even after the most recent update the app still dose not accurately reflect my qbo account. all information on vended and clients are not up to date. this had been an ongoing issue for more than a year now. i keep hoping with every update this will be correct, but nothing yet.
best version yet!!. i run a company with revenues over 2 million dollars annually with qb. i can take care of everything i need from invoicing, estimating and accounts payable to payroll and everything in between. the app adds even more flexibility by not requiring my laptop or tablet to create these. the reports and reconciliations are second to none.
comprehensive app for a small business. i have excellent experience and is easy to use with all functionality that i required. have tried xero, myob as well but quickbooks stand out for me as far as feature & function and good value for money.
. pretty easy and intuitive to use. i'm sure there is even more benefits than i know as i am fairly new to the mobile app.
bad.. very bad. it just plain don't work and when i called tech support they said it is working fine it must be my phone well i have tried it on another phone and still get the same thing.... for what i paid for this service it should work.. maybe i should just go back to the old version and not pay the monthly fee!!!!
it's not working. it's not working in india for aondrid os .. useless app
crashes, not usable, nexus 5x. crashes and no longer usable on a stock nexus 5x on android 6.0.1. app is now useless to me on my phone which is a major problem.
. great software!!
. app is amazing everything i need for my company is in the app. really worth it
fantastic app. love that you can attach photos on the fly!
couldn’t get past sign up!. i downloaded the app and started the “freetrial” setup. it asked for my business name, then my countryregion. when i tapped to enter countryregion, it gave no options. it was blank and did not bring up keyboard for manual entry. so i can’t even use it.
. i can't even login, there is some kind of bug.
very nice!. i love have this power in my phone! i can email invoices or print them out, all on my phone! this app is easy to learn and soooooo fast when you get used to it. there was a lot of thinking when they designed this app, wow
useless!. can't edit products without losing the changes. can't edit purchases. overall, still very buggy and slow. had to buy a windows 10 tablet to get it to work. mobile apps for ios and android sucks big time!
intuitive and very useful!. i'm surprised at how easy this app is to use and how much functionality it has. i'm able to do pretty much all of my typical day to day tasks within this app. it's extremely useful to be able to quickly put together an estimate for a client from my phone or categorize a transaction. intuit, you've done a great job here!
. it keeps saying check back in a few hours when i attempt to look at my bank transactions. very glitchy
o melhor!. excelente!!! minha ferramenta de gestão financeira.
great, not perfect.... if you're looking for snapshots of where your company finances are, this app is great. it works well for giving me good information on the go. however, it seems like real, intensive work is best saved for the online version. i really like it but understand the limitations. worth a try, certainly.
awesome. i use it on my mobile, very efficient and fast in the field , for quick creation of invoices and quotations, on the spot so i never lose the opportunity to acquire a new jobs and customers
ios 9. with the new os signatures on the iphone are no longer saved to invoices, instead the app just crashes. when people become dependent on specific features and then they stop working it leads to a lot of extra work. please fix this feature asap.
. does want to launch properly on huawei p30. android version 9 please assist.
almost perfect. please add the ability to print or download packing slips from the mobile app. everything else can wait till i am back in the office. sometimes a packing slip must be done in a rush. mobile app is useless to me without the packing slip feature.
. michael amazing app works flawlessl!!!!
. super powerful and great on the go. there is a learning curve as with anything this powerful but quickbooks makes it easy to learn and has the best customer service
***** updated latest.. very useful.
good product for on the go bookkeeping.. i have more than a few clients i do bookkeeping for. this apple ap does a good job of keeping up with their books. the bank feed is by far better than the desktop version and it can be done on my iphone. i moved my company books from the desktop to qbo so i can invoice on the go instead of waiting to get back to my office.
. terrible app and company. they hold your money and request ridiculous amounts of proof to get it back.
new business.. very user friendly. almost like apple designed it. very unhappy that the email function doesn’t work. many people have complained for over a year and quickbooks still hasn’t offered a fix😠. i have to take a screenshot and copy and paste to my email. not as professional looking, but gets the job done. that one glitch took away two stars because i can’t use my mobile phone to give someone an invoice or estimate.
amazing. at last i can invoice on the move and do the rest of my book keeping as i go. great app and easy to use.
ipad mini. app works great
. very confusing, it's easier to just go to the website.
needs expenses  time functionality.. obvious missing functionality.
. nice concept but still have to buy additional app :(
broken for ios 13 please update. when you jack up the price 25% i expect more
this has made my life infinitely easier!. intuitively designed, have yet to need a feature it doesn't have!
easy to use. great system, much cheaper than other accounting systems, user friendly and plenty of help if you do get stuck. definitely 5 star
no employee support. this app doesn't allow you to do anything unless your account is the owner of the books you are looking at. i was added to the subscription but upon logging into the app was told i had no subscriptions. also unable to use my browser as mobile support doesn't exist for the website and they take it a step further by detecting you are using a phone a blocking you from a non mobile version of the site. very disappointing.
love the changes. when i go and look at the transaction using my iphone... i could see the time when the payment was made... i hope it would also show if it's paid in cash, card or check without clicking the invoice...
i looking. hai friends my name is navas abdulla i'm looking some software live sales report ..in store sales promotions company ..any one can to suggest any live sales, report software for sales promoters www.qmpromotions.com it's my website qmpromotions@gmail.com
credit card payments. with this new update, i cannot select payed with credit card without being prompted to swipe a card. i use square for my credit card transactions, so i don't need to use qb. only cash and check can be selected now.
. i can't delete my account! i installed the app, and create profile, but it seems that there is no way you can't delete your account or ask quick book to forget your info, i'm afraid i shared my info.
great app. love the details and ability to invoice or add customers on the go!
how did they not see this coming?. quickbooks is currently not working on any update from apple. doesn't work in ios 10, doesn't work on safari 10 on the mac, can't download the mac app! business has been crippled for days. a business app like this needs far better reliability!
simple, just plain works.... easy to set up, use and send invoices, receive payments and figure out the taxes.
most of the buttons don’t work anymore. how could you make something this bad? buttons like accept transfer do not work. if this this was any more of a dog, it would shed. wake up and fix this over priced piece of poop!
no activity?. none of my vendors have any activity (transactions) available within this app. almost rendering it completely useless in our business.
suberb. really great app
poor need lots of work. this app is terrible on the ios and android. i’m using it on both and it has tooo many bugs...
. love this app. can upload receipts wherever i am
the application for the tablet. the application for my ipad tablet does not let me see checks i have written that have not cleared. (it does show my account balance) i like the online version but i for the life of me don’t know why the internet based application does not work on my ipad plus and their application for ipads is simply said  horrible.
very good app.... i truly love this app! it permits me to oversee my business' financial condition in real time. i use the qbo plus, it would be nice if it had more of the options present in qb premium for consultants. the project management and customer billing customization would make this an even better app.
great app for small business owners!. i have a handyman business and this app made the paperwork side of the business easy!! i definitely recommend
awesome cloud computing. this is great! i’ll never have to worry about whether or not i have a valid backup of my company data (as i did on the desktop version). my data is safely in the cloud and accessible to me from any device with internet access that i choose! tracking of income and expense easy here through the mobile app with access to reconciliation on the full web version. easy to use!
cant edit payroll options. cant make a lot of changes pertinent to online users who need access thru their phone.
sync problema.... does not sync transactions with business bank and credit card unless you login to the quicbooks website...i have to login to the website all the time to use the app..what good is the app..disappointed that such a well funded company can have such a poorly developed app
not connecting. used to work. now after login it's not connecting.
great when working. this app is a great app , however every time that apple do an update it seems to cause issue in regards to the program recognising that you have a up to date subscription
participated promoted priceless!. it enhances your ability to multitask better than others. sleek app for all business owner's success!
. using a samsung note edge: cannot update estimates at all. been using this app for months and it constantly locks up and crashes. in response to the developer: it seems i have to reinstall it every day just to get it work. i have been doing this fix for a long time and it still does not resolve the locking up or crashing problem.
. love to be available to quote, inovice, charge, see my clients, etc. on the go. i just have a few times that wasn't available to log in but overall good app
disappointed. downloaded this app so i could buy the payroll feature for my new company but it crashes immediately upon opening.
limited compared to quickbooks desktop. quickbooks online is just ok. it has some limits that did not exist in the desktop version. a lot of them have to do with assisted payroll. for example, the app does not tell you each pay period how much of a contribution to pay towards simple ira's and give you a chance to indicate whether they were paid. it just assumes it was done without giving you any notice. other limitations make it just ok.
. make sure you know what services they provide, as customer support likely knows less than you do.
confusing. very difficult to use.
so helpful. my business is basically my husband and me. when we are both out of the office, it's been difficult to have to wait to help customers. this app has allowed me to to create an invoice from an estimate, accept payment and send a receipt all from the truck!
. inuit customer service is a joke
i love quickbooks online. i love quickbooks online & my accountant does also. this app is really good for doing your expenses on but as far as invoicing i still do it on the computer. it's very handy for a small business. the fact you can enter an expense, take a picture of the receipt & go on your merry way. i'm sold.
this app is harmful. support is useless or you really can’t recover the emails you sending to the clients with your invoice
needs to fix bugs. i love quickbooks online and the desktop version but their mobile app needs to fix their bugs. i told quickbooks support two months ago that i couldn't email an invoice from the app and they couldn't help me fix the problem then. i still cannot send invoices from my mobile app so it is basically useless to me.
. moderate user, nice to estimate and invoice on the go
. amazing app ever!!
. best mobile financial app for a small businesses period
. excellent including mobile app
. love this app for it's ability to let me keep track of my job expenses and billing amounts. i will certainly recommend this app for my colleagues.
it sucks. after a year it erase the clients info. and it doesn't give you the option to edit to purchase order.
does not do simple qb tasks. this app does not have all the functions as the computer online version. i can't run simple reports and the payroll app which is separate does not allow me to make changes to the employee information. doesn't function like you need it to and it put me in a bind when i went out of town with just my ipad. i would not even give it one star. worthless.
crashes still to often. fairly good  duplicates imported credit credit transactions. freezescrashes too often. doesn't allow you to specify where payments go ...always undeposited funds ...
. this app has been great for be and my small business it helps me to be able to stay on track of my invoices in and out at the touch of my screen.
take me back. new updates are awful. keeps crashing..unable to do simple functions on the go such as editing invoice, sending a statement, etc. old version was much better. change it back to how it was..not every update is a good update. especially not this one.
simple, yet capable. does everything i need and i love being able to use it online, iphone and ipad. on the go flexibility is a must and this app does that flawlessly!
almost there. the developers are working hard at making this the best accounting package for smes. especially ones whose top management actively participates in reviewing reports. great for compact companies. great for hands on ceos. please check other reviews for page organisations and their experience.
. when it comes to converting an estimate to an invoice or processing transactions, the app experience is excellent and even preferred to the desktop version. smooth and easy to learn.
. very useful app.
. not free at all.. they take your valuable information such as email and phone numbers.. then say its 30 days trial.. you will have to pay to get this apps.. many of good free accounting apps are available in play store..
easy to use. a very easy to use software that is cloud based with a great phone app. i’ve been using this for some time now and it evolves every year. most for the best. a helpful help call centre should you have any problems. 4 stars as i don't believe you can back this up
crashes. app is unusable after ios 13.0 update.. crashes. app is unusable after ios 13.0 update.
. gr8 app
good deal. i appreciate this app. it helps me keep an eye on my business so i'm not always sitting in front of my laptop.
"not as good as it was.. getting worse. incorrect allocation of funds to invoices. the mobile app doesn't allow expense entering anymore (""we're working on it""  november 16). yes, you can see invoices and forward from the phone, but wouldn't want to do anything else. come on qb, get your act together. u.k."
ap crashes instantly on my iphone x. i have been a quickbooks user for about 3 years already. ever since i got my iphone x app doesn’t even open. i have tried hard restart, setting as a new iphone and still encounter the same problems. it’s incredible that i’m not able to use it now.
waiting for delayed charge on mobile app.. otherwise, its good!
. great app, works well with the desktop and online versions. great to have my financial info at my fingertips when i need it.
handy. the mobile app is very convenient for entering expenses on the go. you can add photos of receipts and create new customers and suppliers easily. profit & loss and balance sheet function gives you a quick snapshot of your business. overall, the app is quite handy to use for small businesses.
huge asset for small business. love the flexibility this app provides. i can do everything from the app that i can do from the desktop although it takes twice as long. however, as a small business owner being the accountant and the laborer it is great having the ability to pull up invoices with clients and email invoices on the go.
. i had an issue that didnt get resolved so i deactivated my account and still getting charged after.
. very hard and confusing to use i was lead to believe it would be simple and easy but having spent hours going back and forward i think im going to cut my losses and stick to letting my accountant do it all
. subscribed at the top tier quickbooks subscription, but i cannot check my inventory on the mobile app. i cannot express how sad i am, that should the first feature to ever be implemented but its just not there.
. im not satisfied at all im at the trial but its hard to link with my account i dont know why? please help me before i delete it for good
. fine app. would get 5 stars when i can do inventory
love it!. i am a locksmith, need an easy and efficient easy to manage invoicing, books, transactions... qbo has saved me hours every night logging and sending invoices, billing, and balancing my books through my bank. i send invoices on the fly now, and all of the related bookwork is completed simultaneously... seriously wonder how i found the time to complete everything this does for me from my phone or tablet in my car. a real time saver!
. quickbooks is simple to use and makes the book work easy for myself as a small business.
. i haven't been able to use this app for a really long time, all the sudden it doesn't save my login details anymore, hard to login, once i logged in and try to go next step, it logged me out and says tempary not available. super annoying!!
great app and fair prices. i do all my business through quick books and have had no major problems. the rates on credit transactions are equivalent to any other clearing house and at $30 a month to automate my process is a life saver. great simple to read reports too.
poor functionality. constant crashes inability to complete selected tasks poor functionality this app try’s hard but doesn’t quiet make it with its functions. it didn’t at all shot me but that’s what the 3 day free trial is for. i wasn’t going to rate this app but after they charged me $10.50 for a 1 month subscription after i cancelled and deleted the app; i will rate it
great app. i use it for business all the time it helps as my business is mobile always in the vehicle.
. best accounting app i've tried, much easier than kashflow for example
great app. for my business is been really helpful app. i'm a painter contractor, check job all day, if i need to send estimates and invoices now i can do it on the road.
. awesome app, does everything i need to operate a small business.
. will not honor my subscription. extremely unhelpful support, giving me the run around. 1 week into paying, still no use of the app, and they will not help!
update breaks layout in iphone xr. latest update breaks the invoices page layout. long client names force the amount column into a single space column. now the amounts show like this. $1 2 3 4 instead if this $1234
. i've been using quickbooks desktop for 15 years and have always loved it. the switch to online was as smooth as can be. this app is saving me time and money. i highly recommend!
. think it is great to a point. having trouble posting a sales receipt. can't get to my comp. wanting and needing more.
app doesn't connect on ios 9. ever since ios upgrade 9.3 and quickbooks mobile app doesn't sign in, always says check internet connection. it's a bug in the app and they know it, we contacted support to fix it and they said they are working on it and will have a solution by end of may. this problem has been on for more than 4 weeks with no solution. poor app with poor support. not recommended at all.
makes life a whole lot easier. the easy way to track you business.
rubbish. absolutely rubbish since the last update . keeps crashing on iphone xr. screen message = app needs to close due to critical updates. happens 2030 x times a day when trying to set up an invoice estimate etc. test your updates before release you them, you idiots!
works but needs work. for the most part the product works, but has many errors and sometimes says there are errors but they are never fixed, i run the lasted ios on an iphone 6 and still have many problems
excellent and easy to use. fantastic app would recommend it to anyone that asks
. very good no problems with it.
buggy. since updating to the latest version i can’t view invoices from the home screen or even update and send invoices from the invoices screen. hire some competent engineers.
great. this app helps my small business tremendously. very easy to navigate, enter and retrieve data. very affordable.
simple and reliable. never quits. wicked easy to use.
. so easy to use and navigate
waste of time. don't waste your time if you want to access quickbooks on your ipad or tablet. needs a lot more work
qbo ipad & iphone. i think that intuit is doing an incredible job with this product! the updates have been wonderful for me. it would be 5 stars if i could make bank deposits as well! i've upgraded to 5 stars since i can now do deposits as well. is bank transfer in the future?
. jai presentement un bug. perdu les taxes
not happy any longer!. having issues logging in every single time now, very frustrating and not happy at all. always asking for finger print, and when typing in my password, it takes about 5 attempts before it’ll login to my company info. also having a constant lag when trying to inputsubmit any items to customers. this is extremely upsetting when trying to submit invoices before a deadline.
very user friendly!. quick books makes life simple!
invoice and estimates not saving after last update. you will have to delete app. then reinstall then it will save.
all the essentials in an app. works good so far. allows for quick sorting of transactions and gives all of the essential components for a mobile version. it would be nice to be able to work in budgets in app.
qb app. not useful as it could be as you can't enter a bill! not being able to enter a bill makes it useless to work from an ipad or tablet device.
great app!. this app has saved me tons of time and i love it!
. great app
incomplete functionality. there's no way to run a report, print it to a pdf and mail it to someone, or even save the report to storage, as far as i can see. i'm on the road, want to send the balance sheet to one of my colleagues, but can't see any way to do this from the app.
pretty useless. can't mark an expense as billable therefore can't create invoices by automatically including up billed expenses can't record deposits can't view downloaded trans action useless
best app for small businesses. i own and operate a small it consulting company and this is the best business management app in the world. i can literally walk into an office or home of a new customer, add their information and invoice them on the spot. no need to mail an invoice and wait days or weeks. not to mention its very inexpensive.
improving phase one detsiling. awesome app to help budget and keep my finances straight. the one feature that i love is how our customers are not only sync online on our computer but also our iphones and android lg tablets. that is priceless
needs additional function. this is a great app for limited situations. it needs support for bills, deposits, and bill payments.
they discontinued this app. do not download this. they stopped the link so it no longer works. too bad because i was using this to run my business and now i'm screwed. i have to find another app quick to do my invoices with. i like razorsync for scheduling but i am not thrilled with their estimating and invoicing. if intuit had kept this up and just made some improvements it would be great!
awful. i don’t typically leave negative reviews but if i have to watch an invoice that i am editing disappear one more time i’ll loose my mind. clunky and prehistoric programme pen and paper would be quicker
would like more features. there are some features missing from the mobile version that i prefer  like seeing my bank account register even though i’m connected online; transferring info to turbotax; and automatically crediting extra payments on an account to the next invoice. unfortunately, i cannot transfer to another version except by hand, so i’m staying with this version.
. great app .... just makes life easy!!!
. great app and very simple to use. just what my construction company needed to be legit
quickbooks online mobile. this app is very good and getting better. soon it will be as good as desktop version. thanks quickbooks team.
love it!. qb is stunningly simple yet superbly sufficient to handle our business needs for invoicing clients, reporting ar and preparing us for yearend taxes. the mobil app is equally impressive!
laborious expenses assignments. uploading pictures of billable expenses requires two lengthy entries...first at point of upload info is requested... but for accounting purposes only. second step is required to access list of expenses online and then manually retype all info listed under accounts into item chart...date, item, splits, quantity, rate, amount, check billable and then reenter client to be billed. why this can’t be entered once at point of upload is rediculously annoying. my manual invoicing system took less time than this program takes!
must buy two services. i’m selfemployed and need to track miles as well as be able to send estimates. with “quickbooks selfemployed” you can track miles but you cannot send estimates. with “quickbooks online” you can send estimates but you cannot track mileage. to me, these things should be doable with the same serviceapp but here they are not. plus, customer service is not educated on their product or helpful.
so happy. awesome app
. sluggish, cant get bank account info. each log in was a hassle. i uninstalled it after 2 days. is this the beta?
since ios 13 update not full screen. can believe this is the 5th update si ce then, and you can’t fix on iphone 11 pro full screen notch lack, we pay a lot monthly for this crap, so frustrating
great for handyman businesses. qb is great for me! i run a handyman business and my office is at my clients place or in my truck. i can sent estimatesinvoices while i am on site. it so nice because i use my tablet or phone when i’m on the road and when i’m home i can use qb on my computer and everything is automatically updated
won't download. the app says that there is not enough storage on my device yet the file size is just over 30 mb and i have well over 100 mb of available storage. very frustrating!
. solid a love the mobility and ease of use for my small business. just wish i could void or cancel invoices and estimates on the app.
. i've downloaded this app, uninstalled it, and reinstalled it and it will not allow me to create an account. it continually signs me out and i have to reenter all my information. i'm giving up!
. i gave it a week b4 i changed my rating my qb is now working perfectly no more stress on updating my sales n payments... thanks team 5 star well deserved
good unless u need their help. i had a problem as accidentally created 2 companies in the one profile. subscription applied to wrong company and they had no idea how to fix it. the company with all my accounting was cancelled as ‘trial ended’ but other company with no data was fully subscribed. very frustrating when dealing with idiots in the phone!
credit card payments. with this new update, i cannot select payed with credit card without being prompted to swipe a card. i use square for my credit card transactions, so i don't need to use qb. only cash and check can be selected now.
just too expensive.... i run a small business and can't afford the monthly dues of qbo. hoping they come up with a more competitive product at some point...
limited features. good app but still too many features missing that require logging in to the website. e.g. vat and paying salaries as expenses.
great and makes things easier. the best thing about quick books is that they have unlimited live customer service to help guide and assist you. that's a real plus to me.
disappointed. i’ve been using the phone app for a year now. when the app works it is fine however it constantly freezes and my only option is to restart my phone. i have deleted and downloaded the app several times but it has not fixed the issues.
simple and easy. great for keeping tabs on your business on the go but would love to have the actual versus budget comparison on the dashboard instead of having to bring up a report.
new update sucks. latest update for android takes forever to refresh and save invoices. almost unusable for me when i'm on the job. takes over five minutes to save an invoice and then even longer to print one if will will even let me...tried to uninstall and reinstall and reboot and everything it still takes way too long to refresh and save.
one in all. i can run my business with great confidence because of this application available of quickbooks online. one my favorite functions is the capability of producing estimates, and invoices immediately. that function pleases a majority of my professional field clients.
gerald. tax . tax here applied is actually confusing as only sales tax is taken into account. it's as if purchases or expenses are not taxed. if you need to claim tax on purchases or expenses doesn't show anything. it's as if i do it manually or. how do i import quickbook intuit into quickbooks online. or why not merge some features in intuit to online. it's not only as you say to do invoice as you go but you can't account for your taxes.
great way to run a business. the way razorsync and quickbooks works together makes it possible for me to have a life after work! there are a few more things that would make life easier but overall a big thumbs up!
great app. nothing like doing invoices from the phone!
five stars!. has helped out tremendously when it comes to my business. it makes it so much easier to use then the paper receipt books. it helps me stay organized and keeps me updated to the second. thanks quickbooks!
. i am a quckbooks junky, but i have to agree with the comments. this app needs to link to quickbooks. it is useless. i love everything else qb does. i've used them for over 11 years. i really can't praise this company enough. super excited about the app for integrating affinity live!!!! just synced it.
good to review. i haven't got deep into it to create billing invoices yet but just to review what i've done from the work station, it's great.
couldn't do without it. the qb on line version has really simplified our operations. the ability to have multiple users from different locations, especially remote access, has made life easier. either using a laptop or my ipad is great when out of the office. the only thing i've found that the app does not allow me to do is prepare a purchase order. but, there seem to be periodic updates so hopefully this will be coming soon. i would recommend qb to any small business.
. love this app for my business!
can't create po's through app. i use quickbooks for 2 things mainly. to create estimatesinvoices and send pos once the invoice has been paid. i can't create po's with the app so it's useless. i have to go to the website every time i want to create a po. it makes no sense that they would leave this feature out.
app crashing in ios 13. please note that the app is crashes in ios 13. have not been able to open it sine updating. otherwise it is a fantastic application.
great little app. excellent app for basic book keeping invoicing etc and keep up with the book keeping on the fly. but to do the serious stuff you still need to work from a laptop or desktop.
might be better. purchases within the app are very expensive! and, by the way, the app cannot be considered as stable
great, clean app. although it's yet another expense for your business, it's well worth every cent. more of an investment for us and we use it for four different companies (yes four times the subscription fee). regardless, it will manage your company's finances as they should be. leaving you with less hassle and worries about your accounts and more time to focus on more important entrepreneurial things.
. issue with app was directed in app to call quickbooks online customer service. no solution after being on the phone for 2 hours, they ended up calling android and at&t to try and fix the issue, which made absolutely no sense to me and got us nowhere. customer service has no clue about anything app related including when the password reset does not send verification code. i ended up having a different company to resolve the issue for me. below instructions solved nothing.
appliance men. great app.. 💯. all you need to run your small business on the go ... team it up with square for the ultimate in portability team both up with an ipad and you have excellence
. i thibk quickbooks hitnthe mark here verybwell nice app not but having a subscription for it all worth it
. this app really needs the ability to add delayed charge. how else is a user supposed to log billable time spent in the field?
stay well away!. worst software i have used to date. zero customer service. ignores all complaints. takes forever to load. constant problems. not user friendly.
useless!. can't edit products without losing the changes. can't edit purchases. overall, still very buggy and slow. had to buy a windows 10 tablet to get it to work. mobile apps for ios and android sucks big time!
recurring payments.. i really wish i could set up recurring payments from the app and also delete invoices
good for on the go. good for on the o, definitely not the same as on the desktop, but pretty good app for most things you need to do quickly
quick books great program. except logging in is bit harder and not clear.
app constantly glitches and it's very slow. i've had so many issues with this app. lately it has been extremely slow, it randomly shuts down for no reason in the middle of inputting a transaction and it won't load larger invoices. i'm very disappointed as i use this on a daily basis for my business.
quick book rocks. best accounting package ever made. it links to your bank . cards directly. no need of much accounting knowledge. provide login to your accountant. operate from anywhere.
. slow customer service meant i was unable to upgrade from qbse to quickbooks online. tried clear books instead, app is not great but otherwise they are a vast improvement, particularly the bank sync which is so much more reliable. i get the feeling qb have grown too quickly and do not have the infrastructure to support their customers.
. great app
love this app!. i love this app! having this has simplified how we run our business and makes it extremely easy to professionally deliver our product to our customers on the go!
. haven't been able to access my books since early september, can only use desktop app, browser and mobile app gives error message. contacted support 4+, engineers are working on known problem...10 weeks and counting
. very confusing
looks great!!!. keep the updates coming! great job of being quick to update the app and user interface and continuing to add great features!
very user friendly. great app for on the go people
missing some features. should have all the capabilities that the web site has, no reason not too. i can print from my phone so why not print my payroll too? at least viewrun payroll.
great app. haven't had any issues. has helped me run my business from the road!
very useful application. it really helps me stay up to the minute with my business goings on.
really2 great application. i wish i have found this software 8 years back and it can help me save thousand spent on trying many other software
most productive app. using this app on my iphone and ipad hs made my life so much easier! i've been able to invoice my customers without having to lug me laptop around. truly an awesome app!
". i hate it. you can't do ""billable"" expenses from the app. you cant edit invoices that have been sent. terrible. i hate it."
. similar issues as gillian, dashboard blank, constant error messages on mobile. i also ended up accidentally reinstalling a slightly different version and was paying double!! i didn't realize there were two very similar apps!! i also uninstalled reinstalled and it didn't fix issue. i am currently trying to figure out how to recover all the expenses and photo's of receipts for the tax season.
awesome.. would be 5 star if we had a shipping address on mobile version. i love this app make my life so easy. thank you.
. awful app...one of the main reasons for converting to online from desktop was 'receipts on the go'. it's a joke...most of chart of accounts is missing and so are the bank accounts i'm using for transactions! so entering and recording receipts on the go is impossible. if this is important for you, use xero!!
new update crashes every time. new update makes me close and reopen every time for critical app updates
. keep having to login which is annoying. very slow in general. app doesnt update automatically. i have to manually update which takes forever for a relatively small number of changes to be downloaded. after 3 years, still quite disappointed with it.
cannot log into app. cannot log in.
easy to use. this app is so quick and easy. my business is on the go all of the time and it makes estimates and invoicing so quick and easy.
. was working for a couple months. now i can longer link to my bank account and the app constantly freezes with either a blank screen or white screen. completely useless..
the best!. i can't live without my quick books app! better than paying hundreds of dollars for an accountant
works well so far. i installed the app this month. so far it allows me the flexibility to record transactions on the go. this is a big help.
greatest app ever. i love the “capture receipt” feature. makes life a whole lot easier.
. working great. the app makes it easy for me to write receipts and invoices quickly from the field and my clients like having an emailed copy of everything i do.
. i have tried to log on from my tablet and constantly getting an error message not letting me log in even after clearing the cache. also was meant to have a discount at sign up for a few months but charged full price.
great app. this is getting better with each update it makes. i you this app everyday to run my practice and it makes it very convenient because i'm constantly on the road and i don't have to sit at my desk just to enter expenses or send invoices to clients.
app times out occasionally during entry. app times out occasionally while i’m using it. when that happens it deletes the transaction i was working with.
. great app
good app for accounting students. thanks quickbooks team 👍
. it makes life easier!
. i can see my subscription for months. click to manage subscription and i am told i have none. haven't used thus app but have been paying for months. help
. great app. takes a bit of getting used to, but once you are it's really easy
basic business. although it does have obvious business needs covered. it doesn't offer the next step in organization. without the ability to create work orders, or track services performed. it remains a minuscule part of my daily business. it really doesn't have anything that separates itself from other simple invoicing programs or applications. it's cloud based convenience remains the reason for my usage.
movement through fields. i love the app but it takes so much more time than through safari, enter or tab should move through fields looking forward to this fix
few useful features for me. most of the main features i need aren’t in the app. lots of features i never use are in the app. no bill payment, no upcoming bills showing up in checking register like it does on mine. no credit memos.
. inuit customer service is a joke
great piece of kit for small business. i have a small business servicing skis and selling waxes from home, i had to send all my invoices out using a word template, this has streamlined all my admin and accounting processes leaving me more time to work with my customers equipment. highly recommended
great app. quickbooks online works really well, fits my needs as an independent consultant.
. invoicing only works when it feels like. app is very hard to navigate. half the tools i have to log in to my computer and do on the desktop version. very dissatisfied and will be cancelling this service soon as i find a better alternative.
take me back. new updates are awful. keeps crashing..unable to do simple functions on the go such as editing invoice, sending a statement, etc. old version was much better. change it back to how it was..not every update is a good update. especially not this one.
app doesn't connect on ios 9. ever since ios upgrade 9.3 and quickbooks mobile app doesn't sign in, always says check internet connection. it's a bug in the app and they know it, we contacted support to fix it and they said they are working on it and will have a solution by end of may. this problem has been on for more than 4 weeks with no solution. poor app with poor support. not recommended at all.
useless after update. quickbooks was wonderful until the most recent update rendered it useless. things won't save. transactions hang up. very frustrating.
limited functionalty. the app has limited functionality, can't see transaction details of any expenses and income accounts; can only see the assets and was told to use the browser version. can't drill down from a report to see the details of the transactions. touch id login is handy. so it's better to just use the browser version.
best accounting software. best investment made so far on quickbooks and the app just excels... this is really awesome :)
. cannot login from mobile
meh. still not sure how quick books became the market leader and they have been resting on their laurels for years. the app is no exception. there are lots of improvements they could make but they are too lazy.
limited options. i love the app but would l like to be able to fully edit or create new customers and vendors in this app. although it is possible, it isn't as detailed compared to the online desktop version.
nothing adds up. when you run a business you want your numbers correct. i don't have time to troubleshoot why your software can't add a simple paypal balance and leaves transactions out. your fired!
easy to use.. does what i need it to do. helps me record my sales and expenses without a pc.
quickbooks online. fantastic easy way to invoice and keep in touch with customers on the go
. great program once you get used to using it👍
more than convenient, it's necessary. having the app makes it so much easier to do business on the go. you can send estimates and invoices before the client meeting has even ended. efficient and essential!
customer files. sometimes all the estimates and invoices don’t show up in the customers file when i go into it on the app.
. worst experience ever!! do not use this app for payment processing. something they dont tell you is, they will put your funds on hold for 10+ business days and you will have to call 200 times to get them released, and they still won't give you your own money. i run a legitimate art and film business (llc and everything) and have been treated like a criminal. do yourself a favor and go with someone else for payment processing!!!!
handy, but needs work. the app is pretty hand for some of my clients to invoice on the go or take photos of their receipts. i find it a little too dumbed down for my uses. i would love to be able to add delayed credits and charges and drill down on the financial statements. it would also be great to pull other reports, not just p&l and balance sheet.
. very unreliable. get frequent errors trying to edit expenses. ui is clunky and errors all over the place. i don't trust the numbers on the expenses either. actually, the expenses are completely wrong. literally doubled versus the website. what a joke.
. i have called customer support twice now. each time, i am greeted by an overly friendly person who barely speaks a word of english. either time was the agent able to even understand what i am asking for. they could offer no help, they would not transfer me to someone else. i am left all alone here trying to navigate a program and run a business. i have no idea how to get any help from these people. thank goodness for youtube!
gadirepair.com. really a great product at affordable price. smart solutions to all accounting problems.their support team is very responsive and coordinating. i am really impressed with their “reports” i was unable to assess my business stats the way it should be done, thanks to qb for making it so easy for us....👍 great productgreat team i highly recommend every businessman to use it, qb have made it so easy for us. thanks
works great for me!. i love this app! it is nice to be able to create invoices, accept payments, and email invoices on the spot. no more waiting to get back to my computer for data entry.
awful. slow, takes ages to load photos, can only load one photo at a time. constant errors where the invoice will be paid twice
reports needed. need simple reports such as sales tally for a given day. unnecessary steps required for multiple entries, should use 'save and next.'
excellent. i been using quickbooks in various versions since 1996. i upgraded to online in 2015. as i am a working at customers premises, sometimes 15 different a day, the instant invoicing using my iphone saves me having to sit at my office at the end of the day invoicing. another great thing about online is to check any outstanding invoices from customers who request unscheduled visits.
. very efficient and in depth of a record of labor expenses and profit
signature issues. the app crashes every time i get a signature or it doesn't save the signature. please resolve this issue
. great app
super & excellent apps. very user friendly application . i would recommend this software to other people
ótimo!. recomendo!!!
terrible app. you are unable to view and use the register, reconcile accounts and other simple everyday banking tasks. logging into your company through a mobile browser, such as the google chrome app for ipad, does give you access to some but not all tasks. isn't the purpose of online banking to be able to perform all banking from mobile devices?
low rating until the app supports chart of accounts. the app continues to be under developed for functions that are developed in the web interface. the app is excellent for invoices and credit card transactions if you have a merchant account coupled to your qbo account. the camera can be used in app to document your receipts to the cloud and i use it extensively for hotelairfarerental car expenses and they can be attached to invoices when emailing your customers.
. makes things sooo much easier and frees up time! no more sitting in front of a computer all day a couple times a month doing data entrybook keeping. very user friendly app and program. only thing i have to log on to do is mark and sort deposits on the sales end.
easy to use.. easy to use. also like customer options to pay after sending invoice.
no multi currency in app. there is no multi currency function in the ipad app making it useless for entering overseas travel expenses.
signature doesn't work with ios 9. my signature for my invoices that i need to get paid on no longer works with ios 9. still no update!
. this app sucks! i can't even login
. doesn't give the full qbo experience, if it is it's not the same ui
. been using this app for almost a full year was working great, now get error and will not sync data. if it does not get fixed will be forced to move to different accounting solution update; tried your solutions and emailed the error to support multiple times no response. i created another trial account and that one retrieved data no issue. it just wont retrieve data on mobile from my actual company account.
great app!!!. this is a great app for my small business. i can make and send out invoices from my phone. which is great!!
. info lost. i was using the service for my business last year and started in march. in november the app crashed. when it did all my saved receipts mileage and info was lost. i can't even login any longer. when i called they said there is no support for the app except online. so i cant even speak to a rep. so all my info gone and i'm still being charged for a year and a half now for a service that never existed.
excellent app and service.. great product.
good but needs more functionality. this app works good, but needs more features added. for example, i have to go to a browser and log in there in order to add a deposit manually. i know functionality is being added continuously. so i a hopeful that my review can be a 5 star review in the near future.
professional and practical. love this app! makes my business paperwork so much easier!
drafting estimates. when drafting estimates, system should auto save as many times hours of work is erased if you don’t constantly save before stepping away. in addition when you click the description box there should be an undo button in case it grabs all the text and it gets erased by pressing any button in accident. two very simple and logical things.
easy to use. this app is so quick and easy. my business is on the go all of the time and it makes estimates and invoicing so quick and easy.
impressive for mobile. i posted a bad review because of some bugs. i received an immediate response about upcoming updates and a week later it was fixed. i love that level of support. nice app too.
okay. i'm new to doing my own bookkeeping and find this product clunky and not very easy to use. issues with importing transactions and program changing dates and the order compared to the bank. it's not very easy to see what account transfers are moving tofrom. it's hard to distinguish credits for debits. poor customer service. no good summary graphs. slow to attach receipts. multiple clicks to do basic things. cuts off file names if there too long.
. samsung galaxy s4 i rarely give five stars. i dont use this app like i thought i would but may in the future.
incomparable with ipad pro. this app works terrible with ipad pro. basically made this business expense a complete waste as the app and web program useless on the ipad pro. extremely disappointed and frustrated.
. i have used it for 3 years managing my business invoices, cash flow etc. it's great!
pool guy. quickbooks forced me to update from our quickbooks mobile windows invoicing system to quickbooks mobile with only five days notice. this was very poorly planned by quickbooks and put us in a bind. however the new quickbooks mobile online system is truly fantastic and offers many more powerful features and ease of accessibility. recommendation: this app needs the ability to create a monthly statement that i can email from my phone to my customers. currently i can only do this from a laptop.
. something happened past few days keeps crashing, can't open the app.
very easy to use. the app is fantastic as it is very user friendly and has everything i need. i've used myob in the past and that was terrible compared to the quickbooks app; which is in line with the times.
great app. found this app so easy and user friendly for our small business 😃
. effectively useless. crashes after tapping on anything
. i have had this app on my phone for years. i tried opening it and i was told to update the app. so i did. now it will not open. it just keeps telling me to update. i have uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it still does not work. my business is important and this makes me very mad
great app. this is a great app for small businesses.
. quickbooks has made it easier for me to streamline my work load so i spend less time in my office and more time on the job site.
great app. this app is great and easy to use
broken update. your update broke the app.
the best accounting program on the market.. the best on the market
. great app!!!
. apps bad after last update... you can't easily see invoice and or estimate amount anymore, you have to click each invoice & estimate to see numbers... i will be changing program's soon if not fixed.... we need to be able to easily scroll up and down the hundreds of open invoices and see where things are, not open each invoice to get information... way to timeconsuming... can't screenshot what's going on because the update before prohibits this now.... please devs fix
fee increase is a bad deal. fees increased but same services rendered. otherwise it’s a decent app. i’m disappointed that they get people to invest all there invoices and history in app and program then up the fees in them nearly double. can’t trust a company that does that to ya.
. not all the features are in the app. great on the go!
bank transactions not loaded. there are several limitations with this app. but my major issue is the inability to load bank transactions. the connected bank account goes sometimes for weeks or months without the transactions transferred to qb. other times they are uploaded every couple of days. there is no option to upload the transactions manually through the app. i called customer service but no one helped. this makes the phone app pretty much useless.
owner. great app to take of of business anywhere i'm at!
easy to use, instrumental to my business. keep it glitch free please
. i don't like to forcefully create account first. without using application how can i create account. other apps like this type providing use without login so why you requires login first???
. lot of functionality easier than web or desktop app.
this works for me.... i have a hard time keeping up with my invoices but this makes it simple for me to keep track on the move or like right now laying in my bed creating invoices and estimates. this is great.
"useless. i use quickbooks online extensively at my corporate office. this app, and what is available through the ""mobile"" website version of qb online, is useless for getting any work done outside of the office."
couldn't run my small biz without qb. have used for 4 years. always learning new things. have a great customer service  support. very user friendly for us biz owners who don't have a background in billing  payroll.
where the banking. i want to accept transactions while i sit in bed, this app is far from useful without that capability, come on intuit, make the app complete. as is, a total let down!
great program. it handles almost everything a small business needs. best part is, it's very user friendly.
latest update crashing on iphone 7. great improvements in the app. extra features are a great bonus. well done. on iphone 7 the app crashes when upon opening banking is selected. i've reproduced 5 times.
love quickbooks hate new limited invoice styles update. love quickbooks hate new limited invoice styles update
"won't open. download twice. when i try to log in says i ""need to make payment or my account has been canceled"", which isn't true. i open it on my laptop just fine and have automatic payments. what gives?!!"
no more ios 8 support. disappointed that app developers are dropping ios8 support. not everyone upgrades the second apple comes out with a new ios
was an excellent app but...... never had a problem up to a month ago. upgraded my phone to galaxy s7 and now app does not work. this glitch needs to be fixed asap. i rely on this as i'm out in the feild daily.
latest update. the last update has the photo settings all messed up. you can no longer capture a good picture that will send with invoices. it either won’t attach to the invoice or it’s cropped automatically to the point the entire page doesn’t show. needs to be fixed. already looking at other options for my business.
. stupid app crashs more often as than works
. useless. android app does not support in india
awesome app!. this is a smooth and seamless app that allows me to access all of my company needs wherever i am. invoicing in particular is easy, efficient, and professional!
. app doesn't load any files. great app if you like watching it think forever.
. outstanding app!
excellent app for my business. works wonderfully!
. i hate your new update where all i can do it take a picture and its magically submitted and i can't add any of my info that i need linked to that receipt
quick booksamazing app..!. please mail to this id anuhari036@gmail.com excellent app to work...it's really very useful to me...can you please tell how to invoice? thank you quick books for this amazing app!! it's really very helpful..!
great. makes invoices and estimates from phone look right professional. i use the desktop version as well and it would be great if the different versions spoke to each otherwise best solution by far
update terrible. completely broken at this point. searching for a viable alternative
. quickbooks provides all we needs as a small business. their support is always patient and helpful.
. app no longer loads. error returned from client
doesn't sync open bills or invoices. it doesn't show any of my current or closed bills that have been entered for vendors.
quick books app. have been using quick books app for my business for a few months now, and i am very impressed with the package, as it's great value for money. i enjoy being able to use the app on my phone as it offer all the services that i need to be able to quickly raise and send invoices and pull up important info.
loveland ohio small business owner. love quickbooks. new users starting july 2012. it has helped keep things organized and if i mess up or question, which i have, their help people are awesome in working with me to explain or even help me undo my errors. kudos to the team trainers who trained the team and kudos to the team's who are patient with us on the phone calls!!!!
. does as promised, great extension for using quick books on the run. a must have for business over view at a glance. if your pc crashes this is your life jacket!
. this app is simple and really easy to use. makes my job way easier.
works well!. this app does what i need it to do. i'm an electrical contractor and i'm able to do all the bookkeeping myself with just a little help. i like the ability to make invoices on the job, enter receipts at stores, and view the status of customers. i would suggest this for any small business. i use the basic service ($10mth) and it's well worth it.
". does not sync to account. on the home screen it shows i have invoices that are overdue from customers, but when you click on it, it says ""congratulations, no overdue invoices."" useless app"
comments. there is no printing options for mobile printing. we have tu use other app, to print invoices. poor in reports not friendly to do invoices
no supplier invoice. invoices from suppliers can not be captured on the app. you have to log onto the main website  which is extremely slow and cluttered to navigate on a mobile phone.
je. i would like to see journal entry feature added to the mobile app. i use this app as well as the online version for all of my clients. it would be nice to be able to perform all of the same functions no matter which i choose to use.
. great app, user friendly and very versatile!
great app. i have to switch from another accounting software to quickbooks and every thing is easy to use and easy to navigate.i use it on my phone,desktop in the office.i wish i had it ever since i have been using the other accounts software.
absolutely fantastic!. this app is incredible. having been using for 6 months, and it has revolutionised the way we are able to do business. so easy to setup, use and understand. i highly recommend to anyone that needs an easy orderinvoicesales system for their business.
best app. very helpful online support
. just was on hold for 20 minutes and the issue is not resolved. the app is not allowing me to save information. also the online platform is not working with third party apps with the new tax rates in saskatchewan (reciept bank) been waiting for that fix for 3 weeks.
. great app use it to submit all quotes and review estimates
owner. great app nothing more to be said. everything is so organized. i love it!!
keeps crashing in iso 13, can’t even start up. didn’t they have enough time to test before the final release of ios13? minor issues are one thing but the app doesn’t even start, that’s a sev1 that should have been caught long time ago.
. rubbish interface, doesnt send invoices when you press send, had multiple invoices paid late due to this, will be looking for a decent online app to run my business. how can an invoice be overdue if my customer never received it because the app sent it? how do i tell if my estimates have actually been sent? its extremely unprofessional having to contact my customers and ask them if they've recieved invoices and expenses because this software is not up to scratch.
. great app! it gets the job done!
pretty useful!. i can add my expenses and match them later and now they even. updated the web internet so i can use it on my tablet and it's become super helpful! thanks quickbooks! i think what's they update it to where you can do all the thing you can on the tablet web interface that you can do on the computer it's going to be top notch
satisfied customer. i'm a new user of qb app, and like what i see so far. it's easy to use and is a great asset to help keep my finances straight. it's worth the $10 per month.
great app. i run my one person business on quikbooks and i am not a detail person. my clients comment all the time on the ease of payment!! love it love it
. been using this app for almost a full year was working great, now get error and will not sync data. if it does not get fixed will be forced to move to different accounting solution update; tried your solutions and emailed the error to support multiple times no response. i created another trial account and that one retrieved data no issue. it just wont retrieve data on mobile from my actual company account.
simply doesn't work. my companies all use qb online. i access it via browser almost daily. this app routes me to an advertisement to switch to qb online, even if i use the admin credentials. i'll assume it's something with all of my accounts and not a shameless advertising plug.
very good!. great app  i love the upgrades.
no support for canadian tax system. intuit's quickbooks for web does not support the canadian tax system. not sure why this app is appearing in the canadian app store.
. 1 star due to being conned by the sales staff. downloaded app and was offered 50% reduction if i signed up. next day get a call from quickbooks sales team saying they could offer the price lower for 12 months, signed up and looked at the offer on the app was lower. its a good tool but sales obv just want to meet their targets
. need user mode in apps
good for basics, missing key items for on the go. the app does the basics, but i typically run into issues getting exactly what i need. have to use the full online version for truly running the business
still can't create po's through app. i use quickbooks for 2 things mainly. to create estimatesinvoices and send pos once the invoice has been paid. i can't create po's with the app so it's useless. i have to go to the website every time i want to create a po. it makes no sense that they would leave this feature out.
love the app. very fast an easy
slow, expensive and with poor support. i have been using quckbooks for a year now. it's terribly slow on here and also on the pc, the support is dire, and mostly just does not respond. the only thing that happens quickly in this app is the removal of service if you fail to pay your subscription. avoid! now i'm looking for an alternative that i can migrate my business info etc to without too much fuss.
. keeps crashing when entering receipts. it's infuriating. updated review 6 months later still crashes when splitting an expense. tried deleting the cache. it's useless.
. good app and easy to use.
. switch to xero even though its more expensive. better off wasting money on a useless app. cant even save a transaction. lousy support and engineering team to not resolve such a essential feauture after 1 month. subscribe at your own risk.
. easy to use, very good app to invoice an manage the accountant anywere
affordable truck repair inc.. great app, makes it very easy for us to keep track of our books.
terrible experience with customer support. we had terrible experience with customer support. for a very important issue we contact qb customer support team, we wait for 6 days an never respond our request. for this incident we can't bill our invoices. we hate our experience. consider customer support if your company needs help.
drat! not even close. this has no more functionality than the mobile ap, very disappointing! access to the banking tab & registers to make and receive payments, along with access to the entire vendor tab & reporting would be helpful. i am not sure why intuit focused its efforts on creating an app that imports images & info from social networking sites intead of focusing on making better functionality of what it actually takes to run a business.
. love doing invoices and estimates right on the phone
jason. great app, but the online version needs progressive invoicing, fix that and its 5 star!
. software works ok and only ok. however the monthly price seems to have gone up exponentially for no reason over the last 2 years. edit: changed from 3 stars to 1 star thanks to the developer's response.
. the app is useless. google sign in simply doesn't work. links to my invoices still open in browser even when i have the app installed.
o melhor app. o melhor app para gestão empresarial simplesmente nunca usei algo parecido
. great app once you get logged in. repeatedly returns to login screen after entering correct password when using google login.
mostly great!. at the moment qb's mobile won't work. some kind of trouble with company data downloading. hopefully fixed soon.. otherwise good and handy app.
crashes when trying take credit cards. crashing when trying to take credit card payments. not very helpful.
useless. i am an avid qbo for ie customer for many years, but this ipad app is useless. can't do anything with it, and can not see banking info, the most important thing in accounting! if you want to view customervendor names that can be done, but you can't work in this app. view only.
fake claim. i am not sure why these companies feel like they have use false advertising to sell their products. i do get it. i understand that some companies, usually the big ones, feel like they have to recoup development costs for their apps. well just be honest then
. great app and very simple to use. just what my construction company needed to be legit
. its a big help sending invoices
quickbooks online. works well once you get use to the change from the desktop program.
gret app. i love this app but the reason i didn't give it a 5 is because when you enter an expense with the app and write who you paid and save the expense when you go to the computer it does not show who you paid. that field is blank.
crabbywyatts llc. great tool has made my life easier.
the best invoice app. very simple to use and helps a lot! i recomend
". 6.10.19  i hate it. you can't do ""billable"" expenses from the app. you cant edit invoices that have been sent. terrible. i hate it. 8.12.19  still hate it. noone has ""investigated""my situation. 👎👎"
. this is my first year using quickbooks. so much easier to track all expenses and sales.
wonderful app!!!. couldn't sing the praises high enough. i run a small, single member managed llc and the quickbooks online app is everything i need. i can create and send invoices and sales receipts on the go, even have the customer sign right on my iphone or ipad.
. good app
. not a bad app
very good!. really does help to keep everything at your finger tips, it's a convenient way to keep track of your earnings and invoices. one quick glance and you know where your company is at! 👍🏻
intuitive. great app! love it!
rather use my local accountant and pay the £100 per annum. rather use my local accountant and pay the £100 per annum
great!. versatile and wonderful app
. it's ok for invoicing other than a few issues with dates. but i'd like to know why supplier transactions entered as a 'bill' through the desktop app don't show up in the mobile app, but 'expenses' do.
. rubbish interface, doesnt send invoices when you press send, had multiple invoices paid late due to this, will be looking for a decent online app to run my business. how can an invoice be overdue if my customer never received it because the app sent it? how do i tell if my estimates have actually been sent? its extremely unprofessional having to contact my customers and ask them if they've recieved invoices and expenses because this software is not up to scratch.
amazing app. i love this app makes everything easier for me and faster. this app is amazing i just love it!
flawed. i am going to reinstall the old app. the new app will not allow me to add a customer from my phone's contact list.
great addition to the business. this app couples great with my at home business. love it!
easy accounting for nonaccountants. i am not an accountant by training, so many of the concepts were foreign to me when i first started using quickbooks. however the simple format, and easeofuse made it an easy transition for me to do most simple accounting techniques. i was able to quickly use it and soon it became an essential business analysis tool and essential for forecasting and trending.
"can't create account. hi, i'm new to this app and so i've been trying to create a new account. i've filled in all the required details and pressed ""create account"" ,but that's when a window pops up saying, ""missing 'content type' "". and because of that i haven't been able to create an account. please help me, it's been 2 days already since i've installed the app and i really want to be able to explore the great functions of this application!"
so many glitches. this program glitches at least once a month. today it is telling me we don't have an account. so frustrating. it's great when it works, but it should always work.
whatsapp on iphone. the experience is very good with quick books on iphone. but it is not connecting directly to whatsapp while sending the invoice. the invoice have to be first downloaded into the folder and later it has to be sent.
qbo app. useless app, does not present a desirable layout compared to the the online version, in the banking area, to the bank register. somewhat comparable to using another account program.
organized. been in business for 20 years and been using this app for a year. love it. still lots beyond my abilities and i wish there was a little more help in the app for the accounting inept like me but i just bring the app to my accountant and they can pull all the data needed. recommend it. see sales, cost, accounts receivable at any given moment.
stay well away!. worst software i have used to date. zero customer service. ignores all complaints. takes forever to load. constant problems. not user friendly.
so far so good 👍🏻😃. software is straight forward and easy to use and if you are unsure, the support team explain everything.
new to quickbooks. i decided to switch my established business from square to quickbooks and so far i have no complaints. it’s fairly easy to use. the only thing i’m currently waiting on is for my transactions to clear and be deposited which takes about a week since i’m new. should be a breeze after that.
. great app
. terrible, ended up deleting it. so buggy that you can't save expenses.
good but not free. 30 day free trial 😣
room for improvement. it’s a good app, with some good features, perfect for using on your phone. it would be nice, however, if the ipad version was more like the web version with more of the features available there. it’s frustrating having to switch between the two versions.
for the money this app is terrible. this app does not seem to sync in real time. for example an invoice setup on online quickbooks does not show here. even the customer that was added online. for a large company making millions of dollars on these products it is not only unacceptable but it is also fundamentally wrong
. well after the experience so far it's great when i need to merge all apps at home then i can rate better. customer service has been just awesome so far. thanks
veryy unhappy. i have a flooring company where i give discounts for different reasons. i am upset that i can not add a discount nor does it give me the option to add it to tge invoice pleade fix it immediately
. its great experience
. amazing been using it for 5 years now. makes doing taxes a lot easier!
no way to categorize transactions. no way to access bankcredit card accounts to categorize transactions. what's the point of having the profitloss tab if that's the case??
. i love the app so much, but if can add more function n reports in mobile app then is really perfect:) 23092019 i wish to ask, wether you can remove the function which not allowed to screenshot ? it is very frustrated when i need to inform my customer how much they owe. please !!!
. dreadful experience so far. bought qb 16th dec 2019 and cant get a call back from an english speaker to help me with set up despite multiple attempts! why is sales uk based but support isnt? this is 2nd review  1st disappeared!!! so disappointed and very desperate to get started. i can login to qb online but says im in usa not uk. i have emailed you twice now. still no reply.
great as an assistant to the desktop version.. i've found this app to be a great mobile partner to the full desktop (or online) version. there's a couple functions that aren't available in the app but everything you do need is easily available. i can't connect my bank account because my (non us) bank isn't listed but being able to input expenses as they happen is a great way of keeping updated accounts. reconciliation is a breeze afterwards. it's a great app.
. we tried the free trial before purchasing.. quick books keeps changing my partially paid invoice to paid in full .. when i called tech support he told me to fix this problem its 129.00he was rude and started to raise his voice after i started hows it possible i have to pay that much for a free trial app when they are the ones causing the problem... quick books is no good.. and their tech support is the rudest customer service i've ever heard!
iphone app is the worst. the iphone app doesn't work. their customer service people admitted it doesn't work. don't even try to use it  too frustrating and a big waste of time. online version and ipad versions are good but too limited for price  reports can't compare year over year
useless for mobile access. doesn't have any of the features you would expect from a mobile app. if you want to do anything other than create a invoice or view transactions you put in from your desktop, its a waste of time. no balances, no accounts, nothing useful at all.
i love this better than their computer program!!!!. i love this app better than my computer program they have, it's easier to use & easier to track your expenses & sales. i recommend this to all my friends that basically run their business out of a vehicle saves on extra work when you get home.
. app start hi nahi ho raha he,add company karte hi restart ho jata he
when i am done, i am done!. as a contractor i love to do my estimates one time, hit convert to invoice one time, hit receive payment one time and i am done with my paperwork and money is heading my way before i leave the job site. when i get home i can just spend time with the family rather than swim through paperwork. great service!
great & uptodate!. this is a great little app to give you access into the back end of your quickbooks online account. great for doing simple invoicing and adding expenses. i still use the desktop browser for more complicated reports and such. well done and intuit keeps the app up to date thank you!
. dont bother if you dont have access to pc or laptop.basic features like editing customer email is not available on mobile devices including tablets.if an invoice isnt sent because the recipient email address sends it back,you have no way of knowing that an error has occurred even when attempting to check via any web browser.caused me £1000's of cashflow headache. contacted customer support,got a nonsensical response.made it sound like the problem is an actual feature of the app and software.
. game changer. invoicing and tracking expenses just got so easy. it's amazing, and i am only sad i didn't know about it sooner!
. great app to manage all paper work and finance.
nicely integrated. this app integrates really well with quickbooks online account. features get added regularly.
. says an update is available and exits, while an update doesn't exist. given how overpriced qbo is, would be nice if the android app worked...and was half as nice as the ios equivalent.
great app. love that i can get estimates approved right on my phone!
the best app thus far.. i use this for my business and it was a blessing in disguise. thanks qb for helping me organize my books.. even my accountant was impressed.
feed. need to be able to change from sales receipt to invoice without canceling and starting over. would also be nice if every few months we didn’t have to delete and reinstall
. my go to business app...always works great.
. doesn't do what the advertisements say it does. and the app has so many bugs on my new pixel it's not worth it.
". won't allow me to update ""company information"", so customer invoices and receipts show the wrong information displayed. not a way to run a business, only track p&l. disappointing."
. quickbooks online is great, but the app does not include much for keeping your business mobile. all the small things really upset me, such as not showing inventory quantity on hand in the app. i'll just keep using the web browser until the app is up to par.
rubbish. i need to see my bills.
. this app doesn't allow me to add expenses. please fix it. thank you.
. it's a great app for the phone.
. great accounting program thanks!
19.11.2 awful update. first thing i noticed was there is no search bar for customers, so i have to scroll through thousands of customers to find the one i’m looking for. secondly, i had hoped that we’d be able to view estimates and invoices in landscape mode to see them better, nope. then, when i tried to navigate back to the main customer list, there’s no back button! this version was nowhere near ready to be released.
really useful. great app allowing me to raise invoices whilst on site, confirm details with clients and syncs with the software back at the office.
good app but. it’s a good app but you should be able to mark invoices as paid and deposited via the app. my paid invoices are regularly, incorrectly shown as unpaid. i have to wait until i have time to go on my laptop and mark them as paid via the website
. app is crashing as soon as it starts... 🙄
does everything i need!. love it!
broke!. worked perfect but for some reason it doesn't at at all anymore. crashes at login. i have deleted and reinstalled same issue. this is costing me time and money. really stinks.
. it's great being able to update invoices on site with customers right there to make sure they understand charges and such!
quite decent. works well for me so far.
customer name. can't see contact name but i can see fax # who uses that please fix so we can ss the contact persons name on page with phone # this should be an easy fix
i love it!. works great! love the accessibility, i use the app to send invoices easily while i'm on the go and my clients can pay online, through the invoices i send them. definitely worth every penny!!
"it was good no it's just horrible. i used to be able to update my invoices from my phone and now it just locks me out. it also used to show when customers viewed my invoices but now it keeps saying ""it might not be up to date"". after 7 years with them. i'm going to find a new pos at the beginning of the year."
can't log in on nexus 5x. i haven't been able to log in on my nexus 5x for 23 months (maybe longer). i can get to the login screen and put in my credentials, but when i click next it errors. tried uninstalling and reinstalling. even installed a qb app update recently if i remember correctly. still can't log in. tried emailing info to support, but i still have the same problem. i can login from my computer or ipad mini just fine.
waste of time. don't bother, it doesn't work and they could not care less!!!
this app is worthless. literally none of the things i routinely do with quickbooks is possible with this app.
great app. works well for small to medium size businesses on the go!
great app. highly recommend this app to anyone with a small business or a business that's on the go. i switched over from quickbooks desktop to quickbooks online and it's way better for me.
great app!!. this app helps me stay connected to my office while being out on jobsites. i can check customer invoices from previous jobs to see what process was done. great app.
. after new update app stuck on dashboard. unable to perform work on app. please fix this issue
ceo of gd2k. this is a really good app it has help our business in so many ways. it help boost our profit margin we have been able to close deals, and make invoices right on the spot. i recommend this for a lot of different business with quickbooks online.
. app isn't working. i keep getting an error message while it's loading.
must have. this app is an all around life saver for the on the go business minded person! freedom to work on the go!! absolutely love it!
. very efficient, very useful
a very useful application. i find it quite convenient to be able to enter expenses from my phone and include photographs receipts when i am on the go. i use quickbooks online and although the app is limited in some respects as far as functionality goes the limits that other reviewers have discussed has not affected my business at all. i like it a lot :)
. can't connect my bank account. please fix this error. i have to manually put my expenses in the app because when i try connecting my bank account i always get a pop up saying an error occurred.
small business owner. it's fantastic and professional for service contracting for management, but the fact that the crew in the field still use paper carbons to submit & clients want paper makes this a major problem. if the client doesn't give an email, or the field crew doesn't get the right info, i end up spending extra hours trying to figure it out...
no es para argentina. bien pero no pude incluir los bancos
this mobile version sucks. you can't do all the things you need to make the forms as you can on your computer. and if you have the old online version on your computer do not update to the new version you'll likely wish you hadn't.
. qb desktop has a far superior user interface i did not realize that this is not the same program
great app would be useful to do bills on it though. reminder email doesn't work on app
. it does everything i need it to, customer service is really helpful when you're learning how to use it, and the convenience of accessing your books anywhere anytime is exactly what a busy person needs.
". won't allow me to update ""company information"", so customer invoices and receipts show the wrong information displayed. not a way to run a business, only track p&l. disappointing."
stay well away!. worst software i have used to date. zero customer service. ignores all complaints. takes forever to load. constant problems. not user friendly.
". the app failed to associate my quickbooks online account with the app at login. ""it seems like you have an account with intuit but no quickbooks online company associated with : my@email would you like to create a company?"" additionally, when trying to troubleshoot this issue, i was given the run around through all services... from faqs, to online support, to calling directly. issue still unresolved."
add receipt photos!!!. please this feature is desperately needed. you did it for the self employed app why not for this more expensive version???
. vary user friendly, takes awhile to learn all the ins and outs but a lot better then the old ways still. great for a small business.
no app support for time activity. come on quickbooks! no time activity entry in the app?! ridiculous!
was enjoying it until ios13 update. this app was working fine until i updated to ios13...... boom! nothing now. crashes on opening everytime.
great app only downfall is.... i like the app the only downfall is if your an employee you can't track your hours on here like you can with the qb on a computer.. also you can't delete a payment if you see you already added it. if so idk how to do these things.
highly recommend for startups. qbo does everything that i need it to. it is a great dashboard to see where i am at, with the ability to add details to all of my transactions.
quick books. your small business fiance organization and report app.do all your small business tasks from here.
keeps crashing in iso 13, can’t even start up. didn’t they have enough time to test before the final release of ios13? minor issues are one thing but the app doesn’t even start, that’s a sev1 that should have been caught long time ago.
. improve ur app i clear all my data buy in app its still coming
. as an accountant it is a handy app to have installed on your phone.
awesome app. feature rich and also user friendly
great job!. now i know when an invoice has been emailed. very complete app! now we just need a bulk action.
not enough. can’t do everything from app. they say it’s better, but it can’t be if i can’t access everything i need, makes the app pointless.
making life easy. qbs has enabled me as an absolute novice to business manage the financials of all components of my business. the ability for my accountant to look in and assist were necessary and conduct tax admin such as bas preparation has been such a relief. making life easy in small business is a welcome capability.
take time to learn it. be patient
. you have priced me out. i'm going to find another program. $40 a month is ridiculous.
. just starting out with quickbooks. i noticed that it lets me know whether an account holder has seen my invoice. nice! i'd like a little more guidance on using it to track my money, though. i feel a little in over my head.
unable to process simple request. crashing and getting an error saying data unavailable. can’t even save one expense
not many useful features...yet(?). no access to trial balance or p&l reporting. no access to cash balances. no report writing or report generating capabilities. i guess it's free, but i hope there is a robust pipeline of upcoming features.
. quick, simple, much less hassle than the old way of doing things.
business smooth. great app. keeps my business organized and in my hand.
. edit 12319: thanks for the fix and newer versions. this app has been updated and expanded to be a powerful tool on the go. crash problem fixed. love qbo i love that this app is a limited version of the qbo for your desktop browser: however, it crashes on start up all the time rendering it useless.
great small business tool. excellent on a laptop, doesn't handle banks with authentication dongles very well, mobile app doesn't handle them at all. can't do payroll from mobile. receipt tracking is easy and works well. reports and snap shots handy.
awesome service & tool. worth spending time and effort to set it up once. makes accounting really simple and reports provide valuable insights.
best accounting app i've used. this makes my business run smooth and conveniently, i hope they bring more functionality to it still.
. log in issues and it stopped tracking my mileage on its on. i'm trying to pull my information for my taxes and it will not let me log on. more than frustrating, i want my money back!!!! and yes i have tried reinstalling the app!
new business.. very user friendly. almost like apple designed it. very unhappy that the email function doesn’t work. many people have complained for over a year and quickbooks still hasn’t offered a fix😠. i have to take a screenshot and copy and paste to my email. not as professional looking, but gets the job done. that one glitch took away two stars because i can’t use my mobile phone to give someone an invoice or estimate.
. fantastic and very simple to use
use it to view only. very handy to look at information. do not use it to enter information.
a handy little companion but it wont replace the website. a number of features from the web portal are missing such as matching bank transactions but its ok to use simply to check your chart of accounts and to record expenses.
. after some training it is clear that quickbooks is an invaluable tool for business. after using other cloud invoicing software who have either not covered my needs or have closed down i would hope that qb will be around for the long haul . downgraded by 1 star because the recipt capture isnt quite as good as another app i had .
. this is a great app, once you figure it out. it is best to have a working knowledge of accounting, or at least how to keep and balance a checkbook. there are many features. some you won't need, but could come in handy as you grow a business. i found the app helps. if you don't forget to use it. keep your receipts. duh.
ipad perfect until ios 8.5. app hasn't worked since 8.5 update. have sent several request about the app crashing and no one has gotten back to me. i've deleted and redone loaded, rebooted ipad, etc. when not crashing it's a 5 star app. please fix asap!
very nice app. very easy to use and make my all estimates and invoices very smooth and keep the updates very soon
changed my rating to 5.. i used to upload all my account transactions from this app. now they are gone. that was the only thing i used the app for. it is now useless to me. ***update*** your suggestion worked. changed my rating.
. sweet app this is a sweet app for my small business
slow to load and outdated info. the mobile app is pretty much useless, continues to give outdated balances, the only report available is a basic p&l. i need to see a running balance, not just the bottom line which is usually wrong but no way to check! i see many updates but no improvements, only rate increases!
good app. very detailed , im no pro @ accounting but i am teaching myself this app. its very in depth and i like it.
. good . highly recomended,. the only thing is i need to register the time of the day the transaction was made. that's give me more control of my routes.
love this app. great app would recommend to everyone.
easy and userfriendly always available. i've only worked with quickbooks desktop version. so far i have been using this for a week it allows me to do invoices on the fly. and i can check my staff input at any time, very handy would recommend to anyone. especially small business!
very helpful. this ap has been great with my ipad! being able to enter receipts and attach a photo right from the camera is the best! i love having the ease of bookkeeping on a smaller device that i can take with me everywhere.
easy and efficient!. the app serves perfectly to capture transactions on the go, snap a pic and enter amount and accounts then review later if needed on a computer. simple, some people expect this to be fully functional for some reason; if you need a fully functional program then you really should have the appropriate expenses towards computers and software anyways. this app makes the book keeping process easy as cake for clients and the accountant.
no good color and texture of sreen. it hard to seen no c olor in photos
. use qb for all my book keeping, estimates and invoices.
". ""get paid faster"" is a lie. it is intuit policy to hold funds for 6 days for your first credit card transaction and, at their discretion, any transaction after that."
app not working on iphone. i’ve been trying to install the app on my iphone (6s) with the current version of ios for the past couple of months. the app downloads and installs. when i tap the app to open it, the screen briefly shows the intuit quickbooks logo and then closes. i called support but the told me to go to apple. the ability to use the app to capture receipts etc was a big draw to using quickbooks online. very disappointed.
organization. finally found a way to do things faster and keep me organized!! with qb app i can easily go into my account and make an invoice, pay a bill, and add my deposits as soon as i do them without waiting until i'm in my office to do everything.
great app. yet again another update and even more glitches, you charge a fortune and cannot provide a decent service  i’m considering switching to a competitor as you have breached the contract that you have with me. this needs fixing urgently and you need to refund subscription fees! my advice to businesses and the selfemployed is do not use quickbooks!
. still lots for me to learn so cant say 5 out if 5
user friendly. love quickbooks still getting used to everything it offers
. app crashes every time i try to go into banking section. have kept giving it a go over last 12 months as desktoponline versions are brilliant but mobile version still crashes
not good. crashes often; slow; give frequent error messages.
. love this app
. please make a simple way of uploading a photo to an invoice (instead of through create note option).
"not as good as it was.. getting worse. incorrect allocation of funds to invoices. the mobile app doesn't allow expense entering anymore (""we're working on it""  november 16). yes, you can see invoices and forward from the phone, but wouldn't want to do anything else. come on qb, get your act together. u.k."
. easy to use, simple and the lack of paper is a plus
awful, just awful. doesn't even show taxes or vat, you have to log on with a desktop browser for that. wish i’d signed up for another accounting app.
. extremely slow. no it not slow wifi no it's not the device note 10 it's just a slow app
brockton driving school. great app, keeps my business manageable on the go.
new version stinks. one of the main reasons i use the app is so that i can pull up my customers entire transaction history when i'm out in the field. the previous version did that beautifully. other problems as well.
two factor log in broken. can't log in since the app was updated, it just crashes after i enter my login details
whyyy. why on earth would any app ask dor my banking information and password etc theres an api for those theres absolutely no way for me to share my password with anyone or anything... zero stars
review. love quick books but feel very much alone when it comes to new stuff or thinks i need help with it would seem to me that qb think that everyone as the same knowledge level as they do and a diary like the original one with barclays bank would be very useful
great app. time saver for small business owners
good app. no complains
work done sheets. this is good. could there be a work sheets which can carry information like cossh, removals of waste, costs of material and work done which could be added dates gps photo to the invoice. i really think this would make this program the best. cheers tim
quickbooks. works great . happy with the app
discount. one of the best accounting software on the market. the only think that maybe can be added is the discount feature on the invoice.
. as a company you are charging too much to have such a lousy application. you can't make any invoices with android phones, it keeps giving me 'error' messages even after uninstalling and installing it a couple of times.
getting better. they've agressively added functionality over the past year...becoming a more complete app!
limited usefulness. app is fairly thin on functional features. if you aren't doing invoices might as well go to the real website instead.
no problems. just a decent easy tool for your business which will save on time and money. can’t complain!!
. great app , looking forward to getting the full version.
bugs and bugs it a jungle. need to be able to email multiple emails at one time.
. you can use this app for small business
never worked. downloaded app but it has consistently failed to open. only the message 'unfortunately quickbooks online has stopped'. tried all the suggested work rounds, uninstall, clear data, clear cache. called help centre and their agent couldn't have been any more disinterested. appalling customer service. not worth subscribing. dreadful service.
. bit slow !!! otherwise i love it...
love the desktop version. the app needs work.. limited functionality. i can't even update the credit card i use to pay quickbooks in the app. tough to send invoices to clients
can not save estimates. i'm able to imput items for estimates but error message pops up when i try to save.
great invoicing app. works great for invoicing needs.
. for over a week, the app has been failing to load my account details. i sent the error report by email too. i am using the correct login info and i have a samsung galaxy s10 plus. the app is poorly designed and maintained... spending all the money on those commericalsads vs on the actual product, not looking to renew once our lisence expires at this rate... we can just build our own system instead or use other functioning ones..
. best accounting software! worst customer service ever!!!! hold times are hours & when you finally get a person, which is a miracle, they get offended if your upset & will hang up on you!they do not want to help you, just keep you trapped in their maze paying that monthly (rediculous) price! all they want is your money! & will hold your important business info & data entered as ransome. *horrible business practice*
. this app has helped its tracked and it's made things with my accounts look like i know what i'm doing
. has potential but hasn't let me update any transactions since day one. tells me to try back in a few hours. not the best way to run a business budget. update: it's been a week and still broken. performed all the suggestions in the response article. update 2: yeah did email them like you asked. still waiting for a reply...
. sole trader; i was spending hours on spreadsheets before finding this app. it has frozen a couple of times at inopportune moments but overall great. the ability to create a purchase order on my phone is the only missing link so far. 5 stars!
changed my business. this app has worked wonderfully. it fills the role of a second employee. accounting has never been so easy for both myself and for my clients to complete their bill.
very pleased. very happy
incomplete. the mobile app is not very useful compared to the online version, missing so many functions! like time sheets and billing be with them!
no multi currency = useless. i enabled multicurrency on my quickbooks account, which you can not revert once applied. and now i find that when i log into the app, it won’t show transactions or customers that use anything other than my base currency. useless. utterly useless.
. pretty good app. lots of features like asset register need to be accessed through desktop. ocr not available for receipts on this version
"buggy, issues with sync. for some reason this app is constantly having connection issues for me. i get messages like ""transaction not accepted"". then i have to log into the desktop version to actually do the work. ok for a glance but not useful for productivity."
. useless app. waste of money. lousy support. subscribe at your own risk. i am cancelling mine
. greeat app love you guys and ladies from all the products of quickbooks
basic business. although it does have obvious business needs covered. it doesn't offer the next step in organization. without the ability to create work orders, or track services performed. it remains a minuscule part of my daily business. it really doesn't have anything that separates itself from other simple invoicing programs or applications. it's cloud based convenience remains the reason for my usage.
great app. quickbooks have a fantastic app with full functionality of the browser version.
disappointing. i've been a longtime user of the desktop version of quickbooks for the past 20 years and just recently switched to quickbooks online. i was really looking forward to managing my company's expenses, print checks, and enter bills from my new ipad. i am terribly disappointed in the complete lack of features available in this app. it's actually completely useless and a waste of memory. how could intuit release such a piece of garbage such as this?
. good app. always improving.
always good. i have been in business since 1997 and i have always used quickbooks, this is the first time i have used quickbooks online. it was simple to set up my accounts. as always, i love you guys over there.
love it. business owner love this app
. it won't sync with my account and often won't open. update: after emailing my info to the email they responded with, i never heard back. i also called and was told that they'll work on it and email me. haven't heard yet, maybe next week.
step in the right direction. took intuit quite a while to develop this product. glad to see that they made something for the ipad. this however is still very limited as far as employees, printing check, payroll things like that. but it's a step in the right direction. keep working on it!
. great app but how does it stand out?
not great. there are multiple problems wrong with this program. you can't bill a customer when you attach a receipt which means i constantly have to switch between devices. my expenses according to the customer are incorrect. i'd like to see my estimateinvoice minus my expenses per job. the only reason i switched to this program from freshbooks, which is way less expensive and more user friendly is because quickbooks has a balance sheet, which our accountant required.
fab. brilliant app that updates instantly, giving a visual handle on your business at any time. thank you
weak iphone app, no customer service. really weak app, no customer service. after trying to contact qb customer service, i got no response from anybody at qb. after paying big monthly fees $ i'm switching back to invoice2go, where i got great customer service and my feedbacks were used in improvements.
. the app offers no simple means to cancel your account should you wish to do so. their help desk also seems eager to push you off on to other, equally unhelpful venues. they also informed me that once i manage to cancel my account (if even possible) they will continue to hold on to my personal information, defeating the point of cancelling an account.
unsatisfied. keeps telling me to contact support after trying to make an invoice very frustrating.
great app. 👍🏼
. great app!
. mobile app runs faster than desktop app. easy to use.
nogo on ipad pro. doesn't look good on ipad pro and doesn't support split screen. need to be able to have qb open on one side and my project system on the other to create invoices.
very nice app. very easy to use and make my all estimates and invoices very smooth and keep the updates very soon
small business owner. app has shut down before i could save and i had to start over in the field. i had trouble accessing it in the beginning. it is not easy to add an address to the invoice edit option for the template...
great app. great for small business but it's a little on the expensive side
. ne fonctionne plus depuis hier
the website & app can not connect. i input the expenses transaction in my computer website (put all the details) and when i opened the apps on my iphone, all my transactions called (no category) what should i do? alrdy delete & reinstalled tho.
garbage. this app is junk!! support for this app is useless looks like i will be going back to freshbooks, it may not be a accounting solution but at least it works and i can import my info without manually entering. my business doesn't have time for me to spend hours with support when i need to be taking care of my customers ms support
. maybe it's my phone but the app runs incredible slow!
qb needs to hire a ux person. how convoluted can a simple task be? try quickbooks. or if you value your time, get expensify.
. very easy and convenient!
. doesn't have a way to track milage like qb self employed. we pay more money and get less features. qb is more concerned about segmenting the market to make more money than providing the best products. beware of qb scams and desire to gouge your pocket book.
it just made my business easy. thanks qb and my brother mohit. a very good app for every startup and and firm.
terrible, embarrassing. after purchasing and downloading the app, it worked fine on day 1. tried to open it and show it off...it would not open. the next day, i gave it another chance. i successfully created an invoice template and then tried to edit a service. the app then froze. i will obtain a full refund and never give this another look.
keep crashing. after last update keep crashing. new update came just an hour ago still same crash???!!!doesn’t launch the app. please fix asap pleasseeee
mr. o'neal. great program.
"finally. my clients can take pictures of their cash receipts and upload so i don't have to worry about an audit. i'm a qbo certified user so ""i"" know how to use it, but it's friendly enough that they can too. thanks."
over all good app. it would get 5* if the invoices showed more details about the bill. like individual dating for services done. that way the customer better understands the invoices.
. great app! easy to use.
won't install.. all i get is an error message.
excellent product. great for sending estimates and invoices on the go. everything i need to see right at my fingertips and very user friendly.
great app.. great app
. i am able to organize my expenses.
👍. very good app, i'm so happy with it!!
horrible. crashes every time. horrible customer service. move on to another app.
love it!!!. i am a tile contractor and use this app everyday. i love the latest update where the customer can sign the estimate.
. just awful. i never know if or when it will work properly. i've uninstalled and reinstalled, tried with and without wifi, this app has cost me a lot in time and money. i never know what it will screw up next and support has never once been helpful in solving issues
. great app
. love this app.... only two things that i can't figure out. first, will not let me have a service date when making an invoice. most important, cannot figure out how to get it to accept the online payments thru ipn. on the desktop version it is highlighted on the invoice and in the email when its sent. other than those two issues, this app is great. would love to use this daily!
. ease of use. ability to send professional estimatesinvoices from anywhere. the ability to load price list makes creating estimates and invoices easy.
o melhor!. excelente!!! minha ferramenta de gestão financeira.
. not supported android mobile in india. software means that either o mobile or computer should work equally both places, but your software has only web version then how to use your software.
awful. it's so confusing i hate it can't seem to manually enter stuff have to download from hsbc but other accounts i use ie trade card & fuelgenie aren't recognised so it refuses to set up & let you enter stuff manually. i so much preferred to enter everything manually you know where you are with this i haven't a clue it's all over the place. i want old fashioned quickbooks that was easy and understandable this is a joke.
extremely disappointingfrustratingnon user friendly. qb online has been very disappointing. the quickbooks apps for ipad and iphone are incapable of accomplishing anything. it has been very very frustrating and i would not recommend.
mr. nice app
. this app is extremely easy to use and keeps all of my business accounting running smoothly and quickly. i haven't had any problems and neither have any of my customers.
. been using this app for almost a full year was working great, now get error and will not sync data. if it does not get fixed will be forced to move to different accounting solution update; tried your solutions and emailed the error to support multiple times no response. i created another trial account and that one retrieved data no issue. it just wont retrieve data on mobile from my actual company account.
. easy and quick to use for estimates, invoices , receipts and keep track of expenses and income
. this website is terrible and the customer service is friendly yet not helpful!!! i want to cancel my subscription and yet told to remove the app from my tablet....wrong by removing the app it does not cancel my subscription...very unhappy!!
quickbooks online. i wish the app was easier and more full functional but then the whole online product is sorely lacking relative to the old offline product. saas makes such a difference for smbs but intuit has missed the boat on the cloudbased solution. ugh!!
broken after update. not updating customer data, crashing, please fix it, i have a business to run!
highly recommend. as an accountant, i use quickbooks everyday on a variety of clients. i wouldn’t recommend any other software. the cloud based platform is ideal for ease of access and management.
new to qb on line. brilliant package but did need support on getting the data i migrated over sorted. but worth the monthly charges. great job quick books.
very convenient. i love this app. with the pay now option im able to get paid before i even had a chance to get back to the office.
limited. for alot of the functionality of qbo you need to use the web app anyway so i would not bother with this app.
. works pretty well. would be nice if you could customize invoices.
doesn't support timesheet entry. i have an account through my employer that is only used to enter timesheet information. this works great through the quickbooks online website from my pc, but when i try to log in through the app it tells me that i do not have a quickbooks online subscription.
can't even register. server error when creating company 1000x sgxs5 + sgxts (lollipop)
great app for busy employersemployees. your features are reduced and it's not the exact same as when you use a pc but it is still really nice. i would not be want it to be as in depth anyways it's nice and simple. i would recommend it to anybody that needs quickbooks on the go. we do a lot of work in the field and it is really nice to do estimates and email them to the customer while standing right next to them.
ok app. easy to setup. big difference between windows version and ipad version. like the amount of critical info showed. on the windows version all critical info is shown. on the iso device not enough info shown. like cash sale,
"problematic app. upon originally downloading this app i was pleased. for the first 24hrs. i was impressed. then, i ""sent"" an invoice which the customer never received. next, it failed to update or sync with my account. when i attempted to update manually it chronically reported an error sighting that i should check my internet connection. frustrated, i uninstalled and reinstalled the app. now, it doesn't stay open for long before saying it stopped unexpectedly. i've reported every error without receiving any feedback."
good app.. appreciate improvements made over the years. would prefer ability to create and edit invoices in detail.
very confusing interface. i'm using this because of convenience, not usability. customizing your forms is excruciating at best. auto fill functions don't work sometimes. good luck finding your saved form when you want to finish and send it. and why can't i load data from a po to a vendor and an invoice to a customer? i could go on, but won't. but seriously, the form design features are just ridiculously cumbersome and make me want to toss my laptop out the window. carry on.
great but could be greater. easy to use book work became so much easier with quick books online the only thing that i don't like is that you should be able to do everything across all platforms: ipad,iphone,laptop
. can't even use app from tablet
. have not upgraded since 2006, this app is great. i am not tied to the office for alot of tasks that used to only be done in the evening.
"bad idea. i downloaded to approve parole only to find i need a second app for that. two out of three ""recognized"" transactions are inaccurate. back to my mac for qb. ugly app guys. sorry..."
good app. goop app
fix it!!!!!!!!. when it works i like it, but when it flips out it is so frustrating. every time they update it it takes another couple updates to fix it. leave well enough alone!
great potential but.... the app has a great potential to replace the web version. however i do not understand why most of the features aren't in the app. i can't attach a pdf file to an invoice!! why? .. or i cant send an statement with the app.. why not ? .. why cant add company seal and stamp on the invoices ? ipad is a very capable device.. the app should bring all the features of the online version.
worthless. some functions don't work at all like banking. doesn't load account activity. it's so useless i have to use mobile web version.
slow to respond from time to time .. the app is sometimes slow to respond.
email is my only complaint i don't like my emails coming from into it i want to choose my own email so my customers can respond please fix this. respond it's when i'm sending invoices or estimates
multitasking?. would be nice if app supported multitasking.
. no matter what it wouldnt let me sign in, making me reset my password only to get a different log in error. after uninstalling reinstalling i'm still left with the same issues
don't update!!!!. if you are using the current version of quickbooks online for your ipad 2, don't update. it will lock you out. then you will have hours of dealing with the horrible customer no service that intuit provide for this mess of a product.
owner. love being able to have quickbooks on my phone and being able to send invoices and receive payments on the go. makes my job so much easier. app works great and is so simple that even my husband can figure it out :)
. i was finally able to utilize this valuable resource. it has simplified writing estimates. the more time you invest in filling in your information, the easier and useful this resource becomes. thanks and god bless
excellent. great mobile app from intuit, quickbooks online is great and although a bit different from the desktop version it has improved the way i work with my clients
. this is garbage
bad user interface. the service doesn’t fully integrate with mobil usage. paying for the payroll service and can’t even use it. garbage, waste of money.
saves time = saving money. great way to save time in keeping track of your business expenses and income. worth every penny for me saves me about 48 hours a week in managing my books and business.
works great!. it's simple to use, great for small business owners. really helps you stay on top of your business.
there’s just 1 thing... i have been loving the way this program functions. the only thing i continually wish for is that i would be notified when a customer opens an estimate, not just the invoice.
. excellent way to utilize your phone to help keep track of your expenses!
not accurate, crashes often. this app goes from being usable to worthless on a whim. it also does not show simple things like how many $ in open invoices, (right now it says we have $488 in total receivables, when we have way more). the desktop app is fine, the ios app needs a ton of work.
convenient. moving to quickbooks online plus has been a great move. there was a small learning curve but it is very stable and now we're very happy that we made the change. the best part is using the app on my iphone
. good app
do not switch. if you use tradition quickbooks, do not switch. you will be very disappointed with the lack of simple features that are standard on traditional versions.
used for many years but. intuit is increasing the price of quickbooks by 25% the next billing period. the app doesn’t support key functions that you can access online, for example adding multiple email addresses to one invoice.
. great app
. one of my top goto apps. very useful and a ton of functionality.
great. amazing app but whoever did that last update screw it all up. can save estimate or invoices. horrible. i hope they refund at least a month of fees because i'm loosing money having to do all my estimatesinvoices at my house instead. needs to be fixed asap.
"problematic app. upon originally downloading this app i was pleased. for the first 24hrs. i was impressed. then, i ""sent"" an invoice which the customer never received. next, it failed to update or sync with my account. when i attempted to update manually it chronically reported an error sighting that i should check my internet connection. frustrated, i uninstalled and reinstalled the app. now, it doesn't stay open for long before saying it stopped unexpectedly. i've reported every error without receiving any feedback."
. beware anyone cis don't use this use xero being mainly a cis contractor it won't let me make invoices in app so have to use browser which doesn't work so have to wait till i get home to invoice from laptop. i'm stuck till end of tax year then i'm off
. great app making it easier to track all of my business finances. and the fact that i can connect it to my other business apps saves me so much time.
. app never up to date with website or it does not show you everything you can see online. sometimes you can't even see anyone's invoices or estimates. always an issue.
user friendly. very easy to use
business owner must have. great app to work on the go. create, modify and email invoices. keep track of anything financial on your handheld device. fully automated office on the go for the busy self employed entrepreneur.
no packing list option. packing list and ability to share invoive via text, fax, or any messenger app
. cannot cancel subscription been trying for over 2 hours i will have to go to bank and change all of my account numbers because of this plus redo all of my direct deposits and all of my auto pay bills ..do not fall for this app
great timesaver. i used the free app and i have made up my mind that i will be purchasing this for my small construction business.
. so far i am verry happy with qb online. will update if this changes.
. app freezes and crashes several times a day. the photo receipt scan feature is probably the biggest culprit. even simple things like updating my business contact information yields an error message which is usually followed by a crash. the mac version of qbo isn't any better. similar issues there. very clunky, buggy applications. too much time spent troubleshooting. time for an alternative.
longtime quickbooks user. always pleased with the updates. best program i've used. very user friendly
the convenience of this service is worth every penny. without this app, i would often forget to log in after a job and record my time on an invoice. now, i can record billable time, field notes and expenses as i perform them, and email the bill to my customer upon my departure. the only thing i would like to see added is a way to record mileage as miles.
. this software has made it possible for me to run a business having no prior experience, and not really being good at budgeting personally. recommend it at the drop of a hat.
. app is very convenient to use but remains shy of all the features that exist on the online web platform. keep up the good work.
down graded. from april this app is unusable. i down graded to qb online. it appears it was released about a year too soon. nothing but frustration from day one. the ipad and iphone is useless.
chrashing in estimates. the app is great, only hiccup is that it restarts as soon as i go into opening a new estimate
emailing invoices. this is an excellent app for tracking income and expenses. however, whenever i try to email invoices, it gives an error message that it is 'unable to send message'. will give five stars if this issue is worked out.
"was great until recently. this used to be a great app until a few weeks ago. now, every morning when we go to open the app it states ""downloading company data"" and does this for hours. we have customers needing to get estimates, pay invoices, etc., but can't because we can't use the app! this just recently started happening. qb can you please fix this issue??? this type of problem shouldn't go on for this long!"
nearly there. having finally had enough of struggling with sage i started with qb. loving the online program which is so much easier and more intuitive than sage. the ipad app is a nice touch to quickly check things but if you need to do more than 1 or 2 simple things then better off going online instead.
incredible. this is an incredible application. if you're looking to intuitively streamline your business this is definitely the app for you!
very easy to use!. great tool and app!
love qb online. i love everything about it. my favorite features are the qb app and being able to process bids and invoices from my phone! and being able to accept online payments thru the invoicing feature is awesome too.
make that 6 stars. love love love this app! makes life easier!
. this app doesn't allow me to sign in, so it's been useless.
unfair and idiotic. your supervisor told me i would receive 3 months free quickbooks online...then i get a bill...then you refund my account and cancel it???!!! wow! and then waste hours of my time telling me you can't give me 3 months free? this is starting to look like a scam! not to mention the 1 star rating you receive from consumer affairs. you guys need to wake up and be professional!!
logs me off all the time. app is constantly requires entering password even with touchid enabled. not sure what the point of touchid is if a password is required
doesn’t work like the app on a pc. the fact that the apps are not the same on a pc than on the ipad or mobile is frustrating. can’t see running totals on the register, can’t add transactions the same way, etc. and the kicker is the website version doesn’t work at all on the ipad, can’t scroll through the register because scroll bars are absent in chrome or safari. horrible adaptation and makes the ipad useless to conduct accounting business with quickbooks...
crashing at start up with ios 13. love this app but it crashes with ios 13 :( please fix
. this app is so easy to use! it has helped a ton with our new family business!
. as someone starting a small business, i needed a quick and effective way to keep track of receipts, other costs, mileage, as well as sales and track a percentage of my profits that goes to a charity. i love having this easy to use app on my phone so i can input info on the go! highly recommend for the small independent business owner.
. dissatisfied. was able to get on to thw app because it kept saying there was an error. i was to finish the processes of registering online but just want to try out beforw purchasing it. it would allow me too. uninstall.....
. quickbooks support is worse than horrible... customer service is not reachable and they do not give proper timely responses for queries raised online... this is a product that has zero support options!!!
. card reader does not work for htc. card reader does not work
. i love this app.
many bugs. need to fix bugs that cause the app to not follow the regular online access. employees can see things they shouldn't (like business income) and are unable to do things they should like entering customer info and invoices.
excellent. j ai fait l essai d un mois et je suis conquis ! très bonne application très complète et simple à customiser  la fonction liée au comptes est aussi très pratique m évite de recopier toutes mes dépenses à la main
quickbooks online. great app!
error. a lot of error messages when trying to save things. only to find out it was saved twice afterwards.
. so far i haven't enjoyed this app. you can't scan a receipt with details auto uploading but you can on the selfemployed version and also had no luck at uploading a file into an expense when manually loading details from a receipt.
great app...! (sabre rx). great app, really works well now that the new syc app with square has been released.
good app.
superb!!!. this is a great app for keeping up to date with accounts. links to my bank accounts and intelligently matches transactions and remembers previous matches and entries. certainly deserves the name quickbooks based on how quickly i can enter my bank transactions. great for multiuser access and very easy to set up. overall this is much better than i expected.
great mobile app. allows me to take my business anywhere.
shady. very easily hacked and an unsafe server. average waiting time for customer service on the phone is hour. you will be transferred at least 2 to 3 times, hopefully you can get somebody who speaks english.
. good app
very good for any kind of business!. quickbooks is great app for managing the everyday finances. it's very fast to send invoices, with this app all income and expenses are simple and quick.
awesome!. great app, easy to use.
. i'm completely new to this app. because of that i might not know what to look for. but this makes starting up a business extremely easy. definitely plan on subscribing once the trial is up. 👍and would gladly suggest this app to anyone looking for this kind of help and ease.
new receipt feature not properly tested!. this new receipt photo feature is terrible. it captures about half the receipt every time! fix it, and test your changes before releasing them. a massive step back.
not for administrators. this app may be alright for sales people but doesn't do bookkeepers and admin people any good. i need to check register balances, p & l and balance sheets. this app doesn't allow for that.
. i use quickbooks online with a scheduling program that is synced together. i am a one man company but you could never tell. thanks to quickbooks. l also have increased profits
absolutely the best. very easy to use. tried different apps but none of them gave me results. i absolutely recommend it!
why get rid of banking section?. latest version update got rid of the banking section. now, i can't acceptexclude transactions, making the application almost totally and completely useless! too bad you can't give zero stars...
. sucks keeps saying i have update available but then everytime i try to download the upgrade i get error code 927 saying unable to complete download. with current app it doesn't allow me to look up past invoices. the things i use most are not on mobile app. all i do with it is print current invoices with my wireless eprinter and find customer contact numbers to call them. needs upgrading with more features.
. this is not mobile supportive app in india
pedro valdes,ea. very good for accountant, and clients. less time for both.
useful but slow. quickbooks online in general is useful for sending out invoices and estimates on the go, going through expenses, etc... however the platform can be fairly slow and sometimes glitchy.
. brilliant software
its ok. the app is ok my only issue is the invoicing it doesnt let you customize your invoice layout
poor software and worse support. software has limited features and the support agent gave me 3 different answers to 1 question. what hope does anyone else have with support like that. avoid this product
. simple. easy to use. reliable. 5 stars all around.
can't do my expenses on the app. i've started using quickbooks a few months ago. all was going ok but now i can't do my expenses on my app anymore. can't take pictures of my receipts to add them to my expenses. i contacted them and they said they are dealing with it but still no luck after a few weeks waiting. very frustrating. all other functions are working fine though. depe
thumbs up. wish it was cheaper, but i have to admit i love it and it makes my business easier to run.
make that 6 stars. love love love this app! makes life easier!
. can't access my quick books account from my phone. worked fine for a month now when i need it it doesnt work.
errors galore and inability to log into client accounts. i’m so disappointed with this app. as an accountant it would be handy to log into client accounts and check figures or enter small changes, but more often than not, i receive an error message and cannot log in. the issue renders this app completely useless.
. great app really helps with all my business needs one thing short of five stars and that's an in app calculator!!!!
. generally a good piece of software... but, if you happen to get an unusual glitch don't expect much help. two of our invoices have been resent to a client 3040 times per day for the last four months. my customer is upset and my bookkeeper has wasted days of time on hold or explaining the exact same situation to countless tech support. come on @intuitbrad is this the best your team can do?
. it has been 6 days and i still have not had my money deposited to my bank. oh and it is the day before thanksgiving. this is complete bs. negative stars. i need my money now. you guys should be embarrassed... 6 days and still not deposited. your customer service center lied to me and said it would be there...
. you're using it under a free trail and once it's up you nolonger have access to the app
great app!. very useful and convenient app.
"error. i dont even understand why massage always popup said ""failed to connect with server"" when everytime tried to login using this app..send several of email to support team but theres no answer n solution..please do something i am a quickbooks online plus subscriber.."
. i am finally happy 99% with qb online quickbooks has finally added the ability to add expences through the android market. it is now, by far the easiest way to send out estimates, invoices and add expenses. i'm a contractor and it works perfect for what i do. well worth the $40.00 a month, trust me. ............
almost perfect. just missing two things, edit or view notes online, and no touch id needed any time i try to open the app
. easy to navigate
another weak quickbooks mobile app. once again, with excitement i upgrade only to be letdown. when will intuit make a full function app? i love the message that tells me the function isn't't available for my device but i can access it from my pc...great, i'm still tied to my desk! why bother with the mobile app then?? i love how i can only rate this useless app once in the lifetime of having it,i would give it no stars if i could!
. i would give at least two more stars if the app actually lets me use my card reader, followed by the lack of automatic syncing and not even using active price rules whenever i need to make an invoice for a particular customer. please fix the card reader settings at least.
no bill?. come on, we can do all things with expense and nothing with bills? bills are the big part of our business expenses from our vendors. they are not even added to the total expense on the summary dashboard, how can we really tell how our business is doing when a big chunk of cost not appearing? please include the ability to enterviewedit bills asap.
quickbooks. the best accounting system and app there is no realistic comparison. easy to use.
great!. supeper user friendly aloha
fantastic app for small business. i have been using quickbooks for a year now. before i used to use myob and it used to cost me double what i pay now. it has all the features i need and usually works without any problems. i can write up quotes onsite, and send invoices before i leave the job. i highly recommend this app for small businesses.
. keeps asking me to install new version, have un installed and re installed but keeps sending me back to here to install so cant open my app! not what's needed when running a business.
newest update. loved the app until the newest update. now for some reason i can no longer receive payments from my phone. which is very frustrating. i have closed out the app, restarted my phone and still can't do it.
. its easy but the app needs work to be seemless. its not as userfriendly as the desktop version but for what i use it for its alright.
love using quickbooks!!. i love using it and it makes my business so easy and don't even need to carry my computer. i can actually do all of my invoices estimates anytime anywhere with my cell phone!
. doesnt download data keeps stuck at the download screen. was told to send an email to john_quickbooks@gmail.com and have not heard back from that address. how do they not have an @quickbooksonline.com support email for this stuff?
excellent app. make life way easy for small business
worst customer service. i love the idea of the app but it’s too confusing i don’t get a lot of the options and customer service i barely understood anything was no help at all. i just simply needed the app to track incomeexpense and personal pay.
. great app, easy to use!
easy to use, no enough control. the app looks great and is easy to use. it does not however, give me basic options. one example is that i can't seem to add the cost of materials and labor for an item that i sell. only the price of the sale. i have to manually add in expenses for each item. it's tedious and doesn't give me a good reading of how my business is doing.
. app is not working after the recent update, i am not able to login. it's simply goes blank after tapping the qb icon
finger print capable. you can now log into the app using your finger print
great app!!. accounting made easy, great interface and easy to use. highly recommended.
. i downloaded this app and not once has it worked. it crashes when i'm trying to login. i've never made it past the login screen!
the best app ever!!!!. there's no word i can use to describe this app. this is the best app i've ever seen. the functionality and the ease of use on iphone is amazing. 95% of my daily transactions are done on my phone. i love this app. good job intuit. no app does it better.
bugs!. so many bugs with this! i just rated it before and it’s popped up again asking me to rate. and i could go into so much more, however i’m only using this until next year. it’s shocking. i have just sent 3 invoices, the clients have received them, but they are not showing up in the app.
. if we can check stock from the apps, that would be better. please consider so i can use it just with my mobile to check everything.
not working properly after update #2. people have businesses to run!! i understand glitches from freecheap apps. not something that costs $360year. my books don't match from my phone to my computer. the pin still doesn't work, every time i edited an invoice it magically created a copy of an invoice that showed up 2 days later. now i have a ton of clean up to do in my books. it's time for me to find new accounting software.
love this app. the app links straight to your computer so you can send quotes, invoices etc on the move. this is a great small business tool at a great price.
. sucks. terrible app
categorize expense. useful. would be better if it can scan the photo and also categorize expenses.
ouickbooks. setting up this quickbooks app is a joke , the system does not work and customer support has an attitude that is not willing to help!
network problems. sometimes it says it has network problems and you have to cancel every data you just put in to try saving again. it can be two or three times that happens and that is really frustrating.
. highly recommend this app for every company
love it. works hand in hand with my computer program
has potential but still glitches. good functionality but i keep getting an error that an item is no longer valid and that i must refresh my data in settings. but there is no refresh option in settings.
app crashes constantly. i used to love this app. the last couple of months the app crashes daily and multiple times. i’m in the middle of working and the app says critical updates are needed and logs me out. i’m extremely frustrated with this considering i pay over $20month to use this software across all my devices. no resolution or contact from customer service. it happens almost weekly. what a nightmare. looking for alternatives.
over promised, under delivered. the desktop app is slow and the mobile app is lacking pretty important features. their tech support is horrible and can take days to resolve an issue....if they even admit that there is an issue.
. a great app. for basic functions, app is good. for full functionality, use a desk top computer for acess for online quickbooks is better to use.
. since they changed the app its not working properly nothing appears on the dashboard and can't produce invoices
. love the qbo app for small businesses. so much that can be done quickly.
vital for biz. makes it simple to analyze business from your phone.
great system. quickbooks online has made my life loads easier and less stressful many thanks
. not functioning as many have stated to be having the same issue unable to view customers invoices ect on the home screen obviously a common major issue need a fixing
. incredibly hard to unsubscribe, i have been paying for this app and do not need it after 2 years. i still cannot find the unsubscribe part on google play and have followed the useless instructions to do so. not happy.
. terrible app, customer service is a joke with no follow up. switching to a different accounting software.
. great can make invoices on site
does not work well at all very frustrating. frustrating
so convenient. i use this app for work all the time. it is so handy to have it on my phone when i leave the office.
love tracking expenses.. being able to expenses right at the gas pump just makes sense. taking photos of receipts just makes things easier i wish i would've left the desktop app a while ago.
over all good app. it would get 5* if the invoices showed more details about the bill. like individual dating for services done. that way the customer better understands the invoices.
ridiculous omission. i can not believe that with all of the updates that you still can not create a purchase order with this app. ridiculous.
starting with errors. i am just starting my beekeeping business and trying to track expenses. quick books somehow has me making a $164 sale. i can't erase it because it doesn't exist. would love it but can't reconcile the books if random numbers are calculated out of thin air!
new update 115. the new update is horrible!! i used to be able to search customers by address and the search bar is gone. also, whatever screen i choose to be in, i have to fully close the app out to go back! what happened?!?!
owner. great app
. great app!
slow to update. pretty useless app.
makes life easy. great app that makes accounting on the fly so simple.
owner. app is a great convenience
app crashes constantly. i used to love this app. the last couple of months the app crashes daily and multiple times. i’m in the middle of working and the app says critical updates are needed and logs me out. i’m extremely frustrated with this considering i pay over $20month to use this software across all my devices. no resolution or contact from customer service. it happens almost weekly. what a nightmare. looking for alternatives.
. awesome app, extremely useful to track finances.
. sales receipt and invoice not round off available in mobile apps create invoice not show retail invoice and tax invoice in mobile i am a paid version user and i am pc login all options are work properly but mobile apps issue i have made complete 4 tims in call center but agent ask me team work this issue
. best app ever
great app. great app quick and easy to make estimates and invoices. would like for there to be more customization such as adding business information to show on them rather than just email address however overall is a great app very happy with it.
mobile glitches... love using quickbooks but i run my business out of town where we are not able to have wifi other than mobile hotspot. using the quickbooks mobile has been convenient but also a p.i.t.a... glitches, closes on its own, logs me out, and sometimes doesn’t save invoicesestimates. has been like this for a while and haven’t had any changes..
unreliable. this app is buggy and slow. logging in is very hit or miss. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't for no apparent reason. i have not been able to log in for a week. all i get is an error message telling me to try again later. called support and i was told that they are working on it. this app has been out for years, and there is no excuse for it being so unpredictable.
banking synchronisation. the level of failure is becoming unacceptable. every update from quickbooks results in failure. then there are the occasions when the bank upgrade and qb does not. we rely on you to make it work seamlessly and always.
crashing. after 3 new updates in the last month app keeps crashing and losing everything i am doing.
purchase order. i like the app it's a good app there is one screw up and a big one i wonder if it's only me who uses it why can't i make a purchase order on the app ??? other wise it's a great app
app crashes. ever since update cannot open app. need to fix immediately.
. scammers!!!! worst mistake you can make! this company is a bunch of scammers. i used this service for about a week and found that i can't stand it, so i canceled over a year ago. my credit card still gets charged 40 bucks every month. i've got my credit card company involved and everything. this company sucks!!!
unusable on ipad pro. was intending to transfer all of my business computing over to my more than capable ipad pro. intuit seems to have other ideas. unable to run my business with the quickbooks software with the app or through the browser. a very unsatisfactory situation having my computing need dictated by intuit. will change software as soon as practical.
. so far easy to navigate and set up still learning the system cool so far
managing partner at green mesa capital, llc. a very useful app. i can do everything i want through this app. in addition, the app has features the browser does not have, like the expense receipt capture.
sign in issue. great app, except the need to confirm with text or email every time upon sign in!! would have rated higher with out this issue. very frustrating
okay. i'm new to doing my own bookkeeping and find this product clunky and not very easy to use. issues with importing transactions and program changing dates and the order compared to the bank. it's not very easy to see what account transfers are moving tofrom. it's hard to distinguish credits for debits. poor customer service. no good summary graphs. slow to attach receipts. multiple clicks to do basic things. cuts off file names if there too long.
app crashes. this app crashes or cannot save my data on every entry i make. horrible app!!
. origionally i wanted to use this app for easy application of spreadsheets and invoices, unfortunately when everything wasn't working out for me, i decided to pull the plug and cancel my subscription. unfortunately, it is hard to get a cancellation and stop the reoccurring payments and it has brought me here. i would recommend that you guys make it easier for others to manage your subscription accounts.
. great app, doesn't crash and still much to learn from it bur its helping keep my business organized
sucks. stupid
terrible app. you are unable to view and use the register, reconcile accounts and other simple everyday banking tasks. logging into your company through a mobile browser, such as the google chrome app for ipad, does give you access to some but not all tasks. isn't the purpose of online banking to be able to perform all banking from mobile devices?
. best app ever i used
amazing. i haven't seen smart accounting software like this 👍🏼
. it's a great app but i wish it could do bank recs and have a little more of the web functionality. at least i'm able to do basic billing.
i'd complain about crashing. but it won't even open. i used this app every single day for years, now its trash?! get it working please. i have paperwork that needs to get done.
. horrendous support from the philippines. works well when all the feeds are set up. just horrendous getting to that point
it's a good app. very convenient. the mobile app isn't perfect, and as some have pointed out a few features are missing in the mobile app. but qb is convenient. i can take payments, check accounts, and do basic things while i'm out and about. it's good, and quickbooks online support has been great lately.
timed out....... worked for 2 hours on typing big estimate, session timed out, lost everything, how is this able to happen? we send people to the moon in 1969 yet we can’t safeguardprevent this app from wasting hard work and precious time. it’s the first time i thought i could throw my ipad into the next county. fix this stupidity
. best accounting app i have used. the functions in the app has enabled me to easily access clients information to provide information for decision making. best
. unable to see customer payment transactions and limited functionality. unable to generate detailed customer statements.
very happy. this app makes my accounting work super easy, can't wait for all features to be available on the app.
nexus 6p problems. still does not work on nexus 6. i'm trying to run a business this app use to make me efficient. now it sucks that i can no longer log in to upload receipts. i would give it zero if i could.
. works fine on my android phone (granted, i don't use it very often!) but it's 100% buggy in chromebook. i opened it, managed to add one banking item, then it froze. i opened it again, and it froze before i could even load current invoices. uninstalled. i'll keep using the web version
. helpful and useful
. really help full
need improvement. it needs improvements so dont download untill it has updated
great app. keeps my business organized
horrible and near useless. often doesn't sync properly with online version, customers and invoices disappear, crashes often. basically... find another solution because this one will only drive you insane.
useless. my boss uses qb to track my hours. as far as i can tell, i can't make those changes on this app. that makes this app totally useless to me.
. good easy compliment app to the cloud. could use some improvements for speed and updating however very easy to use
. i don't usually write reviews, i always dread using the app. i have a lot of receipt that i need to add to expenses. it's a big effort to find the right transaction and add the receipt. it's painful to juggle between banking transaction and expenses. if usability of the app doesn't improve it's enough for me to pay extra and move to xero.
needs work. i love the functionality of it but i wish it would integrate paypal for the option on invoicing. my customers all use paypal & im double sending because there is not a paypal button on this invoice program!
. easy to navigate, makes bookkeeping fun..almost.
"brilliant!!!!. works like a dream with qb online. i can finish a job and then send the invoice from my phone (whilst sitting at home drinking a cuppa!). just include ""totals"" for estimates and sales invoices please!"
on track. keeping track of daily expenditure, and the performance of my business is so much easier with this app.
useless. takes too long to add a simple expense.
not happy any longer!. having issues logging in every single time now, very frustrating and not happy at all. always asking for finger print, and when typing in my password, it takes about 5 attempts before it’ll login to my company info. also having a constant lag when trying to inputsubmit any items to customers. this is extremely upsetting when trying to submit invoices before a deadline.
so much better. intuit have certainly listened to there customers and have massively improved the app with some recent updates. so much better and easier to use than before. well done intuit finally glad a huge company has finally listened to its customers
. very convenient it's a convenient and easy to use app. the only downfall is not being able to insert new fields. so a ;  )
time saver, makes everything simple. thus app saves time and allows for doing simple tasks on the go making my church more accurate and efficient
"app doesn't work. after speaking with the help desk the advise i got was ""the app must not compatible with your phone (iphone 6 plus)"". i leave this review as i only signed up with quickbooks to manage my businesses accounts ""on the go"" and it's been a waste of money for this purpose"
nice, but naughty. i am writing this review at christmas, that explains the headline :) this app used to be awesome. now i get a lot of can not connect to data or can not refresh data even after multiple refreshes. hope they fix it
master electrician. this app has done everything that i have asked of it. fantastic of estimating, invoicing and receiving payments in the field while on the job site. really saves me time.
user friendly but. this program is extremely user friendly and makes book keeping easy for small business owners but the cost of doing payroll for employees is extremely expensive. i have 5 employees and it costs way to much for me to use quickbooks 👎
. i am totally dissatisfied with qb small business app and quickbooks in general. i'm also using an android and having the same syncing problem. i will be cancelling my subscription with quickbooks altogether and will be going with one of their competitors. it has been a waste of my time with all the phone calls with their technical support in the philippines who gave totally incorrect information about the issue which was clarified when i spoke to customer service in sydney.
perfect. this is a great app and works perfect for my business
. really frustrated, do not buy this app through google, once you setup you account through good you can not upgrade you account or transfer it to a regular subscription. so i'm just stuck with what i have....
dcs lassalle inc. op manager. trucking and rigging company local and long distance
great app but missing some key functions. i've used qb online for a year now and its a great service. the app allows me to invoice and record pymts immediately, however i cant seem to enter expenses. if i could do that it would get 5 stars.
terrible experience with customer support. we had terrible experience with customer support. for a very important issue we contact qb customer support team, we wait for 6 days an never respond our request. for this incident we can't bill our invoices. we hate our experience. consider customer support if your company needs help.
poor. need to put password in every time i start can't write a service invoice and an amount
solid for business. great app for a small nonprofit. easy to navigate and i appreciate the prompts!
good app. no complains
great app, easy to use!. this is a great financial management app. i'm far from an accountant but once you have your chart of accounts set up, keeping track of expenses and income is a breeze! a few swipes of your finger and you can reconcile your bank accounts. if only more things were this easy!
great for mobile small business !. we couldn't live without our quickbooks online mobile app! look up information and match bank transactions right away. would like to see more functionality for customer and vendor invoicing and billing options as well as filtering but overall a great, easy to use tool.
app crashes on ios13.0 & 13.1. i’ve just updated the app and it’s still crashing on ios13.0 and also 13.1. i have tried to make contact with the developers via the support page but it also loads to blank pages after opening chat.
quick books app. good to connect and keep up with the business!
great app. i use that app quite frequently. easy to use and gives me all the information i need to access.
. using a samsung note edge: cannot update estimates at all. been using this app for months and it constantly locks up and crashes.
horrible photo receipt capture function. the recent update apparently changed the algorithm for identifying receipt paper boundary in a photo that makes no sense at all. two out of three times it only capture a useless fragment of the whole receipt which the makes entering receipts a horrible and utterly frustrating experience.
not bad needs a little work. online is getting better with each update. i love the update with the option to deposit money in different accounts
honestly i would rate this app 0!. app doesn't work at all, getting error every time i'm trying to login. no respond from team during a week! just stay away of it!!! if you think that your advice to reinstall would help  you are wrong! i did it already couple if times before your advise finally came in. this app just doesn't work and i wouldn't spent more time for it!!!!!! stay away of it!!!
. love that i can create estimates, invoices, and view my banking account activity all on the go with one app.
in sync. i would give it a 5 if the ipad and android versions were synced faster and had the same features.
love it!. took me a while to get confident using it as i was used to doing things manually but now i love it. and especially love the app. don't know how i managed before!
great. nice app! works well for what i need!
great. easy estimate, signing, invoicing process.
. app opens, prompts to upgrade, no upgrades available. repeat. please make sure the upgrade is 100% released to the play store *before* forcing users to upgrade.
. both the desktop and the mobile app are unstable. if i decide to stay with quickbooks and that's a big 'if' i will return to the regular desktop version. the gui sucks and is not intuitive in any way and the help section is inadequate .
. i love the freedom that qbook gives me with the online version i can work at any place out side of the office.. also update are free and there free support team are the best. thanks so much qbook for be there for my business and me..
$12.95 a month = free ???. misleading. first month free, then 12.95 a month. my bank is free for these types of services. i'm not happy that i wasted my internet gigabytes on a download that i can't afford. unprofessional. if i could afford i wouldn't pay just because you don't explain that clearly before someone downloads. poor business
rip off. installed as companion to desktop. feature guide limited to decide which online version to choose. chose simple version since my needs are simple... no, wrong version, could i upgrade, no... support desk said i’d then lose the introductory half price... changed version... losing £6... chose next tier up for billing, £9 per month... no, wrong version again... so i’ve lost £15 and now need to upgrade to the plus version... beware folks, money grabbing machine.
. it works only ok. if there was a better 3rd party app, i'd use it. most of the time i'm frustrated using this app. either buttons don't work, attachments don't save, or some other random instability. i want to do more with the app and i want it to work every time. the design is questionable too. why are things labled differently than in the full version?
. app opens, prompts to upgrade, no upgrades available. repeat. please make sure the upgrade is 100% released to the play store *before* forcing users to upgrade.
. very good and intuitive, i had trouble recording all my sales, but it's super practical with the app
tax ratescounties are incorrect. when i create an invoice from this app, it doesn’t select the correct county even when i manually change it. it causes it to transfer back to desktop version as the wrong county when saved and will not account for that county. please fix
. easy to use & productive... few features of the webpage version are not available on the app such as print or downloading packing slip, can't prepare a purchase order, etc. but overall, the app is helpful. thanks.
so far so good.. i spent about nine or 10 hours trying to get my quickbooks program converted over to my mobile phone from my desktop after speaking with someone that barely spoke any english for six or seven hours i was told to call back the following day because they could not figure out what i needed to get done when i called back the next day thank god someone that spoke english answered and i had my problem resolved in about 20 minutes.
very handy app. so far like this app. i need not go to my computer for bookkeeping or to see what’s going on with accounting. only i am not happy about general entries. earlier, i was able to open and see general entries. now app doesn’t open general entry. when i tried to open, it took me back to homescreen.
no support for timesheets. also no custom reports
. the perfect accounting software for people on the go.
bank loggin. can not log on and get my bank updates anymore  gives me a error messages all the time  no help from customer service, they refer me to a engineer  has been down now 4days  no help.....ready to cancel my subscription
needs more estimate print fields options. need to be able to print estimates & invoices showing 'only' discounted net prices for the line items. my customers hate that they have to do the math for each line. otherwise, this is awesome. thank you intuit for everything you do!
beware the wifi!. after a recent update the invoicing does not work over wifi. forced to do invoices over my iphone on the network. fix it!!!!
. it takes a little while to get used to it i've always had the desktop version when i had questions the support staff was 100% awesome answered questions research the answers and was able to get back to me with the solution. i've use quickbooks for 25 years and will remain using their product awesome updated version able to use your phone to keep track of receipts
. this app is great for tracking income and expenses! feels good to know how i am doing on a dailyweeklymonthlyqtrlyannual basis. keeps me competitive and on track financially.
. good app
best accounting app except for some glitch. it is the best accounting app that i had so far. i like the inventory part. what i don't like is that the activities for the suppliers are empty but with the web and desktop app the activities appear.
poor design. very hard to navigate and understand. customer service only works bankers hours and not when you need them.
. great app and very simple to use.
easy to use, instrumental to my business. keep it glitch free please
stopped working after the update. this was working great until the software update last week. now i end up creating multiple copies of invoices and estimates and the app just freezes on the saving screen. i can only finish off by logging in through a web browser and completing the task. please fix this fast intuit!
very powerful tool. the app is really nice and efficient. will get even better when the ability to create a credit note is made available on both ios and android devices. i really don't understand why this must have feature has not been added yet. thanks!
perfect software for the right companies. i absolutely love it! i have a small freelance design company, so i'm billing for services and commissions. there is nothing i need that it doesn't do and do well. i don't need inventory, estimates or payroll, so this program is about as friendly to me as it could possibly be.
fast on the go. very useful once u get used to it!
. i love the app! there are a few updates i'd like to see on the estimates and order entry fields but it's still saves so much time. it really has changed the way i do business. great app and program.
good apps. it's okay
stopped working. worked great until about 1 week ago. now i can’t see income and expense charts. also can’t view and accept transactions. i’m using an iphone 7.
. would like to be able to send invoices
great app. has helped my business be very successful.
. crashes often
. great but i would like to be able to customise the quote and invoice templates and a bit disappointed that the mileage tracking is not part of this its a different app with it's own cost otherwise great
works well but. some features don't integrate with qbo and visa versa. i think this product should be as similar as possible across all available platforms.
better than sage. so i've been using sage for about a year now and decided to switch to quickbooks. best decision ever. quickbooks is much more simple. totally recommend it.
. need to integrate payroll and qb into one app. quickbooks payroll mobile app is not what expected. not sure why employees are not visible in qb's online mobile app.
waste of valuable time.. all i wanted was a simple app to send 1 (one) out of state customer an invoice at the end of the month. my other 2 (two) customers don't really need one. took an hour to set it up and a couple more to figure out i was declined. just wanted something simple.
cool app. i would have given it 5 stars, but it just doesn't have the power that i'm used to with the real quickbooks, but it's ease of use and functionality is still great for a new app.
great as an assistant to the desktop version.. i've found this app to be a great mobile partner to the full desktop (or online) version. there's a couple functions that aren't available in the app but everything you do need is easily available. i can't connect my bank account because my (non us) bank isn't listed but being able to input expenses as they happen is a great way of keeping updated accounts. reconciliation is a breeze afterwards. it's a great app.
. it sucks if you have credit problems you can't link bank and get payment they don't say that anywhere though do they
recent update. crashes frequently! if editing an estimate or invoice on ipad it opens in a floating window that can slide down into the abyss and all progress is lost! very unhappy with the latest update!
one of the best accounting software.. very good and well made accounting software. very easy and friendly to use. the things i especially like about this application is that i can book an expense on the go through the mobile app and i can access this accounting software from anywhere and on any device!!
. i've just started using qb and i'm very impressed. i was using xero and truelly,it has been horrendous. qb all the way. so user friendly.
made my life easier. i use to spend all weekend doing paper work and now i do it as i go in the car.
. dont download this update if your using an lg phone... after update unable to sign in... i get thru the sign in screen then it crashes... pos
. one of the best accounting software's i have used for my business on the go.
great app!!. great app
system modify for the better. great system except when you send an invoice out there is no way to mark it that it has been sent out . so you constantly have to keep a note book with all the customers and what is going on with each individual invoice.
update is terrible. since the update, navigation of the app is clunky at best. you can no longer match transactions, or do anything with your banking accounts except to see the balances. no transactions will work. this update has way to many flaws. be cautious to download.
perfect for my accounting firm. love this app! it's perfect for my accounting firm to track our books and clients. i even like how it works with quickbooks online accountant. 5 stars for all.
love it. so easy to use and fantastic customer support for those of us who are not good at this kind of thing, would highly recommend quickbooks for all small businesses, we love that being online we can have it on all our devices and have what ever we need on hand all the time, no more leaving quotes at home! invoicing on the run is great too.
great tool for small business. i'm a self taught qb online user. was very intimidating at first, but what makes the difference is the amazing phone support staff. they are so patient and professional, i've never had to wait long for them to answer either. i highly recommend qb for anyone who wants to understand their business better and make better business decisions.
. great app makes things easier
. great app, really so much better than anything else, there are a few things i would like to improve my experience... hard to explain... but i'll try... when i assign expenses on my phone, i have to go on to a desktop to tick billable.... does that make sense?
. i have been a happy customer u till this new update every time i try to logon it keeps saying the internet seems to be offline... now i can not update my sales n payments
. as a selfemployed individual, you get no support. do not buy. wasted over two hours on the phone with various customer service reps and was informed that you get online support. lost three weeks of work in few mins. they won't even give me refund. wish i can give negative stars!!!
don’t you qa this stuff?. the expenses screen is still full of bugs. the whole thing goes wrong after adding a photo (which, incidentally, are now auto cropped even worse than before) and returning to the expenses screen. don’t you test this stuff before releasing it?? (i’m on iphone x).
"issues. it was working fine on my ipad up until last week. then starting bugging. not all customer transaction appear on the mobile app. called customer service about it. they told me that they were ""working on it"". we shall see. i pay for it monthly...i asked if i still had to pay this month even though it's not working as advertised...answer was yes. not happy with that answer. i will keep you posted. bob"
crashes non stop on ipad. crashes non stop on ipad
. this app has made life much easier and more organized
can't login. can't reset password
. zero stars if i could. app never tracks my milage and is constantly failing. waste of money.
useless app. mileage tracking is grossly inaccurate, way too many inadequacies and limitations on the invoicing and accounting features. this app is a joke. i tried it for several months and have lost money as a result of it's shortcomings. the positive reviews here must be fake. do your research and search the web for accurate reviews. i recommend everlance as a better option.
disappointed. just updated to the latest version and this app is crashing all day i can’t even use it normally i need to log on 10 times to write one customer i can’t run my business normally like this please fix asap the app tells me you need to do critical updates. idiot i juts updated the app and now it crashes ever time i open it
. good app
too many error messages. for what you pay for a quickbooks online account, this app for ipad and iphone is really disappointing. i get an error message almost every single time i try and enter a new transaction. sometimes it works despite the error message, sometimes it doesn't. but i get the error every time. i can't even access the banking functions as i get an error message and nothing will load. the only function that seems to work properly is the reports section.
. stupid 2apps at qb idot coders. so you have one app and it is great that tracks mileage and receipts but it doesn't communicate with cloud quickbooks. then you have this app that doesn't have those features. how can you dominate the market and be this foolish someone's going to come along and take their lunch money.
. best app yet
. great app very convenient and allows me to manage my accounts on the road. i have a business where i am always out driving and the app saves me a lot of time & it allows me to get things done while i'm out of the office.
good. quite intuitive, would be nice to have an offline mode  create new customer, new estimate or invoice that could synchronize when reconnected to internet. i work out of coverage on many remote camps. aside from that, solid!
very intuitive. incredible app. i find it easier to use than the desk top version.
business owner. this is a great product ! i don't know how i would keep my business organized without it. also customer services is awesome. this is a must have app!!!!
good app. not 100% good.
. great app!!
. can't print invoices should have a print invoices if on home network
i am truly loving this app. been hunting for a simple app for managing the finances of my farm business. this helps me with capturing and analysis of all my expenses and income. the reporting is also amazing. i also love the fact that i can even get more stats and reports via the web. amazing stuff. already introduced it to quite a number of industry colleagues. truly an amazing app
great tool for self employed small business owners. easy to use and easy to navigate
love this app!!. i love how easy to use this app is but my only problem is that i can't sync it with my company's ocbc account and my shopify's store's inventory.
payroll done quickly!. love this app!
. so far it is superb
. having a horrible time with quick books. everytime i try to start the free trial just to check efficiency of the app so that i can go purchase it. but as soon as i go to enter the company name the app hangs and closes off.
. easy to use and make life way easier to keep track of inventory and sales.
makes business happen!. this powerful app makes my business happen! very easy to make sales on the go and keep track of all my ins and outs. thank you!
reports needed. need simple reports such as sales tally for a given day.
. explain to me why i cannot screenshot anything any more? i have multiple customers that like to see their over all balance owed but now i can't send them a screenshot anymore. so you update the app to fix things, manage to mess up the one feature that worked best for me and still haven't fixed th spelling on the word supplies (it's literally spelt suppliea). great job!
impressed. i put off upgrading to online version after using quickbooks pro for five years, struggling to enter online direct debit expenses and payments. online version makes entering data easy and efficient. such a time saver for me. well done intuit! definitely worth the monthly subscription fee.
"can't add unit with quality and rate in invoice. online version does not allow customisation of fields. invoice doesn't show ""unit"" with quantity and rate as a result invoice are unusable in real world. hope developer address these issue at priority before we users move to other applications."
error add item. ne fonctionne pas, toujours un message d'erreur quand je veux entrer un item ou une description. impossible de faire une facture avec mon mobile !
great app. very helpful, only complaint is, i would like more features like the desktop version. i would like to be able to get into my online version and accept register transactions, look at taxes that are owed, stuff like that. but over all a huge time saver. and has gotten me out of some tight spots. thank you
"""sign in"" button doesn't work.. couldnt create an account because the button to send verification sms wouldn't work. no time for that. moved on."
good. quite intuitive, would be nice to have an offline mode  create new customer, new estimate or invoice that could synchronize when reconnected to internet. i work out of coverage on many remote camps. aside from that, solid!
awesome app! totally enables business on the go!. businesses on the go!
. i'm on the go a lot and being able to access qb online from my mobile lets me access and do things quickly and efficiently. i'm able to create invoices and see who owes me money. it's great
can't do much. you can't pay bills, enter bills, or do almost anything that i do on a daily basis on my computer. the app is nice looking but useless for anything i need to do besides check my balance.
excellent app. im using quickbooks plus online n also the app..its easy to use...but sometime delay to update in the app after do activity in desktop.. ☺
. not for indian. can register as i am from india
update ruined app. since the last update you cannot run credit cards on the app. it crashes immediately when you attempt to. my business uses qb on 25 devices. all crash when taking payments. this has caused a massive issue for us and clients. beware of putting too many eggs in the basket of a company that can be sloppy with the interface they sell you.
excellent on ipad, good on iphone. i use this app on my ipad and iphone, it's pretty good on the iphone but it's darned good on the ipad. hopefully they will develop more features on both over time as it's still not a total replacement for the web browser version.
easy to use, no enough control. the app looks great and is easy to use. it does not however, give me basic options. one example is that i can't seem to add the cost of materials and labor for an item that i sell. only the price of the sale. i have to manually add in expenses for each item. it's tedious and doesn't give me a good reading of how my business is doing.
works okay but app needs work. funny how if they spent a little more time and money on their point of sale app that they could get two to three times the amount of business. the app needs work. there needs to be more options for customizing the invoice and it really lacks customer management ability. if your just going paperless it’s not bad but like i said the app could really use some work.
. quickbooks does not work. it's a terrible program with a zero customer support. the problems i have are very basic and i'm certain others experience the same problems yet they are never resolved. i can't attach screenshots and i don't have the patience to enter all the problems experienced but i hate quickbooks and it's a shame that have such a grip on the industry because i would dump them with a smile immediately if i could
. am happy that it allows me to.make estimates from my mobile phone
. terrible service. automated systems will keep hitting your bank account causing all kinds of problems. be ware giving them access to your bank info
. does not work on my pixel phone. sucks i have to pay the same rate as everyone else but can't get all the benefits. update...the email address intuit gave me to email does not work...shocker.
. cant even login. keeps telling me to restart app amd try again
. this app works great
. works great very user friendly! just wish i could sync it with my square app
. awesome app
. fantastic overall experience. easy and convenient to use
. great app on my android. can it be used in my fire tablets?
. game changer! i've only had it downloaded for 5 minutes and i love it! i will change this review, if any hiccups change my mind, after further use.
new user. will be happy to see how useful this is for my company.
keeps getting better and better!. indispensable for small businesses. qb online and ipads are a big part of our ability to maintain triple digit growth year over year.
no inventory tracking, no reminder. very disappointed with this no inventory tracking, no reminder for the app no not also for me its pointless quickbooks you better fix it i am cancelling my subscription
small businesses best friend. if you have a small business this should be the first thing that you get. having this on your phone to do invoices on the spot is the only way to go.
"quick books is the bombdiggity!! ya heard!. as a small business owner it saves me time, click, picture of the receipt, click and the expense is logged in real live time. no more saving piles and piles of receipts. it also pin point tracks your expenditures. it's the ""bombdiggity""!"
wow! loving the switch!. it's more than i had ever expected. using square or other solutions or good old fashion checks in the mail are nothing compared to how seamless qbo has made my life. that mac app, ipad app, iphone app and even the apple watch app give me the pulse on our company that i've needed for so long. can't wait to grow into more solutions with qbo!
can't create po's through app. i use quickbooks for 2 things mainly. to create estimatesinvoices and send pos once the invoice has been paid. i can't create po's with the app so it's useless. i have to go to the website every time i want to create a po. it makes no sense that they would leave this feature out.
. the app is currently not working as i cannot login for the last few days. i can login to their website so it's just the app. i have sent the error log a few times and still no fix. i have deleted the app and redownloaded still no luck.
awesome app. i run a small business and i use quick books to manage my entire business! from estimates to invoices to getting paid its all so easy and fun to use! thanks guys
qb mobile. we use it at our retail location. love the integration the mobile app gives. its a nice feeling to know i'm always on the same sheet of music no matter where i'm at. excellent !
waste of time. crashes at least 50% of the time i try to enter an expense while on the go
useless. maybe im missing something, but wouldn't the point of accessing you accounting software to be to actually get useful info? you cant even see bank accounts or balances. why have a way to make payments without seeing whats in your accounts?
. unfriendly interface need to load inventory data on invoice costs profits etc no facility
online quick books rocks!. they do a great job with this application. amazing how you can create invoices on the road and take deposits from your phone!
. excellent app to get into your data on the road. i understand more functionality would be useful but being able to raise & query jobs and send out estimates & invoices 'in the wild' on my mobile phone is a real asset.
. i have had this app on my phone for years. i tried opening it and i was told to update the app. so i did. now it will not open. it just keeps telling me to update. i have uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it still does not work. my business is important and this makes me very mad
. garbage. doesn't even have a spot to track vehicle expenses. in the self employed version you can. but you can't track hst. would be nice to have one option for everything.
. its very good program keeping my books in order, reminding of unpaid invoices connects to external management software, great stuff
app. best account app
it's ok not super. i'd like to have the ability to creat checklists and forms that aren't effectively invoice like. i also don't like intuit screwing with their databases and allowing some invoices and expenses to go missing from my account.
quick books online is the best solution when your on the road. i have to be out of town and need the ability to interface with my main office and keep everything updated qbo does it simply!
. best app for bussiness by far!
fantastic app. easy to use.. i wish they give more invoice customization options..
. was working awesome until last update. now won't log in. just has that loading thing come up forever
scope for lots of improvement. given that this app has been out for many years, it seems like it has been neglected. the interface shows it. for example, if we touch a vendor, only the address shows up and nothing else. ideally, all details related to the vendor have to be displayed  po, bills and payments. many such improvements can be done.
. dreadful experience so far. bought qb 16th dec 2019 and cant get a call back from an english speaker to help me with set up despite multiple attempts! why is sales uk based but support isnt? this is 2nd review  1st disappeared!!! so disappointed and very desperate to get started. i can login to qb online but says im in usa not uk. i have emailed you twice now. still no reply.
working great. seem to be doing really well. some things are better done on desktop but for the most part can do a invoice from phone and accept payments.
incredible. totally simplified my accounting.. i switched from sage to qbo and have not looked back. easy to setup and learn. can send invoices from my phone in seconds. i recommend it to everyone i know!!
quickbooks lies again. this app does not track mileage as advertised
high hopes cause big fails. the app crashes all of the time. no integration with desktop versions but ok. i though i would have something on the go for small invoices. i can't get through the first invoice. all progress gets lost with the crashes. i love how much time i save with the desktop version. there customer service has always been terrible. they can't even have a fully working version for the trial period. fail!
. this is a very user friendly app. i can modify and create estimatesinvoices on the fly! good work intuit!
. not nearly as useful as the desktop version very weak app. still needs tons of improvement
works wonderfully. the functions now work wonderfully i just wish i could add project dates to the invoices and have them reflected in the google calendar.
good, but not comprehensive. it is useful for seeing a basic snapshot of your company, but lacks some of the more useful functions (such as, for us at least, paying employees, reconciling accounts, and viewing job profitability reports).
don’t update to ios 13 if you want this to work. there a so many bugs with this app now that ios version 13 has been released. you can’t even enter an expense now without an error popping up that you need to create a template. quickbooks online support has been no help. they advised i use the browser on my phone. what’s the point of the app then? test test test folks.
expenses. how can i add a credited amount in expenses? in the qb online mobile apps??
useless!. can't edit products without losing the changes. can't edit purchases. overall, still very buggy and slow. had to buy a windows 10 tablet to get it to work. mobile apps for ios and android sucks big time!
great. perfect app for my business accounts on d go
good app but.... i automatically give apps that force me to rate them a onestar.
. this app works amazing for my cleaning business! couldnt live without it, and it saves me a lot of money instead of paying an accountant
. this is an awesome app. make my life so much easier!! it easy to use for my home business.
bad app! bad app!. i loved the app... then it fell apart. i cannot get it to show current status on anything! why is it so hard to keep a good app 'good' ??
. this app makes my life so much easier
great app. does cost money this app. it’s definitely worth it! the app keeps up to date
very useful!. this app allows me to send clients a sales receipt as soon as they hand me the cash, invaluable when visiting clients.
. connect to banking and reconcile in minutes. email invoices...so no snail mail.
new app is great!. the new app is super user friendly and versatile. it’s easier to use quickbooks from my phone than it is from my pc now. vast improvement over the previous versions.
. very easily can invoice on the go
convenient. best app ever for business
. i use this app for 2 separate businesses. is very easy to use and track all of my finances.
. how do we upload multiple files on app? thanks.
when i am done, i am done!. as a contractor i love to do my estimates one time, hit convert to invoice one time, hit receive payment one time and i am done with my paperwork and money is heading my way before i leave the job site. when i get home i can just spend time with the family rather than swim through paperwork. great service!
for a guy who is running his own business this is gold!. love how easy it is to invoice and snap receipts on the go. tracks all my invoices so if those subcontractors don’t pay i’m onto them straight away! cheers for making it so easy!
love but.... great! except would love to be able to make a deposit with the app
bank transfers take too long. i am very frustrated. it has been 1 week since my clients paid their invoice and the money still is not in my bank account after 1 week. unacceptable!
. does not work its rubbish app
. great app
"amazing for my business. i wouldn't know where i would be running my own business without this app. it truly gives an ""on the go"" experience and aided with other tools i can work anywhere in the world. thanks quickbooks!!"
great app!. i love this app for the ease of use for my clients and me.
consider other programs.... purchased quickbooks for the fact it is easy to photograph receipts and upload, which worked for about 2 weeks and now always comes up with a error.... tried reinstalling etc, still doesn’t work. useless.
. square app is so much easier to navigate on mobile app. plus square has instant deposit. quick books i have to wait 2 buisness days at the least. horrible.
returning to qb. uk staff still rude and unhelpful.
quick books. i love it makes my business operations so much easier!
this app is harmful. support is useless or you really can’t recover the emails you sending to the clients with your invoice
. this app is awesome!!!!!
easy, convenient. make offsite transactions quick and easy.
shwetha. super app
complement to quickbooks online. this app is a complement to quickbooks online. this apple really work good for making estimates sending invoices and much more. i wish gopayment and quickbooks online were integrated or as one. other than that, great app.
"is anyone home?. i give this app one star because it doesn't let you select zero stars! all i've gotten for three days is an endless loop telling me that""to use this app you need quickbooks online"". no kidding? i'd love to find some of the application problems some of you are complaining about. at least you can turn yours on!"
. easier to send invoices via the app than it is on the computer. only flaw is i can't enter a negative number for discounts but that could just be my phone and not the app. overall i highly recommend it for anyone.
doesn’t support enough features in app. can’t generate invoice with cis. not sure i will subscribe after trial.
app is useless. receipts and notes entered in the app do not show in the register online without additional steps. it doesn’t even show there is an attachment even though i selected show attachments in settings. so what’s the point. absolutely ridiculous in this day and age.
offline. i am happy with the accounting and report model, but we prefer offline or on off software as our country not much internet cover.
. it would be nice if the app was translated in many languages...
lacking. this app has potential, but it's lacking. especially the fact that you cannot make deposits on the mobile app, only on the desktop version.
great. good app...need to be able to accept credit card or debit..i'm sure u guys are working on it
. doesn't do what the advertisements say it does. and the app has so many bugs on my new pixel it's not worth it.
junk. this app is an embarrassment to use. doesn't attach correct to emails, rude default email tags, and prints too light to fax. i used qb contractor for 10 years before being talked into ipad by apple as the way to go mobile. save your money do things right. this freezes up a lot too which if you have time to wait may be for you.
. i don't know why i didn't get this sooner very easy and i love that i can track my expenses and do my invoicing on the go.
dont waste your time. the support on this app is non existent. signing up is a slow impossible process
high caliber. awesome! makes billing and keeping track of your money infinitely easier.
i like it but am confused. the app works very well, but i am confused how to change a quote from pending to approved. when i click on edit the option does not come up
"great app!. easy to use and good customer service. i used the ""chat online"" service. very helpful and especially like that i can email a copy of the chat conversation to myself."
. great app i love it
customer service fail!. customer service is non existent look elsewhere
bug fixed. your problem with app
breathtaking!!. wow this is an incredible app. i have searched for personal finance software for a long time and it has been a major headache. using quickbooks online is amazing. if they continue to add features to the online product to rival their desktop version i recommend they move completely to the cloud!! so good.
well made basic accounting. quickbooks online has been extremely useful. i have a small contracting business, and i can record an expense in seconds, photo the receipt, create an invoice or estimate, and email these to customers. syncs instantly and automatically across multiple devices, so it's on my phone, tablet and online. the cost is tiny, and it takes care of itself  no more shoebox!
great business app. i truly do not know where my business would be without this app.
. i don't like to forcefully create account first. without using application how can i create account. other apps like this type providing use without login so why you requires login first???
. this app doesn't work! such a disappointment to say the least! i'll edit my review once the app is available for use!
thumbs up for the business help!!!. take the time to go through the orioles and this is an amazing app to help with any small business!!!
. app keeps closing right after opening even after uninstalling and then installing and also clearing app cache and data.
. apps bad after last update... you can't easily see invoice and or estimate amount anymore, you have to click each invoice & estimate to see numbers... i will be changing program's soon if not fixed.... we need to be able to easily scroll up and down the hundreds of open invoices and see where things are, not open each invoice to get information... way to timeconsuming... can't screenshot what's going on because the update before prohibits this now.... please devs fix
. very go app for on the go
love this product. i've been using qb for years. every year it get better than the year before. i won't use any other accounting software.
horrible. please update this app so it stops crashing during every use!!! also, critical updates every time you try and do anything???? getting old and frustrating. fix it!!!!! also, why when you update a transaction, it saves it from before the update, so you are doing the work twice???
. having a business that is mobile and takes cash payments this app is brilliant. can't find a way to automatically assign mileage to each sales receipt... that would be invaluable!
terrible. qbo is probably the worst software i've used since the late 1990's. it is full of bugs, feature shortcomings, and poor support. we've been working with their certified professionals for months and they barely know how the online version works. i'd strongly recommend using any other accounting platform.
. totals liability accounts into expenses in most cases and ends up double counting items.
. effectively useless. crashes after tapping on anything
. this has to be the worst app going zero customer support constantly lied too been trying for 3 weeks to send an invoice and they don't care as long as you keep paying absolute rip off...not far from being a scam spoke to managers about problems and still nothing done do don't waste your time or money...try any other program or stick to pen and paper far better and less stressful
disaster. was forced to use qb online due to always changing fees for desktop version. always crashes. hard to use. terrible. wish i could use another program. new version has new colours!! yay so practical!! doesn’t accommodate qc payroll deductions like cssnt but that’s ok, it’s colourful. intuit idiots.
. userfriendly, can create bills and estimation from mobile app too
excellent tool. ive been using it for almost a year and its easy to use and simple to understand.
okay. i'm new to doing my own bookkeeping and find this product clunky and not very easy to use. issues with importing transactions and program changing dates and the order compared to the bank. it's not very easy to see what account transfers are moving tofrom. it's hard to distinguish credits for debits. poor customer service. no good summary graphs. slow to attach receipts. multiple clicks to do basic things. cuts off file names if there too long.
. great app! very convenient. it's actually functional.
great app. can see my transactions in real time.
. so far so happy!
. trash app. havent been able to sign in for the last 2 months
. this app loads so unbelievably slowly and hangs all the time. it also has different data from the web version in the p&l reports along with not being able to categorize expenses into some chart of accounts however works fine in the web page version.
a good portable quickbooks app. the app has most of the important features, is easy to use, and is certainly a better option than trying to use the quickbooks online on an iphone. it is not a complete substitute as there are several features not available on the app,but it does allow recording time and expenses while on the road and even allows checking on and updating bank balances.
great app. this is exactly what i need to manage my small business. it also keeps my accounting bills smaller.
what happened?. this app used to work perfectly. after the last update i can't use it how i used too. if they do not fix it soon i am going to have to look into other options
. the app doesnt refresh my inventory or reports as the update is done via the app or the website
. this app doesn't work! such a disappointment to say the least! i'll edit my review once the app is available for use! still not working!
user friendly. quickbooks has saved me so much time and stress! i have a small business and tried excel and failed miserably. but when i switched to quickbooks it took me no time to figure out it could do everything i needed and more! also the customer service is wonderful, anytime i have called for help because i'm terrible at technology they walk me through step by step without making me feel stupid. i'm so happy i switched to quickbooks!!!
crashes. a lot.. new upgrade crashes. a lot. allowed me on just long enough to click 'leave a review'. then crashed. again.
. make sure you know what services they provide, as customer support likely knows less than you do.
total crap. this app doesn't work. it shows numbers which doesn't make sense, you can't rely on it. i just go to safari web and login to my quick books account. please change it if you can.
. your app is garbage. i've had to reset my password 4 times and have the verification code texted and phoned to me several times and still nothing. thanks for wasting 1 hour of my time that i cannot get back😠😠😠😠😠
great app!. great app!
"can't add unit with quality and rate in invoice. online version does not allow customisation of fields. invoice doesn't show ""unit"" with quantity and rate as a result invoice are unusable in real world. hope developer address these issue at priority before we users move to other applications."
almost usless. the app does not show all the info like logging in from a pc. also scrolling up or down on a page is very glitchy. quickbooks has a lot of work to do on making this app useful.
fix log in problems. the latest update made logging in extremely difficult. i am no longer able to use my pin or fingerprint even though they are both enabled in the app.
no invoices. not very useful.
very good app. good
excellent accounting software. exactly meets my needs as an ecommerce professional. the reports are limited to pl and balance sheet, but that's is the heart of what you need. i've had it over 2 years now and love it.
great app. great app for busy people! this is really useful for trades people and consultants. highly recommend, super easy to use
marcela hayden. i don’t know how i would get buisness done with out quickbooks, and the app on the go makes it possible for my family to run our buisness and grow in success. thank you quickbooks
no link. why is there no simple way to link it to computer to send information. who made this useless app
small business owner. absolutely awful. i was forced to switch to online because of a fatal error of the desktop version on mac seirra. there are so many bugs and things that aren't available on online that were on the desktop. i literally call support for 2hrs a day.
. love the app, makes running my business so much easier.
efficient app. as a bookkeeper i use qbo for all of my clients as well as for my personal account. it just keeps getting better and better. accepting transactions is a breeze as is setting up invoices, paying bills, and writing estimates. one feature my clients find helpful is the receipt attachment. i would highly recommend this app for anyone who uses qbo.
. i don't want to get charged tomorrow! i went to manage my subscription to cancel then an error came up and i've still got the message saying payment comes out tomorrow without an option to change it. the button has gone.
very good for any kind of business!. quickbooks is great app for managing the everyday finances. it's very fast to send invoices, with this app all income and expenses are simple and quick.
. still learning the ropes. so far so good. being able to submit quotations efficiently and itemized makes all the difference. quite easy to learn and keep track of expenses.
. great app. it has been essential to the daily operation of my business. thanks quickbooks
negative stars.... emails won't send to customers... misspelled quantity on invoices... not complicated to fix, no customer service, destroyed my management system, i regret switching...
. i got this to sync with my online account and it doesn't. also it won't let me add a sales tax. and so what's the point if i hafta enter everything into separate accounts.
. easy to use. the only reason i did give it five stars was because you can't add custom fields to the customer data.
. after eading all the problems and seeing 90% of the reviews being 1 star im going to save a headache on this scam app should be taken off the market or sued for false advertising and costing people thousands of dollars. all the responses from support sound like they are prewritten for the complaints. please take app off the market and quit ruing the admin side of peoples hard work to start a business.
too many error messages. for what you pay for a quickbooks online account, this app for ipad and iphone is really disappointing. i get an error message almost every single time i try and enter a new transaction. sometimes it works despite the error message, sometimes it doesn't. but i get the error every time. i can't even access the banking functions as i get an error message and nothing will load. the only function that seems to work properly is the reports section.
. seriously? this is the best you can do? ! so limited on basic functions. *updated review nice try quickbooks on the reply...no, your laughable update is ridiculous! not to mention the mobile device website lockout to access via mobile browser.... taking away another star for bad public relations. welcome to 1996 if you try to rely on this app for your 2014 business.
not bad. convenient app. not as functional as quickbooks online, but it adds to its subscription's value.
easy to use. well set out and easy to use
great program. i love quickbooks. i run payroll and create estimates, invoices and sales receipts. i am able to link all my accounts even my square account easily and seamlessly. the customer service representatives are competent and friendly.
pretty good could be great. this ties in nicely with the desktop version. it's not 5* purely because of the actual software not the app itself. the customising of the invoice isn't great and adding previous invoices when you first start isn't great but if you're not worried about that it works well!
. i was so scared of handling my businesses finances before this app. between the ease of use of the app, and all of the handy tutorials and videos on youtube from them i actually feel like i know what i'm doing
. so quick and simple!
slow and buggy. disappointed in app. doesn't correlate well with desktop version. slow to load information and sometimes won't update accounts.
brian burke. very user friendly!
doesn’t load (for me). app doesn’t load. tap on the icon and nothing happens. i hope no one else has this problem.
. nice app
i love this app. i love all of the features it currently has. i wish we had more of the controls we had from our qbo web version. 4616  i love that i can now see my check registers & a few other things have been updated. added the final star!
horrible. constant crashes at the worst of times!!! aarrrggghhhh!
. love this app, keeps track of all my expenses and payments from clients. easiest way to do estimates and invoices as well.
excellent app. keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
. keeps logging me out otherwise really nice app
emailing invoices. this is an excellent app for tracking income and expenses. however, whenever i try to email invoices, it gives an error message that it is 'unable to send message'. will give five stars if this issue is worked out.
. dashboard unable to load after dozens of reinstalls, reboots and even on another phone entirely. ever since the new redesign the app has been riddled with intermittent loading of the dashboard to now nonexistent. tmobile, oneplus 6t tmobile, samsung galaxy note 10+
good but few bugs. i can see some of the expenses and bills of some suppliers but not all. i would think that if it syncs it should sync for all no?
. great app, very useful
not trustworthy. quickbooks has some issues with taking multiple accounts under the same email. i can not access my account because my email was used to open a second trial and i can not access my data any longer. choose better accounting software, overall. this app has no visible way to logout or troubleshoot.
almost perfect. it would be perfect if there was an overview dashboard that showed outstanding invoices like the online dashboard.
excellent app.. simple to use and very affordable.
. just unistalled and reinstalled the app hopefully it is going to work. after doing over 70 invoices it stopped working dashboard showed blank 😕
. ive been in business for years greatperfectawesome...invoices on the smartphone that save accross all devices!
i am discussed with your country list. you have palestine listed. it is not even a country. israel is where i live. i will be blasting this all over the web and deleting this app from my phone. thank you for your reply but again, palestine does not exist. it hasn't since 1948
simple and efficient. this makes invoicing on the go so simple. i love that it syncs with my computer and i can take a photo of receipts and it adds them to my expenses. very convenient
subscription renewal poorly thought out. i have been using qbonline for more than a year. it picked the worst time to time out and demand a subscription renewal. further it requires multiple logins and you must be st your desk top. nothing more frustrating than what amounts to a software crash when you are trying to get things done. huge fail quickbooks
. exelent app!!! excellent app it works for my small business if one tech and one office lady.i just can't figure out how to add small items i use to repair i.e. couplings tees nineties and what they fall under. other than that i love this app.
great app. i have numerous clients on this platform and it suits all forms and situations.
so easy to use!. such an easy app to use, these guys have simplified bookkeeping down from something i wouldn't dare touch, to being able to raise invoices from my phone and connect my bank accounts, no hassles at all.
. pathetic app works too slow with a fast internet connection.. takes hours to get refreshed highly disappointed
. this app makes my life so much easier.
. downloading problems and unresponsive customer service
still doesn't work. touch id is still not working. must manually log in to the app each time i use it throughout the day. this is super annoying not to mention time consuming. and time is money!
. preparing to start a business and this software was rated the best. i took a 5 day class for 4hours. i was so happy that i downloaded this app and used in class too.
. best software for any business!
need help. i have problem with the data sync status. it written unable to get data. i can't even sent this message to your contact.
. great app. i wish it could link to the desk top version. i use it primarily for invoicing on the go but the bookkeeper uses the desk top version.
. good mobile app app has a problem switching from screen to menu. tends to freeze up and close itself
. qbo much improved over original launch product, and tge app has brought qbo up.to date. i love the ability to upload receipts tgat immediately sync with qbo and match to vendorsexpenses. qbos ability to have multiple ysrs working simultaneously is huge . realtime collaboration with my bookkeeper and accountant is now easy. no more thirdparty file sharing apps and concerns about version control. with the app i can now monitor financials on the fly. highly recommend!
excellent mobile app. hopefully they will integrate a few more features soon to make it complete.
gloria. unable to create an account. supposedly i already have an account. i've never installed this app before.
management. good online on the go, but it has too many breakdowns, constantly has crashes, and makes it frustrating when you needed, if there were another online app that i will use i probably would consider on changing, for something simple is probably the right one for many customer that used the app.
. love the invoice function on this app
really helpful!!. i am a computer engineer and being able to make estimates and invoices in the field has really helped me!
great app but.... i love the app; works great for invoices and customer information on the go... however it would be nice if i could get more detailed reports and accounting information on it too... that's my only real complaint but you can still use a computer for that  miss those reports when i'm away from it though.
. very good, i am on trial not sure how much full experience will cost, i'll update when i can
taking too long to integrate with desktop version. all the press releases state that quickbooks is usable across all platforms, it is only part usable on the ipad version and even less on the iphone. have been waiting weeks for it have full functionality on the ipad.
owner. quickbooks online, so far we like everything about except for the fact that it works like crap on an ipad. please come out with an update and patch work soon it's not worth it.
owner. has bugs but no more back ups .no more lost files
good app. very detailed , im no pro @ accounting but i am teaching myself this app. its very in depth and i like it.
. pitiful. they bricked my account, broken for over a week. third world software.
easy to use. great app to use
. great with some improvements would be nice if invoice generated from app had the pay online link like the invoices i send from computer. is there a setting that i need to change to activate this feature?
. still waiting on a transaction from last week. was told a lie. biggest mess i have ever seen. stay away from go payment . now it seems they kicked me off quickbooks from this bad review. way to go quickbooks
. awesome app pretty convenient and user friendly.
cool app. really great app. gives access to everything you'd want to get to from your phone.
great wee app. i've had this app a few week very easy to work with.
. simple to use
great functionality!. i have been a qb desktop user for many years. the new online version is really simple. i am still working to find the pieces i know in the desktop version, but all the basics are there. found some good you tube videos to help me learn. love the connection to my banking.
. sometimes an app or service gets worse with time. this is one of them. it is stupidly expensive and incredibly unintuitive. please fix the random sign in and sales receipt bug and improve the ui or i will find another product.
couldn't live without it. love this app. makes my life as an accountant easy! now that we have shifted our business to a more mobile one!
very disappointed.. right now i'm looking for something that can run with my business. looking for more features less bugs and more useful.
. great app and fairly easy to use
excellent!. this is a fab piece of software for both selfemployed and accountants to sync all your activity in one place.
the software has been a nightmare recently using iphone and ipad keeps saying i haven't paid. i've written to emails and had absolutely no response to either no refunds either because i can't get the software to work unless i'm in mice studios on my laptop which is being fixed currently i won't be with me for the next four weeks so how i'm supposed to do any invoicing i have no idea this is absolutely ridiculous use sage...
mr. brilliant accountancy software,simple to use in the office or on the go.
very disappointed. ever since i updated it doesn't save my expenses and crashes a lot. very disappointed.
terrible. try to do estimates on the quickbooks for ipad. it is easier to do on the quickbooks for iphone. intuit needs to get some people like myself with an office any where that using qb online very hard and heavy to beta test there software.
one step submittal group. very good online software
. i can't receive payment directly to my bank account. somehow it goes to undeposited funds even if a choose cheque or direct debit.
love it. this app works great for me.. .
. easy to use. mobile app is good for searching previously created invoices. i prefer desktop version for using all other tools.
app is handy, but buggy. recurring invoices are a wreck. i have had the same issue for 2 years with quickbooks resetting my settings every month and automatically sending invoices to my clients without approval.
. great app
j'adore. accès directement aux comptes bancaires. me fais sauvez énormément d'argent.
. love this app.so simple to use. saves you so much time with your paperwork keep up the great work guys😀😀
excellent companion to your quickbooks online subscription.. i rated this app lower than 5 stars when i first reviewed it. purely because it showed my invoices in usd and not gbp. unfortunately there was no way to change it once set. recently i had to completely reset my phone. this gave me the opportunity to install the app fresh. this time it picked up my local currency correctly. so, 5stars from me now.
. great app. obviously nots as many features as browser access but an amazing app nonetheless.
excellent program. we are extremely happy with this program, it has made our company administrators live so much easier.
. doesn't open, tried reinstalling and clearing cache. used to work.
really convenient. love this app. i'm trying it as a trial and i'm sold. we will be getting the monthly service for sure.
un most para las empresas. la mejor app y software para llevar la contabilidad de tu empresa. sencillo y en línea! te calcula todo limpio y sin problemas
. does the trick. is easy to use and does not cost and arm and a leg. i'd reccomend.
. try to subscribe to take cc payments got denied because of the service we sell. we are a sports league that take payments from teams and players. well gotta go with square i guess.
. good but could be great i tend to use the app just to get a summary. would like it to have more of the features that qbo.
disappointed. do not download this app. i'm sorry i did. extremely flawed.
where is the cost of the app?. where is the cost of the app. you gave me all kind of information but not the price of the app!!???
. quickbooks allows me to be able to manage my business while i'm at my computer, or while i'm on the road. the analytics allow me to see the highs and lows of my business and it allows me to see my biggest expenses search that i can mitigate if necessary
great app but needs improvement. there are various things you can’t do on app .example you can’t set recurring transaction, use batch actions for reminders. for indian users , they have not launched quickbooks payment. there is no customer portal ,there should be system for sending invoice and reminder link via sms overall it is good app and all does the basic stuff but should look forward to integrate above stuff as well
. handy app!
brilliant. brilliant app. so happy that i've migrated over to quick books.
all of my clients love it!. the ease of use is fantastic. i love that i can quickly load multiple accounts. the qbo app makes my job so much easier because my clients love tracking expenses and sending invoices on the go!
crashes. keeps crashing. can't use app at all.
fix the app!!!. this app use to work great until the last update! please fix asap!
. easy entry method. looking 4ward2 sending out invoices and payment methods.
on point. this app is on point and efficient at helping take care of financial details, needed to avoid tax issues.
a whole new level of deluxe. this has taken our construction company to the next level. the reporting, receipt feature and ease of use has made it simple to track p and l of each job
crash. your latest update is crashing. it doesn't let me open the app. please fix immediately
the speedy man, owner. i run my business on quickbook online for a year, and i never had any issues. i suggest, to new subscribers, getting familiar with the desktop version and having a basic accounting background , we can perform a ton of tasks on it. afterwards, we can start using the mobile app.
. great app. no problems
. easy to use. minor software glitches occassionally but great !
missing too much functionality. basic features like looking at an account are missing. my chart of accounts are listed but clicking to view transactions says this account not viewable in the mobile app.
great app.. i am new to quickbook, but found this app as very helpful tool to run a small business, no matter where i am, at home, in the office or on the road. thanks +++++
great app always adding new features. great app always adding new features.!
won't allow adding services to invoice. i called tech support because i could not create an invoice for a customer. they had me uninstall & reinstall qbo app. it still wouldn't work. he said they're aware of the problem. it's still not fixed a week later.
quickbooks online rocks!. setting up qbonline to invoice, purchase, and banking downloads makes it possible to be completely mobile with your business! to reconcile accounts you'll need to access the full power of qbonline on a browser, preferably on your laptop or desktop.
perfect software for the right companies. i absolutely love it! i have a small freelance design company, so i'm billing for services and commissions. there is nothing i need that it doesn't do and do well. i don't need inventory, estimates or payroll, so this program is about as friendly to me as it could possibly be.
crashes. constantly crashes and doesnt work as promised.
. great app
very impressed!!!. this is well worth it. we are more on top of our books. it definitely has been a time saver and we love the pay bills from a click option. i really like the alerts to my overdue invoices too.
why use the app when you it lacks the features of the website. you can’t change the status of in invoice on the app and must be done online only. this is a major flaw in the app. once i do my taxes i will no longer be using quick books, because of the enforced complexity the system is rendered mostly useless. the app needs to have complete functionality of the site.
crashes now. i used to love it. i got a new iphone updated it and installed quickbooks and it crashes every time i sign in. it says i have to download my company info every time i open the app. it takes 510 minutes to do so.
more than convenient, it's necessary. having the app makes it so much easier to do business on the go. you can send estimates and invoices before the client meeting has even ended. efficient and essential!
great app. super friendly and sweet app
. terrible app. really let's you down. i've toyed to log in numerous times only to be told my session has expired.
crashes since ios13. i can no longer open my quickbooks on my phone since the ios 13 update has been released.
app crashes after each action. i use the desktop version most of the time but when i need to use it when away, it’s really frustrating that the app shuts after every action making doing anything painfully cumbersome.
worse than useless. i downloaded this app as use quickbooks daily, the pc software is great! the apple app is such a waste of time, i can’t access any reports and the info it does show me is a waste of my time just a load of numbers that don’t mean anything. no thought has gone into this app i suspect it’s just a tick box exercise creating an app...
needs more bank options. this app doesn’t support my bank (becu) si in that case it’s worthless to me. please refund my money thank you!
. great app does everything you need it to do on the go. perfect!
. this app needs a lot of work.
fantastic features. all the features that works under this single app. i used to work with excel spreadsheet, invoice app, expense app to complete the business on the go. now everything has being simplify into this one subscription saving me time and double entry. i am absolutely happy that i can email invoice, take pictures and enter expense using my iphone. best of all these is update into the cloud. great excellent accounting software nothing comes close after trying others accounting software.
great small business tool. very easy to navigate and enter information. i can enter data on my home computer and then access it with my phone when i'm not in the office. great app
master electrician. this app has done everything that i have asked of it. fantastic of estimating, invoicing and receiving payments in the field while on the job site. really saves me time.
. not all customer payments showing on android, on iphone was no issues except some crashes from time to time and signing out by itself.
. incredibly buggy, takes forever to open and crashes on every action. cannot move from xero to quickbooks while the apps remains this bad.
. i can't use this app at all because it will not sync to my bank. not the app or any of the services offered. i'm trying to cancel all of my subscriptions and services and it seems impossible to do. directions for canceling do not work. i have yet to see any cancellation choices in any drop down menus. i'm paying for services that i can not use and unable to cancel which is a scam.
bad update. this update is very bad. activities don't come up anymore. have to navigate to long to find stuff... i don't need to see company details first. i need to see customer activities.... this is such a waste of time and very frustrating. now i have to search for a new program.
. since i have gotten this app it's made my life a whole lot better .
. does everything i need and more!
great app. great integration. very easy
overall good product. not having access to the entire online tools on the app makes for complicated tasks at times. the online browser does not run fluently with a safari browser so if i need anything beyond basics i need to get to a pc.
. good app very nice and handy
do it if you can get it to work. i loved the mobil app but intuit doesn't support it any longer. they want you to do the $54.00month hosting instead. i called twice today to try to get this app working and they said it wasn't their app. if you can get this to sync with you qb software, go for it.
amazing. this is so much easier to use and access. we are out in the field more time than at the office and to be able to email am invoice to a customer in front of him is awesome.
so much better than sage. we moved from sage to this and haven’t looked back. the app is better and the links to banks work (unlike sage). the help and support is better than sage too. all in all, well worth a trial.
. couldn't run a business without this app.
where's the touch password?. i use keychain so my quickboks password on my mac is super random, with dashes and strange symbols. i use quickbooks on my iphone so i can quickly add expenses when on the road and don't have a mac nearby. please add the touch password feature back in so the iphone app is convenient again.
owner. 365 bookkeeping & payroll. absolutely love the qboa and the qbo mobile app. user friendly.
mobile app. you cannot check your inventory or edit invoices from the mobile app.
can't create new invoice. very troublesome considering this was an app i raved to people about its efficiency yet now i can't even create a new invoice and earn money... just paid for premium too. very disappointed and would like my money back for each day the app is rendered useless.
. used to work perfect ever since update it's very unreliable. can't log into app reliably. it often locks me out right when i'm standing in a customer's house trying to invoice them or locks me out when i need to go through my client list for a phone number etc. i suggest you consider competitors software until the app becomes stable again.
. their cancellation process is brutal. thea button to do it myself online wasn't available, waited on hold forever for the phone number support page said to call, chat didn't answer forever then replied then immediately ended the chat because i didn't respond right away, chat after that kept delaying cancelling (i'm still not cancelled, had the time to write all this while trying to  waiting for chat to cancel)
not working with ios 13. just crashes
reduced feature set. previous version:the feature set of the web based app is not matched. (previous mentioned currency and time records). update: removed a lot of preexisting functionality and did not add any missing functions. much worse than before. cannot find a list of invoices due to a supplier. clicking on a particular supplier brings up only the address particulars.
zero stars 10.3 is junk. i used this app several times a day. i run my business on this app. since april 10th i cannot access my data. my business is suffering and intuit cannot fix it. i still have to pay. tech support at intuit  quickbooks recommended i switch to a android. (i doesn't work on my iphone or ipad) i really do not want to invest in new hardware. stay away from intuit they do not care and offer no solutions.
. excellent app. i've been self employed for many years but have only starting using quickbooks recently and it saves me so much time...
. it is simple to use
inferior to qb online on desktop. qb app on ipad or android does not not have even half of the features that qb online has on a desktop. i can manage basic invoicing, basic expenses, see transactions, and pull up basic reports... everything about this app is basic. i have to actually be on my desktop to access the full features of qb online. very dissapointed.
touch id still doesn't work. despite what intuit claims about the new update. smh.
great app. saves me a lot of time. very fluid with payments and bank transfers.
amazing. this app makes my business. hats off to the developer
service date is still broken. has had this problem for months and a fix has yet to be included in an update. will be not be staying with quickbooks.
. mobil app to slow
sad. please bring back the mobile app. the online needs improvements. going back to spreadsheets thank you qb.
best way to get paid.. easy, professional invoices, cheap and most importantly time saver
works great. this app works perfect for recording our small farms purchases and sales. it is very easy and convenient to use.
makes me look like a pro!. i'm just a dude that runs a small business. i'm good at what i do, but i'm not an accountant or bookkeeper. quickbooks online let's me do what i'm good at and not worry about the details.
perfect!!!. this software is perfect!!!!
awful. never updates correctly. cannot find my existing customers. just cumbersome. not enough options for menus.. see above frustrations
great app. really like this app but switching from iphone to an android device i miss the expense option in the app. for the iphone you could input an expense on the app with the android you can not. i would like to see that added for the android app.
alcatel one touch. great app for small business.
fantastic software !. this has made my life a whole lot easier. invoice and estimates on the go. i really feel in control of my accounts.
crashed when entered a sales transaction. downloaded this app to see if i could use it instead of at a computer and the app crashed as soon as i tried to enter a sales transaction. i tried to enter in the receipt type and it crashed
a little awkward.... it has the functionality but the ui is awkward. it's also very difficult joggling between the different expense accounts.
. you need this app if your running a business
no american express support. we use american express for expenses and we cannot manage these transactions within the app. not even see them. the app tells me to view quickbooks online in a web browser to manage amex transactions. this makes this app very useless.
improved quickbooks. it has many features than can help small businesses. the app can help you to organize, make use of spare time to do work.
great app. this is getting better with each update it makes. i you this app everyday to run my practice and it makes it very convenient because i'm constantly on the road and i don't have to sit at my desk just to enter expenses or send invoices to clients.
. it collects all your information first then it tells you it's paid app.
. update... application remains impossible to use on both ios and android devices. invoice matching for banking transactions is painful particularly when there are many invoices to match to a single banking transaction and application seems to refresh in the background which causes matches to be lost before completing. not worth installing till these issues are fixed meaning web based invoice matching is the only option... have wasted hours of my time on both ios and android based applications...
. simple, easy and quick. easy to use and keep your books. highly recommended
so far so good.... it is working as advertised. would like to have a bit more color and design to the invoices. not complaining, just suggesting.
. great app very user friendly. the mobile app is still a bit limited as i cant do statements from it but once on the laptop everything can be done
bills for suppliers cannot be viewed. as the title suggests. this is a big negative point for me.
easy to use. no training necessary. links to desktop. love it
. best app
. i am still fresh with this app but sounds good to me
love it.. i love this app it is very convenient and works so nice when i'm on the run for quick access
good but needs more. i wish i can record bills in the expences area, and on the banking it will be nice to be able to do transfers, and deposits. other than that this app is been working ok for me.
cis transactions. cannot carry out cis transactions in the app for some reason, you have to use the web version. this is really annoying and somewhat inconvenient. other than that, a great app....
great for my business. the app makes checking banking records and status of transfers easy. the app is also very intuitive. highly recommend.
good so far. it seems good so far, will update later when i actually have time to form an opinion. it keeps begging for a review so here..
. vg and lot much improved with very good customer care support. thankx.
. can you print from this app
loved it. does exactly what you want. needs more access to desktop features but generally great app
great. had some problems at first, but i was helped promptly and the problem was fixed immediately. great support team.
. great app!
easier than i thought. works well for what i need it for, and makes tracking accounts simple.
great  when it works.. app crashes often and has trouble down loading data
". i laughed at one of the quickbooks employees response to the app being slow... they said their goal is to make it as convenient as the qbo app... lol lol bad comparison. online version is tragically slow, short of (what should be) obvious capabilities, even some quickbooks older versions have had for years. and, when challenged, their tech support essentially says ""we are quickbooks if you don't do it our way or using our workaround then you must be doing it wrong"""
does what it should. i have being using it for a year and it really does what it should. i get my banking done and it thing is great when exporting to my account.
. i used to be able to pull reports (profit & loss and balance sheet). that feature seems to no longer be available on the latest app version. i don't know why they would remove such an important feature. it would be nice to run other reports as well.
. one of my favorite apps this app is so convenient. i have the ability to check my book anywhere at anytime.
no mileage tracking. false advertising. the mileage tracking screen shot is from the self employed app, not the small business app
great!. continues to impress and improve on this very useful app. i use it daily for bids, invoices and expenses. the addition of the ability to record expenses and photograph receipts has made my life so much more easy. and to be able to quickly add clients, easy estimates and quick invoices and finally receive payments is unbelievable and wonderful.
different. this is so different than qbo that it renders itself useless. i cannot rely on it for any accurate information. the only feature that is good is the receipt capture.
. just was on hold for 20 minutes and the issue is not resolved. the app is not allowing me to save information. also the online platform is not working with third party apps with the new tax rates in saskatchewan (reciept bank) been waiting for that fix for 3 weeks.
. great app... easy to use
logo input. is there an advanced function to insert company logo in the paid version . if yes i will consider subscribing
. the app is not updating on my phone
. love how easy this app make doing business.
just works. great app! no complaints, but my business isn't very big. looking forward to quickbooks scaling up with me!
efficient app. as a bookkeeper i use qbo for all of my clients as well as for my personal account. it just keeps getting better and better. accepting transactions is a breeze as is setting up invoices, paying bills, and writing estimates. one feature my clients find helpful is the receipt attachment. i would highly recommend this app for anyone who uses qbo.
. i really like it for the most part.. would love to see the invoice number self populate when going to send out the email
easy to use but missing some features. it's a great app but missing some features. i need to see quantity for my products and be able to create purchase orders from vendors and receive inventory.
. awesome app for small business owners that need to be on the move.
"good but not perfect.. a feature is missing that you get on the website for example, search i can't search invoices in the app through ""memo"". why!!!!??? please fix or add a ""memo"" search option, please!!!"
highly recommend. i highly recommend this app. i run my business with quickbooks online and use this app daily. i use it to create estimates and invoices mostly but also look up look up costumers balances and run reports.
dont use free bank transfer!. it says you will receive funds in 23 business days but they don’t tell you it will take 23 days until they process it and then another 23 days to process it to your account. would have been worth the 3 hour drive to pick up the check. don’t use the free bank transfer just tell customers to transfer bank to bank instead of using quickbooks accounting bank transfers.
great app!. very userfriendly and convenient. great for people who are needing to create invoices and estimates and track expenses. the iphone app is fantastic!
works amazing! i love being able to attach pictures right to my expenses when i enter them. it is also really nice to be able to enter expenses on the road. it makes bookkeeping a lot easier!
great to use.. great to use. would be nice to have a few more features on my iphone that i have while on a computer but still gets most tasks done very easily but it could be i haven't taken the time to really learn it! very easy to use and a lot like the desktop version
don't like new update. i prefer buttons actions on the bottom than puede corner and still missing two things, send invoices by text, fax, edit or view notes online
. awesome app and integration all around!!!
. ever since update the app doesn't work & my clients constantly complain about it. especially as it was a feature that sold the software to them in the first place! please sort it out!
employee. love quickbooks but really want to incorporate it into my service vehicles please make a employee version
. rubbish app as never let's me update my bank transactions. i go to refresh and it simply comes up saying none and all up to date when it's not. makes the app unusable for me.
won't connect to qb online since update.. i've been using qb for ipad with few issues to date, until the latest update. now, i'm on a job, trying to invoice a customer and can not since the app will not connect to qb online.
crashes all the time and there’s no way to ask for help.. this app crashes every time i update my iphone, even when i update the app. don’t even bother trying to contact qb about it, they’ll tell you to uninstall and reinstall (like you don’t know) and then that’s about the extent of their support.
nothing but glitches on my ipad. really not worth it nothing but problems one operating on ipad
top notch program. i use it everyday for business! easy to use and cut my estimating time in half. i can even send estimates from the program. definitely worth the money.
. works better than the pc version, easy to track expenses etc
changed the way we do business. i love this app. we needed something that we could easily use in the field. we can create estimates, invoices, receive payments and even attach check images to those payments. our productivity has skyrocketed. quickbooks has figured out the mobile accounting software. customers for life.
response to the quickbooks online account app. i love quickbooks accountant online program; but i noticed that there are limits to the quickbooks accountant online app capabilities compared to what the downloadable online quickbooks accountant software program could do. otherwise, really happy with online quickbooks accountant program!!
. quickbooks makes my life so much easier for writing amd sending estimates and invoices. there are so many other things that quickbooks can do that im slowly learning. im writing so many estimates and getting so much work from easier estimate and invoice writing its really hard for me to get the time sit down amd learn everything else quickbooks has to offer.
life saver. i would not know what to do without this app! yeah i would have to fight through receipts every month to balance month end report. with the app i just input the info when i make the purchase and it makes it so much easier. recommend the app 110%.
great app for busy employersemployees. your features are reduced and it's not the exact same as when you use a pc but it is still really nice. i would not be want it to be as in depth anyways it's nice and simple. i would recommend it to anybody that needs quickbooks on the go. we do a lot of work in the field and it is really nice to do estimates and email them to the customer while standing right next to them.
good app poor customer service. was trying to switch over my account settings and the representative i had helping me seemed very lost and wasn’t of any help. still confused on how to swap my account to a different package and receive refunds on duplicate charges. really quite frustrated. besides that the app itself provides the services i need.
. more nicer with the update but i still can't give my customers discounts, i wish it would let me make a negative quantity or rate while making and invoice.
. great app. very helpful for my small business.
not bad, but needs improvement. this app is good but needs improvement. improvements are mostly needed with the bank connections. i have to constantly tell my clients to update their login information in quickbooks for their bank accounts. this makes it's frustrating and time consuming for me and my clients. the app should also make it easier to do the same things as the web version.
login error. useless if you can't even trust it to login properly.
love this app. helps a lot with my work
. account function is good . but technical support & help customer service is poor, not responding. wrost app
"so disappointing. in a never ending but now predictably disappointing offering that intuit calls its cloudbased offering ""quickbooks online"" we have a fantastically buggy and seamfull application with even more limited functionality than the web application. unfortunately it's a ""beggars can't be choosers"" scenario yet again as intuit continues to monopolize the market by utilizing profits for acquisition of competitors, rather than listening to customers to develop it's cloudbased core competencies. shakes head in disappointment."
wow!. really cool app! it's linked on all my device! i can make invoices on my phone and send it to my clients directly from email! cool stuff!
add items?. there's no where to add items, only when i make an invoice it let's you add items, but there's no items list so you can quickly choose from lists, so every time i make an invoice i have to add an item manually instead of choosing from a list?
. doesn't work on pixel 3xl. crashes as soon as it starts every time. wave works great though!
. great app, works good
. great app for running my business
. great app!
. great, can create invoices on phone and send on the spot
good software. this software is very awesome. i work for the company but also use it for my own personal budgeting and it is extremely helpful but there are still a lot of bugs that need to be worked out with this app so that all the information updates correctly.
best accounting app. perfect for any small business. never had any problem, never crashes. only need more invoicing templates.
. very nice.
it's only a trial. this looks brilliant until you've set up the account only to find out that it's a 30 trial. by that time they've got your email. well done them. clever!! immediately deleted
it was barely ok to start with!. i had used quickbooks for several years and then went to the online version. i liked the features it had, but really didn’t like the 600.00 a year fee. for the most part it worked, but never all of the time. then when they raised the subscription price to 720.00 a year, that was it. i said good bye and found another program. no regrets!
. i can't remember the last time i was this frustrated with an app andor company. more often than not, the app andor the website do not work. they sure don't have any issues with their autorenew and collecting money from users. they just can't figure out how to provide a product that works and customer service that can, or even wants to, help. think long and hard before choosing quickbooks for your business. i wish i had.
time entry. i would really use this app if time entry was part of it. that would be something i could really use on the road.
. i cant even login. the apps crush everytime i am trying to login!!
. worst app don't use it. it shows us a very professional look and feel but truth is that it doesn't work in android mobile in india and online version of desktop is totally sucks just because it is very slow. these peoples are making fool of us totally.
very useful and easy. love it
. underrwhelmed this doesn't do anything but receipts and invoices. does anyone's company run without reports or balances. there is no way this is helpful! reloaded thinking something may have changed....not. no account balances. no reports. so very disappointed still.
crash books pro. this terrific app asks you every few minutes to rate their program knowing that you want to tell the world how you can't send out an invoice without the app crashing. *update* i am having more issues with the app then ever. i can only assume quickbooks is either more useless then i thought. or they are retaliating for my review of their product. i have never had any program work this bad and i have worked it.
great app really does work for my business. really easy to do my accounts and invoices.
dirty tactics for subscription. unsubscribing to this app is so difficult. an error prompt always appears everytime i process unsubscribing. but if it’s any form of purchase, upgrading, downgrading, anything other than unsubscribing works just fine. no reply from their customer service since i contacted them a few weeks ago. i hope other people who has the same problems with this app comes forward so this developer stops milking money from unwilling customers.
chrashing in estimates. the app is great, only hiccup is that it restarts as soon as i go into opening a new estimate
must have!. absolutely vital to my daily business. clients are impressed when i produce an invoice on the spot and process their credit cards before i leave the job site.
limited features. i’m not sure why quickbooks decided to create an app that is so much different than the web version or the mac version. errors and limited information is all this thing is good for. and, if you decide you would rather just use the website, you pretty much get redirected to this junky app.
kinda cumbersome. this app isn't very intuitive and there are a lot of free apps that do the same thing.
i love this app. easy to use, transfers well from computer to cell phone. absolutely love it.
it's not working. it's not working in india for aondrid os .. useless app
fairly useless. this app is difficult to navigate. it doesn't come close to mimicking qbo for pcs. the functionality is very limited. it's ok for looking up some things but difficult to update info such as logging checks or deposits.
app notifications. app has issues which never get fixed. always receive a bug upon opening, can’t connect to bank account until refreshed, deleted invoices won’t delete, i no longer receive notifications when customers make payments. tried reinstalling, nothing works. how do i get this corrected?
sweet baby jesus this is exactly what i need. it has never been so easy to stay so financially organized. as someone who os chronically disorganized this app is a blessing. definitely worth the price when you need to record your expenses and write receipts, invoices and all sorts of other business related things to be professional.
ios 13 not supported. the app will not even start!
. not useful in india at all
app crashes. this app crashes or cannot save my data on every entry i make. horrible app!!
pretty complete finance from your phone. i'm not too sure about the need for a separate app for payroll, but this does work as advertised for the most part.
doesn’t work on ios 13. so many bugs:  can’t send reminders  can’t modify invoices ( reaching invoice number limit?)  can’t send invoices( email is too long? )
crashes with galaxy s7 edge android 6.0.1. i have a new samsung galaxy s7 edge running android 6.0.1. every time i try to log into the app it crashes when signing in and offers to send a report. but the send crash report button results in blue screen. have to force close. very frustrated as i am used to using the app constantly. update: customer support was able to assist with the issue once i emailed them.
. this app runs silently in the background and tracks your vehicle movement. it used 47 gigs of data in two months.
. great small business app
. really frustrated, do not buy this app through google, once you setup you account through good you can not upgrade you account or transfer it to a regular subscription. so i'm just stuck with what i have....
great for business. this is a great app to use for daily business
horrible tech support. they couldn't even transfer my desktop file to quickbooks online. after one month they called me at 8pm to say it can't be done.
. customer service is absolutely horrible. signed up yesterday online. found out customizing invoices function has been broken for 3 months. call this morning to cancel subscription and get a refund. they're answer basically was we've got your money we're not going to refund it. you have been warned stay away from quickbooks
. crashed out. would not set even up account. lame. uninstalled.
. what a faff! absolute joke, can't create items on android useless
actually professional now. i was using word to create invoices, then excel to keep track of when they were paid. now it's all done in one place and even sends a professional looking invoice to my clients! i should've moved to quick books long ago!
what a joke.. can't add notes to customers. buggy! cant print. awful. if you are moving from qb desktop, think again! there's not even an easy way to just view today's business. no reports in app. useless.
scott. i find the app to be a great addition to the desktop version. having access to all invoices and customers through my phone is excellent.
. makes billing simple on the road
security update  unable to sign in. since the security update for sign in features i'm unable to sign into my account using the app.. defeats the purpose of having it aug 23, 2016  just redownloaded the app and have full access once again. oct 20, 2016  unable to select cash, check or credit account to pay an expense.
epic help. this app is very helpful for me it is very good
nada funciona , nada de soporte y ningún tutorial. soy economista y sé cómo trabajar con aplicaciones y ordenadores . es una de las peores aplicaciones que conozco y si quiero saber cómo hacerlo no hay tutorías o quia que explica lo que quiero hacer . no la compres
does not work with desktop pro plus 2017. i didn't know i had to spend even more for the qb license and upgrade to the online version.
. love it! makes my accounting software much easier. no time wasting and sent direct to the customer and most times get paid straight away. fabulous!
expenses. how do add an expense thats on a 30 or 60 day account?
. still in trial, but so far so good... very pleased with overall functionality! trial over, five years later... upgraded to 5 stars. perfect app for my small business. does what i need, always available, improves the client experience.
great for my business. this app has been an absolute vital part in helping me run my business. i love it!
new ios too many bugs. cannot open customer invoices. please correct asap!
. i've been using this for my business for 5 years. i love it because i csn do it on my phone through the app and desktop! it is also easy to collect and sibmitt all my tax info at tax time. works for me, easy to learn, and reliable.
. great app
statements. as a mobile business i’m not able to send statements from my iphone 7s when i’m traveling on the road and working out of town, this is the inconvenience we have with quickbooks, i wish you could fix that.
. awesome app for my business!
the best way to manage business. i love it and i can control how i ran the business easy and fast way to keep track of my expenses and income
not good. app and site are actually kind of bad. slow to load. not enough options. will try xero soon
never worked. downloaded app but it has consistently failed to open. only the message 'unfortunately quickbooks online has stopped'. tried all the suggested work rounds, uninstall, clear data, clear cache. called help centre and their agent couldn't have been any more disinterested. appalling customer service. not worth subscribing. dreadful service.
great way to get my money in and estimates out.. really happy quickbooks enables me to work anywhere creating on the spot estimates and invoices making my cash flow work better for me. great app
. since a few updates ago when fingerprint sign in was introduced, i've had problems with mileage logging never logs it properly and data is never saved 😡
great app. could do with a little bit more graphic approach, but very effective.
cool app. very convenient, i'm yet to use it to its fullest, but i love the way it alerts me to payments i need to make or should have received. very happy.
. easy to use. very convenient great app
app has gone downhill since update. youve just done an update and hardly anything works. buttons are unresponsive and crashes! sort it out
. awesome app use it everyday on the go.
you need to purchase one per company. if you own multiple companies this software may not work for you. unless you rather pay double and in my case triple for each software per company. highly disappointed and no one that would solve it. regretfully invested.
. nice to use on the go, however does not always organize invoices in order of customer despite having it on that setting
. great app, makes my life much easier!!
quick books makes my life easier!. doing estimates and sending invoices is easier then ever!
. 1 star : i have been inundated with advertisements are so much i went ahead and download it it just so that i could give it a review. hopefully they will not continue to bug me with youtube videos and all these unimportant advertisements i didn't ask for in the first place.
. very simple and easy to use. great for on the move banking, recieving, and invoicing.
excellent. quickbooks online works great for me and makes my work much easier especially with the phone app
intuit quickbooks. job invoices
. don't fill up your information for free trial it's easy to set up for free trial. they doesn't have options in app for unsubscribe your free trial. you have to reach them every day for unsubscribe your free trial. if you not satisfied from app then start call them before 5days, they will not answer your call till your free trial not get expired. be careful before you sign up.
same as other free app. wave does the same and it's free... once it's finish my period i am out.
great business tool. this program has helped me i the field like no other program i can think of.
. terrible app, customer service is a joke with no follow up. switching to a different accounting software.
new update issues. the previous update solved these issues, but this current update causes error messages with sales rep login whenever creating invoices, and also causes printing communication errors constantly.
zero stars if possible. i login successfully on pc but using same info i get error message saying i don't have an account. if there's no mobile app access, i wish my boss didn't require me to use quickbooks online. the desktop version + go to my pc worked fine.
a changing life app. i’m new to the u.s and this app helps a lot to get organized. just love it.
. have used quickbooks online for many years and i am very happy with how easy it is to use and the email invoices are extremely professional looking.
fantastic features. all the features that works under this single app. i used to work with excel spreadsheet, invoice app, expense app to complete the business on the go. now everything has being simplify into this one subscription saving me time and double entry. i am absolutely happy that i can email invoice, take pictures and enter expense using my iphone. best of all these is update into the cloud. great excellent accounting software nothing comes close after trying others accounting software.
great. great app i use it everyday, makes invoices a breeze and makes it easier at the end of the year for tax purposes.
great app. i've been using qbo for about 6 months and i love it. i own a real estate firm (small scale, 5 agents and below) and quickbooks has saved me a lot of time and helped organize my business.
perfect software for the right companies. i absolutely love it! i have a small freelance design company, so i'm billing for services and commissions. there is nothing i need that it doesn't do and do well. i don't need inventory, estimates or payroll, so this program is about as friendly to me as it could possibly be.
"excellent for my small business. works great on my lg g2. record keeping is considerably less time consuming and easier. love the function of taking a picture of recipts and uploading. sending customers professional looking invoices on the spot from my phone and offering the option to ""pay now"" is awesome! good job!"
. amazing app.
functions missing. works well enough but when receiving payments it doesn't allow you to pick the bank account. frequent problems with it locking up as well
just easy. safe and secure . superb app ..
ios 13 and later app crashes. the app works well prior to ios 13.0 when opened in an iphone running ios 13 later, the app crashes after faceid login.
best app i've used!. i started my small business with quickbooks and i was able todo everything in one application! from sale receipts, expenses, lodging gst and more. i would highly recommend quickbooks to all business owners
. this app is honestly magnificent. it helps me balance my checkbook. helps me track expenses and send invoices. it's honestly a must.
. nice program to help me manage my sales.
. app don't update with bank account need to use desk top
. app works great for day to day accounting. however, the app does not allow for the use of price rules. you can set up price rules in the browser version, but they do not port over to the android app version. we use a tablet on the floor, and cabt use the app, have to login via chrome browser, which is slower than the app.
update killed the app. after this last update i can't save to add payments or invoices. can't even take a credit card. it's killing me.
qbooks online. the windows version is pretty decent but the mobile app is horrible. the invoicing option is not that great. i give it 2 star just because it is accessible from every where.
great app!. this app makes it so much easier to manage your quickbooks online account from the road or the office or anywhere!
qbo quickstart. i find it user friendly, reasonably easy to pick up and the ability to use it on my phone, ipad or pc is very useful.
needs a lot of work. very disappointing they removed card payment facility, only reason i went with quickbooks over xero. also don't try and do anything within app or your accounts will get into a right mess (things like match a payment or transfer) you will end up with duplicate transactions that can only be deleted by logging into web client. upsetting the company that all those years ago changed the industry (and took on sage) have failed so badly.
. best app out there for assisting in every phase of running your company
. this has made it so much easier to keep track of our business expenses. i have recommended qbo to all my friends who own there own business.
waste of valuable time.. all i wanted was a simple app to send 1 (one) out of state customer an invoice at the end of the month. my other 2 (two) customers don't really need one. took an hour to set it up and a couple more to figure out i was declined. just wanted something simple.
best business app. i never write reviews but had to for quickbooks. absolutely love. couldn't run my business without it. have recommend it to everyone.
easy. seems to do everything i need it to.
easy to use and great for tracking transactions. navigation is straightforward and the software updates quickly
recommended. fantastic app, very handy and easy to use
. i'm hooked love to send estimates and invoices on the fly.
. great business app
quality product. i've just taken over the accounts for the business with little experience and knowledge and i have found quickbooks online very easy to use. issuing invoices and running payroll is quick and simple. the support is extremely good too from professionals who know what they are doing not just anybody in a call centre reading a script.
waiting for updates. quite frankly, it's been totally useless. the app does not sync new data entries with the online database. i've already spent well over three hours with multiple customer support reps. the idea of creating invoices is great....only problem....it does not work!!!
#1. the only business app i'll ever need...thank you!
wow superb app. it is so well designed
freedom. great piece of software as i'm able to invoice customers right from a tablet and be on my way!! well done!
app crashes. this app crashes or cannot save my data on every entry i make. horrible app!!
new to quickbooks. i decided to switch my established business from square to quickbooks and so far i have no complaints. it’s fairly easy to use. the only thing i’m currently waiting on is for my transactions to clear and be deposited which takes about a week since i’m new. should be a breeze after that.
crash books pro. this terrific app asks you every few minutes to rate their program knowing that you want to tell the world how you can't send out an invoice without the app crashing. *update* i am having more issues with the app then ever. i can only assume quickbooks is either more useless then i thought. or they are retaliating for my review of their product. i have never had any program work this bad and i have worked it.
. good customer care.
app glitch. other than the recent app glitch all is good.
me. quite useful for quick insight of status of company's books.
self employment. great app
. constantly updating features great app! they keep adding features that makes it easier to use.
saves me 250month on payroll.. i can now run my corporation from my tablet, without an accountant. invoice on job site while on the clock instead of for free at home away from kids. also it’s 250 bucks a month cheaper for qb to do my payroll compared to my accountant to do quarterly sales tax reporting and weekly payroll for 1 5 employees...
not suitable. i was hoping to be able to manage qb from my ipad as if i had access to my qbo accountant tools. sadly not. back to the laptop to actually get my work done.
love it. huge time saver to photo and input expenses. i can't imagine my life without it.
makes life easier. does everything i need! only 1 suggest...i want to sort quotes by date created...
. sucks...
no sign in recognition. i have been using the online version on my pc for a while. the mobile app will not let me sign in no matter what i do.
useful but slow. quickbooks online in general is useful for sending out invoices and estimates on the go, going through expenses, etc... however the platform can be fairly slow and sometimes glitchy.
awesome. very good app
nothing but glitches on my ipad. really not worth it nothing but problems one operating on ipad
update needed asap. i also have been using this app for years (it’s great when working properly) but something happened after this last update and i’m getting kicked off and signed out in the middle of my invoices and estimates. it’s staying “an important update is required” or something like that and i’ll go to update the app but it’s already updated! and i’ll log back into the app and get kicked off again with the same message.....
great tool. its great tool for small business. makes my life easier. recommend to everyone
terrible to customers. your website deleted my account, which i spent hours putting together, and had every intention of subscribing and paying for this service, and then when i spoke with customer service to see what happened, i was told to call two other numbers for the same service, then placed on hold by the final number for 510 minutes, and was hung up on. they had my number and never called me back. horrible service to your customers. i will pursue a different company.
great. great app does everything it says it will
not good after update. used to send invoices via email through my phone android before update cannot anymore. called customer service told me to uninstall and reinstall still same problem.. had to buy an ipad in able to send invoices :( horrible!
quickbooks online. there are a few little glitches between phone tablet and desktop but all in all it's a great program saves time works really well for customers send an email to confirm payment is nice adding a customer in your phone does not work but as long as i use the administrator adding names as i go it works well in the field
awesome software. i'm a creative and figures aren't my thing, and i find it a dream to use. i'm so glad my accountant recommended it. having your accounts in the cloud just makes the whole laborious process a snip!
best invoice app available. so far the best, has everything you need and more, it's like everything you pay for what you get.
. i am using quick books since a weak very happy with it as of now the help line is also quite good they will help me to solve my query or doubts then and there problems faced so far is there is no sms options and sometimes waiting time for my turn in the helpline
. love this app
. it's an ok app, tends to crash here and there.
q books. i love this app it's very useful
. love the app. as a quickbooks proadvisor the app help me keep up with clients while on the go..
does everything i need.. if i could see my outstanding bills on the dashboard, i would say it was perfect. but even though qb have chosen not to include this requested feature, i am still happy to recommend.
keeps crashing. every time i try to upload a receipt from my phone, it crashes when i press save & doesn’t save at all. i’ve tried closing the app & trying again, but it does it every time, so basically i can’t take a picture of any receipt & upload it. please fix! update: i still can’t upload a receipt unless i take a picture of it elsewhere & upload vs taking a picture of it on the app.
. quickbooks is an easy way to estimate invoice and send them to customers i enjoy this app very much
good when i'm away from my cpu. i didn't expect a full service app. but it's still a great app when i need to get something done on the fly.
appréciation. vraiment bien pensée, facile d'utilisation et efficace ! thoughtful application, easy to use and useful !
. i have this quick books and pay outrageous monthly for the worst service specially the mobile app. have called them so many times but all they care about is to collect. just waste of time and no help. i wish i could take my customer list and go to another co. does anyone know any co. better?
good value for money. happy with the program and functionality across varied devices
. great app, much easier to invoice customers.
. love the program, but still new to it, and ned to learn more about it.
. great app!
keep on improving!. hope that when using finger print to log in the crashes will subside. in addition looking forward to the mobil versions looking and acting more like the desktop. don't get me wrong... i do feel that there has been substantial progress but i'm looking forward to not having to drag my lap top.
. app freezes and crashes several times a day. the photo receipt scan feature is probably the biggest culprit. even simple things like updating my business contact information yields an error message which is usually followed by a crash. the mac version of qbo isn't any better. similar issues there. very clunky, buggy applications. too much time spent troubleshooting. time for an alternative.
. like it but doesn't seem like it syncs with my phone app.
good so far. i'm new to this app. seems to work good so far. if it changes or if i can suggest something i will when i know more.
. since the update can't add trips for mileage. app was working perfectly before the update. app won't allow addresses to be added like before. why not just leave well enough alone?
everything i hoped & more. we switched to quickbooks with the hope of having a quicker, easier and more efficient way to keep our books. it is everything we hoped for and more. i love ability to go paperless on delivery tickets, signatures and po's. all of which can be done paperless. greg nees, owner cisco tool, inc.
great app!. ah
. why can't i see bank account details in the app? you can on the ios app contacted help desk who couldn't help! without access to accounts the app is effectively useless.
. not bad. there is a bug when trying to display the contents of an invoice. when that is fixed, i will give it 5 stars. update  the bug seems to be fixed.
. i initially had some issues with quickbooks, but they've since improved quite a bit. i love it! it's the most efficient way for me to send invoices and collect payments.
statement from app ?. works great for me but i wish you were able to print off a statement from the app.
good but.... very useful, but needs flexibility for budgeting and more reports. i do most of my work on my ipad so it falls short of desktop online version.
". downloaded the app to be able to view estimates and invoices from phone while i'm away from my computer and someone calls wanting to know ""how much did we have in this job or that job"" well, the app is prettt useless when you have hundreds of estimates out and you're trying to find a particular one , but there is no ""search"" tool to look for what you're trying to find."
". the fingerprint authentication doesn't work. says ""error returned from client"" when i try to enable it. others mentioned screenshots don't work. i know there is a workaround, but that requires you to permit it every time you want to use it because it limits you to 15 minutes. there are no reports available on here which is most important to me."
. excellant app helped taking the stress out of book keeping
changed my life. very helpful and easy to use. now i am my own accountant and i can keep close track on everything i do. i love this app!
great app. helps me stay on top of my business while away from the office and quickly send and receive invoices. love this app!
just started with it.. can i attach a file to an invoice that i create with the app? i don’t see the option and we need to be able to do this or this appprogram won’t work for us.
crashes. app crashes every time i'm using a lg g5 emailed support for help 3 weeks ago no response.sent response never heard back.
. crashes every time. hasn't opened successfully once. tried reinstalling and restarting tablet.
. this app sucks! i can't even login
contractor. love this app
. this update is very bad. activities don't come up anymore. have to navigate to long to find stuff... i don't need to see company details first. i need to see customer activities.... this is such a waste of time and very frustrating. now i have to search for a new program. the app on a mobile device doesn't even open. it says sync problem. it's been days since i logged into the app. always problems with this company. the app is terrible.....
. these days, i'm having trouble attaching my pdf scans of receipts to my expenses. i keep getting the error message that says that it can't be processed right now and i have to contact 1800... for assistance. please do something about it! it's getting really frustrating.
mileage tracker not working.. so far quickbooks support has not been able to get the mileage tracking feature to work on my phone. iphone6. won’t manually of automatically track mileage and wb support has not resolved or explained why. partial functionality is not good enough!
i also should have read the reviews. i only use my quickbooks to track expenses and deposits due to the nature of my business. i have been trying to use the mobile version of this program now, after being on the pc version for over 10 years, and still cannot find a way to log my deposits. i can accept payments for invoices, which i do not use for the majority of my business but cannot enter a straight deposit.
. this software is superb for business owners but need some customization in product and services option they should provide stock quantities in app and also purchase invoice with itemised discounts option should provided in app
awesome ap for a handyman. emailing my client the invoice or receipt is effecient and impressive. being able to enter expenses when they occur saves me office time. only fall back is i cant yet enter store charges.
. super duper app
. emailed 3 times now would be nice to get a reply as would like a refund due to canceling my subscription in the first 30day free trial but have still been charged for it.
. great app for mobile business owners such as myself.
mileage is a joke. i upgraded to this account from the self employed version and the mileage is a joke. i thought the self employed was horrible. it completely missed a whole day of travel and cut’s off trips in the middle of traveling. or cuts the trips starting and ending if it even records the visit.
great. always easy and concise. great to do my invoices on the road!!
completely useless. i have no idea how this app has a 4.7. you cant even edit transactions within this app. the worst part is that the website is completely broken on an ipad pro. together this makes quick books online completely unusable without a laptop. absolute garbage.
. makes up time, and easier to keep up with.
reports. would be nice if app could run reports. hopefully more robust in the future.
"latest upgrade is a disgrace. i have never written a negative review of an upgrade, but the latest version of this app made a great app totally useless. you can no longer receive invoices or reconcile bank balances. do yourself a favor and delete the quickbooks app rather than ""upgrade."" the mobile website is more useful than the app."
so amazing!!!!!. this has made my life so easy with estimates and invoicing.
when it works it’s great. this app will not recognize my credentials even as i use the online version. i wish it were reliable and i was able to use it consistently. even reinstalling the app does not fix the problem. intuit needs to focus on making this app work on a regular basis as you pay for this service.
. great app
does not work. cannot trust any invoices under clients or vendorsall are bad. only thing it can be used for is to take a photo of a receipt and add it to a vendors account. can make up an estimate in the field otherwise it is terrible
. more user friendly and flexible than sage
. a lot to learn but works well.
thanks intuit. i can create invoices at the job and get paid on the spot. ..no problems so far.
gr8 system. for some one that's all thumbs and prehistoric to technology i found quickbooks not only easy and user friendly, but its approach to my business is so easy to follow, it's almost transparent.... heaps better than myob. and i speak from experience......
email is my only complaint i don't like my emails coming from into it i want to choose my own email so my customers can respond please fix this. respond it's when i'm sending invoices or estimates
. i love this app i love this app even more now because i'm able to bill my customers almost as soon as i am done the work.
needs better support. i thought this was a great app then it wouldn’t allow expenses to be uploaded, one of the main reasons for using this on the mobile app, support we’re worse than useless and could give no time scale as to when this would be fixed to a small business working on the go this defeated the whole point of using a mobile app, am looking for alternatives
buyer beware crash instantly on iphone 6. this app works sometimes but it will instantly crash and doesn't operate properly on my iphone 6 running the latest iphone software. i tried removing and reinstalling but it still doesn't work properly. why don't you guys fix this? also, it annoyingly downloads company info every time you open it which takes what seems like hours. i have a very small landscape business. should this be the case? come on intuit! get your act together
time saver!. this app has decreased the amount of time i used to spend in the office by 75%! it's intuitive and the support is fantastic. a great investment for my small business. invoicing and quoting should never be a burden.
subpressions. like the mobile app
the best business app ever!. i have been in business for nine years and have been using quickbooks desktop. i am now using the online and it is great so happy that i made the switch. works well with ipad and can do my work right on the site! thanks for the great work! ray's home improvement,llc
many bugs. need to fix bugs that cause the app to not follow the regular online access. employees can see things they shouldn't (like business income) and are unable to do things they should like entering customer info and invoices.
amazing app for business .. i run my construction business with this app and just got the card reader now
. wonderful excellent program. does wonderful for my small business
retired. this new online version is the best so far. user friendly, everything you want to know is right in front of you when you sign in. easy to navigate
app crashing multiple devices (ios 10 & ios 11). i use this app for my business and after the last update the app has been completely useless on my ipad and on my phone. the only way i can log data is by sitting at my computer when i get home from work. please fix asap. using freshbooks until then. thanks.
getting there.... the lack of ability to create bank deposits is vexing. also, would be nice to work with downloaded transactions. works with mint, why not qbo app?
. works all fine and easy to use. pro tip: if anything breaks, delete your local cache and try again 😊 (thanks to the qb support)
frank. this app is amazing. it is exactly what i needed to start my business. it makes it quick and easy to do your estimates, invoices, and keep track of all your accounting needs.
editing invoices on the go!. i love it! when life is such a bustle and you need to create an estimate or invoice for customers, quickbooks makes it easy to do.
crashes when downloading. crashes when downloading after initial setup. have not been able to use app. disappointing.
. this was almost my solution to doing invoices on the road. unfortunately, they do not allow pdf attachments when sending an email. i need to send a pdf not jpegs so until this option is added this app is useless for me.
. just started using this app and so far i really like it.
awesome!. this is app is like a holy grail! ‼️🙌🏾 it works really well with my iphone too💙💙
new version. the updates are great.
excellent. quickbooks online works great for me and makes my work much easier especially with the phone app
no refund and help support was clueless.. called twice no one could help me and both phone numbers proved useless. billing support was not helpful. could not even locate my ipad online subscription thru itunes. waste of time and money in my experience.
happy customer. best small business software ever. qbs has made my life so much better and my books are much more accurate🤗. thank you for a user friendly accounting service.
app is satisfactory  quickbooks online is not. i am very unhappy with quickbooks online. if you are anything more then a landlord of one rental property, then you will find quickbooks online to be greatly underwhelming. it is clunky, glitchy, and virtually void of any mechanism for customizing the program. it is not a replacement for quickbooks desktop. perhaps after a few years of unfortunate beta testers abandoning quickbooks online it will get better. for now, though, don't do it.
. so easy to use! i wish i had started to use this when i set up my business! it saves me so much time and i can enter transactions from my tablet which is so convenient. i also love the way it links (safely) to my bank account and automatically brings all my transactions into quickbooks. would strongly recommend!
seems good so far!. i just downloaded the app, however for what i use qb for, this app is perfect and will definitely make my time more efficient. i am always on the go and handwrite all checks. from what i can see, you can quickly enter checks written (and even take a picture) and also manage your online banking. which is perfect for my needs.
not working with ios13.0. not able to click on customers, create new estimates or invoices. tried reinstalling. still no luck.
great app. just started to use. easy to navigate. have had no issues.
the convenience of this service is worth every penny. without this app, i would often forget to log in after a job and record my time on an invoice. now, i can record billable time, field notes and expenses as i perform them, and email the bill to my customer upon my departure. the only thing i would like to see added is a way to record mileage as miles.
does not work. i have just spotted an ad on the bus in london. installd the app. created an account. it was difficult to activate my account as the app does not read sms itself. all in all, after logon the carches  it is not unable at all. i use galaxy s6.
unreliable.. great when it works right; frustrating when it doesn't. older data from desktop version seems to be corrupted in mobile version. when it becomes stable and reliable, it will be nice asset. at the moment, however, it's annoying too frequently.
great. easy to take a payment while out at work. and they are all ways updating and improving. very good. highly recommended
. simple and easy to use app. makes life easier for small business owners.
. haven't dug deep into the options available, but thus far my experience has been very good.
quickbooks. really hard to get online started i'll write another review when i get it started
not work in india.. i have installed it, but when i open it. it show that it is not work in india. i have hear abt this app, that it is very good in it field but what if it not work in my country.
spam generator. don't get involved with intuit. they're stalkers. whatever utility the app has is outweighed by the spam
app no longer works. everything was good with it for about 6 months now the app no longer allows me to log in saying there has been a security problem. other devices work told by quickbooks support it was being looked into 2 months ago and still nothing. very disappointed that i'm paying for this to not work
simplifies. this app makes it really easy and fast to manage receipts and expenses.
love this app tho. 😘👌👍👏😊♡✔
sooo easy. i love quickbooks. has made my life so much easier
good but. it would be great if you could take a photo of a receipt instead of having to scan and save to a location on the phone
. great app! makes running my business so much easier
. invoicing only works when it feels like. app is very hard to navigate. half the tools i have to log in to my computer and do on the desktop version. very dissatisfied and will be cancelling this service soon as i find a better alternative.
user friendly. come from using myob. quickbooks is easy to use, calculates gst, bas and invoices. highly recommend.
vijay. very nice app
business on the run. quickbooks online with the ios app make operating a travel based business on the run simple. log invoices as you go. input estimates along the way. print and mail or email all at once at the end of the day. not to mention the helpful reports and expense management. i couldn't run my business without it.
. so slow to picture receipts and save as a note!!! just scanning 6 invoices took about 20 minutes. nightmare.
. won't send invoices to customers, complete waste of time and money would not recommend to anybody.
love it!. quick books merging your gmail contacts and being able to add and subtract expenses lays your invoices out really well and makes everything so easy! clients get all the information this way and it leaves them without surprises. because of the convenience it forces me and reminds me to enter all the information that i would otherwise forget to include.
. great app & software on the go.
help and advise. i subscribe this on the trial and pop up the good deal 7.49 for 3 months and should be starting my payment for real is 14.99 in january. hey should be responsible for this ads. apple
great way to run a business. the way razorsync and quickbooks works together makes it possible for me to have a life after work! there are a few more things that would make life easier but overall a big thumbs up!
easy to use from mobile phone.. i can do everything electronically from mobile device.
update google signin never works. update: quickbooks support contacted me. i uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it works now.  i have tried and tried to get into the quickbooks app using the google signin. i get it to work maybe 1 out of every 50 times i try to login. i don't know why they haven't fixed this issue yet. i always end up logging in on my mobile browser instead. fail
. made my job very easier. thanks
. app worked good for the first couple of months but now hasn't work for a few days straight on my samsung phone. emailed the report to them but have received no reply.
horrible. this app and their customer service is terrible.
awesome app. as a small business owner i'm constantly on the go. this app is amazing. with very little effort i can quickly add a new client create an invoice and get paid how i want.
productivity. love all the intuit products. helps run my business professionally. been able to do my own scorp taxes and payroll for a couple years now. saving me thousands over a cpa and payroll company like in previous years. business owner now for 26 years
. works great and simple to use
not to happy. to many glitches
why use the app when you it lacks the features of the website. you can’t change the status of in invoice on the app and must be done online only. this is a major flaw in the app. once i do my taxes i will no longer be using quick books, because of the enforced complexity the system is rendered mostly useless. the app needs to have complete functionality of the site.
". getting this message last 3 days. ""there was a problem syncing your data. wait a few minutes and try again"". please fix this"
app crashes constantly. i used to love this app. the last couple of months the app crashes daily and multiple times. i’m in the middle of working and the app says critical updates are needed and logs me out. i’m extremely frustrated with this considering i pay over $20month to use this software across all my devices.
powerful, concise and easy to use. i get the information i need immediate, and am able to review, edit and accept transactions quickly and easily. this helps me answer questions on the fly!!
can't bring myself to use it.. it's nowhere near as useful as the desktop app. i'd love to be able to create an invoice on my phone or tablet and upload photos right from the device. can't do it yet.
. thanks for making our financial records tracking make easier. software is amazing. suggestion: please add purchase order in mobile app.
app keeps crashing. keeps saying the session is over when i sign in and logs me out
no multiple account support?. would like to give it a better rating but without multiple account functionality it's value for me is limited. otherwise good functionality.
. good app, has some minor flaws but does work in a pinch when your out on the road and need to do a quick invoice
app does not work. i have been unable to see my profits and loss on the app for months now and often the app does not let me log in. i get constant errors. i have spent hours with tech support on the phone all they say is “it’s a known bug”. they have not been able to tell me for months when will the app work again.
. fast and convenient for recording transactions.
changed my world in a good way!. simple, intuitive, any device, anywhere. let's me do my accounting on the fly instead of working though a pile of admin at the end of the month.
don’t waste your time. the developer is very slow to fix bugs and non responsive when a complaint or ticket is generated. the tax rates are a total mess in the app. there is very little control over adding new or editing existing rates generated by qb while using the online version. any time i use an apple product i have the same issue.
. they said in your invoice that you can cancel anytime and it's not true! it has a glitch and i couldn't cancel it. make me lost two days trying to cancel it and then even charge me the month and did not give back my money. they went from 17 dollars a month to 40 dollars per month! don't never quickbooks
. love the app! it makes my job so much easier!
recent update. crashes frequently! if editing an estimate or invoice on ipad it opens in a floating window that can slide down into the abyss and all progress is lost! very unhappy with the latest update!
ok but.... qb is ok. major flaw however when trying to look at a customer's order history. the list of invoices does not show the memo so you can tell what item the invoice is for. this is a serious problem.
. lovely app.
got worse after the update. it shows the information of last week, it doesn't update
awesome. streamlines my entire business, saves me tons of time, lets me take credit cards, and best of allows me to bill on the spot.
don’t update. ever since last update it crashes when i try to run a credit card. was talking with customer support for an hour and all she could say is i understand. when i asked to speak to a manager the line was disconnected
useful app for sure. thanks for the refresh feature, will definitely make my job easier. 5 stars.
. ok app. automatic data refresh would be great
. excellent app can do more on the app on android then on the iphone. works great!!
. works very well for how i use the app within my business.
. words cannot express how unfriendly this platform and interface is. both on app and desktop. nothing is plain and simple, switching back to invoice2go as i've been trying to create an estimate for over 6 hrs here and it takes me 5 mins on invoice2go
hate the app. limited functionality of the app makes it virtually useless... unless i have access to a pic or laptop, i can't do all the things i need to do. the program itself is good, just not sure why the app hasn't caught up yet.
no place for attachments. when i first opened the app i was so excited. i have been a quick book user for years and now everything is available at a touch from my ipad. but the only thing that was missing was a place to put attachments from the banking screen. so bummed hope this gets an update with the attachment feature.
. the desktop app is great, the mobile android one is bad, it freezes all thr time, crashes, doesn't work.
. my experience with qb has been great. its fast easy to operate .
qb app. not useful as it could be as you can't enter a bill! not being able to enter a bill makes it useless to work from an ipad or tablet device.
can’t upload receipts. it’s incredibly ridiculous that you can’t upload receipts from anywhere but your photos app. what if you get emailed an invoice? nope can’t upload it!
great app. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😊😊
what a joke. i am not a software developer and who ever designed this joke is not one either
. love the software, the app is very functional and easy to use.
. great program. easy to use. payments made in the field, no more waiting for money. 2 thumbs up
coffee machine doctor. this is the safest and fastest accounting system ever just like a shot of espresso
great app but needs improvement. there are various things you can’t do on app .example you can’t set recurring transaction, use batch actions for reminders. for indian users , they have not launched quickbooks payment. there is no customer portal ,there should be system for sending invoice and reminder link via sms overall it is good app and all does the basic stuff but should look forward to integrate above stuff as well
doesnt seem to work on lg g4. cant even log in to the app.raised it with quickbooks support over a month and we still cant seem to get it working
mario osorio painting and a&t housecleaning. love this program very friendly and very easy to understand for my self and my bookkeeper.
hong leong connect first. i don’t get to link to my leong connect first account. please fix this so that i use it right away. my sister told me this app is superb.
. awesome. very easy to navigate. amazing to be able to do all this from my phone.
. i though it would be difficult. once it's set up, it's a breeze. the importing of bank transactions really makes things easier.
amazing. east, fast and quick to learn. highly recommended
better than xero. brilliant app. seamless to use. all of my clients now use it!
great way to run a business. the way razorsync and quickbooks works together makes it possible for me to have a life after work! there are a few more things that would make life easier but overall a big thumbs up! one more star for a stronger search engine, can't find invoices by number or customers by address
still unresolved issues 3 month later. i’ve had quickbooks for over 3 month now and since i’ve had it i have been unable to allocate my bank transactions on my app. i’ve flagged this to quickbooks and had responses but no fix. keep being told to use desktop version for now! 3 months and still not fixed isn’t good enough for a payed for app.
". checked this app out to see if it was good for my business. i was charged 7.99 for a ""free"" 30 day trial. decided it wasnt the right app for me. thanks for the 2 days i used it and was charged for. awesome!! (insert sarcasim here)"
. this app works well in ios, but a total disaster on android. i was supposed to renew my subscription, but instead, it routed me to creating a new company under a new subscription. i wasted my money for something i do not need. do not download this app.
. excellent app. crazy versatile. love that they supply a basic reader free of charge. lots of ways to accept payment. input expenses so you can write them off for taxes. nice. stoked to use it.
crashes every time i try to open anything.. i hate this app.
qbo app. luv the new dashboard!! excellent app. no complaints.
. does exactly what i need on the go.
. love that i can send invoices from my phone!
perfect software for the right companies. i absolutely love it! i have a small freelance design company, so i'm billing for services and commissions. there is nothing i need that it doesn't do and do well. i don't need inventory, estimates or payroll, so this program is about as friendly to me as it could possibly be.
convenient & helpful. as a new business owner and usually overwhelmed with just running the business, the app and website make the financial and tax side of the business easy to stay current and accurate. once i got the initial tax required and payroll payments set up, it's made my life easier.
kiss. keep it simple stupid as they say, this app is brilliant, simple, easy to use a great for a small business that just wants everything in one app at their fingertips. well done team.
. great accounting app
loving it!. very simple and user friendly.
errors. why you never check your app before you launch it online so many errors no touch id when signing no latest activities update receive payment not working and this just 5 min of use
best app. love this app makes it easy for me to track all my buisness transactions. recommend
very useful. just as fluid as the full version on my pc. easy to use, and can generate invoices quickly..
. not bad. there is a bug when trying to display the contents of an invoice. when that is fixed, i will give it 5 stars. update  the bug seems to be fixed.
. very slow. app doesnt update automatically. i have to manually update which takes forever for a relatively small number of changes to be downloaded. quite disappointed with it.
worthless app. i was excited to find this app and, unfortunately, downloaded it. i really cannot figure out what is good for other than creating invoices. confusing when you open the app, it does not get better as you get into it, not that there is anything to get into. i run a small non profit & just found this app useless, except for taking up space. what a pity as i have been a qb user for years.
. great app. i love it
terrible. glitchy. doesn't update new transactions. hard to navigate compared to desktop qbo app. honestly, intuit knows it can do better than this. they're just greedy.
functional with problems. the latest update took away the ability to choose territory in the app even though using a web browser does. i contacted intuit to report the problem. very nice but nothing has been done to fix it. also, common reports aren't available in the app.
can't match bank transactions reliably. the only reason i use this app is to match bank transactions when i have some 'down' minutes. lately, they keep getting kicked back to me, so i have to match them on my pc anyway. also, you don't have access to both memo and description, so your notes don't appear in reports if you add the transaction though a bank connection.
. haven't been able to access my books since early september, can only use desktop app, browser and mobile app gives error message. contacted support 4+, engineers are working on known problem...10 weeks and counting
. this app has one major flaw in my view. my bank transactions do not update unless i go through the website and update it there. this is probably the only reason i have this app. this is very annoying and i have contacted quickbooks about this issue and they are not helpful. they tell me to go to the website and update it there! would be a great app if they fix this issue.
love it. best app ever
. great app
quick books app. it works as good as my computers program! i can do the work i need to right from my phone!
. we have been using for a couple years now and are very satisfied with the flexibility and reliability of the program. the integration with tsheets is real time saver. highly recommend
awesome app. i really like this app, i can track all my incomes and expenses, it shows my net profit and everything else i could possibly need. i really enjoy using this app.
great app really does work for my business. really easy to do my accounts and invoices.
really useless without bank register. the usefulness is really limited without having access to banking features via mobile app. dissappointed.
. pc or macbook apps are good but i am sorry to say that this app is waste of time. very slow. page loading time is more that 1 min even with wifi having 100mb broadband speed.
. great app and easy to use!
poor. the program is slow and it is hard to find what you want. does not compare to their desktop version.
. baixeii e testei na esperança que tivesse as mesmas funcionalidades do microsoft money, que so existe para pc mas, não tem, fica muito aquém.
lacking features. when receiving a payment or creating a receipt, i'd like to be able to take a photo of the check or any other attachment i want. i'd also like to be able to choose the class and what account it's going into. these are all things i can do through the web browser.
very good for any kind of business!. quickbooks is great app for managing the everyday finances. it's very fast to send invoices, with this app all income and expenses are simple and quick.
works well but can’t see inventory level in app. would be helpful if i could check inventory levels without going to web, other than that pretty handy app
. it would be good to be able to save pdf receipts downloaded to my mobile straight onto the app. all i can do just now is take a screenshot.
. i can see my subscription for months. click to manage subscription and i am told i have none. haven't used thus app but have been paying for months. help
has some 🐜. i really like qbs. sometimes i cannot send invoices or edit. a message pops up saying that ‘try again later’. i would like to use my own design for my invoices instead of the very simple format i can only use in their system.
crashes every time. i used to like this app, but now it crashes every time. i cannot use it at all. galaxy s7 edge. support has not responded to my messages. nor my crash message notifications (and there have been plenty)
good and useful. chamuka
"latest upgrade is a disgrace. i have never written a negative review of an upgrade, but the latest version of this app made a great app totally useless. you can no longer receive invoices or reconcile bank balances. do yourself a favor and delete the quickbooks app rather than ""upgrade."" the mobile website is more useful than the app."
. downloaded and reinstalled current version and still could not login to my account. quite frustrating coming from intuiit!
after ios 13 update. after updating to ios 13 the app is not opening and i couldn’t use it.... please look into it and give us a solution
doesn't work. app crashes on load and while logging in. pretty useless so far. :(
. fantastic app! so easy to use and send invoices in seconds. love it!
". update 101619: still useless as constant login issues persist, why use the app if i constantly have to uninstallreinstall + clear cachedata. constantly unable to use app  login, keep getting ""temporarily unavailable"" !!!"
. for an app qbo is awesome. it does not have all the features of a desktop program but what app does? you guys are doing an incredible job and making impovements to both program and app all the time.
great. great software.
please add a “transfer” option on app. overall good app but would like to have a transfer option on the mobile app i find myself having to login to the desktop version just to transfer amounts between my accounts. also, someone please find a way to mark estimates as “readseen” by the customer just like the invoices do. ipad version needs help; jumps around too much
great app. so easy to use.
good, not great.. quickbooks online can do everything i need it to do. but i have trouble getting invoices, quotes and expenses saved to the cloud. it's annoying and aggravating to be waiting for things to upload. if the cloud sync thing worked seamlessly, then it's a 55 for sure.
. gd apps
easy. i don't like accounting whatsoever however quickbooks online is so easy to use and does so much more than keeping the books up to date.
no customer service. i like the application and the features which can be improved of course, but i can't give them more then two star. is more than one week and no technical support. i can't buy this application without support.
great app. i personally find the app easier then the desktop version. everything is quick and easy to do. raise an invoice or estimate instantly and see your bank account balance. great.
. the online version of quickbooks works well, but the app is terrible. we are in 2018 and the apps still can't do anything useful. why can't we have the same functions and features as the online version. i want to be able to view all my reports at any time. easily key in transactions. the app needs some serious work. no joke.
. great app. really good for when you are on the road.
keep crush !. my iphone version is ios11.2.1. i can’t open this app. keep crushing. please fix asap.
very good app. if i could link my icall to it, it would be perfect 5 stars
. this app is only a trial version... i downloaded it because i thought it'd be free. talk about click bait!!! smh
. it makes life so much easier and its eady to learn and gain knowledge and experience
awesome. amazingly quick and efficient. very easy to learn how to use.
work in progress, work not yet completed. very convenient and functional tomorrow to add expenses and receipts on the go. however only expenses not bills or other random transactions can be accessed through the mobile app. hoping intuit sees the feedback and that all transactions available including bills to be accessed on the mobile app.
so useful.... i don't really use it like it's designed. i have 50 company trucks & 5 semi trucks to keep track of at our repair shop. this allows me to document everything. each vehicle as a customer with year & type always easy to find. each invoice acts as a repair, allows me to document every detail and track costs. luv this app! well worth the subscription fee.
great for small business. i run a small business mostly through through etsy. this is a great program to keep track of finances. the only thing i wish is it would integrate paypal here payments like it does square. it would be amazing if it could do the same with etsy. alas, i have to type them in by hand. i love the integrate on my iphone, ipad and macbook. it is very streamlined.
check payment image. i wish if i can take of the customer check payment image and with in it on the app. both of them times it’s hard to search for invoice number and when customers overpay the system does not stop them and the refund process is so difficult.
great app. loving it  i love keeping track of expenses on the go and how it syncs with quickbooks online.
exactly what i need. the app combined with the online system does exactly what i need it to do. i can invoice clients as soon as i've left their premises, no more trying to keep a record and doing the paperwork later. invoice matching and bank data feeds make reconciliation so easy. this has reduced the amount of time i spend on my accounts significantly. goodbye sage, hello qb online. happy customer.
great app. the best invoice maker i ever had! great services
great app  not all features. great app. need to be able to cut purchase orders while on the road . . . not there yet.
. this app works amazing for my cleaning business! couldnt live without it, and it saves me a lot of money instead of paying an accountant
very happy. i love this app for my business
desktop to online user. qb desktop user who switched to qbo. really like the ability to use on all my computers and ios devices. just wish it would have easier reports to make and use. no time sheets feature in ios, tsheets by quickbooks fills that void.
. am trying to login, wont let me, technical problems. i have all my expenses in there...
. has made my life much much easier please include income list
handy app for small businesses. *****
. downloaded app twice when i tried to login error message continually read i didn't have a quickbooks subscription. was never allowed to access app features.
needs work. this won't stay up to date with online or desktop app and i regularly get error messages. this is frustrating and useless.
. ok that yiu charge a monthly fee but not ok to charge more than $2 for every payment deposit. will not be using this app for payment anymore. ridiculous!
. great program to use. super simple to learn. has everything you need to run a small business.
subscription portal broken. infuriating support staff that don't have a clue. actually tried to make me pay a second subscription to access my data.
finest accounting software. we are using since last two years and still satisfied.
. great app for managing my business on the go  easy to use!
it is very easy to use. the app may not have the power or flexibility of the web client, or pc installed application, but it works well and is very easy to use.
awesome app!. best way to keep your finances organized!
great but.... very great app. i rated three stars because you can’t enter employee time from your mobile device. i know it’s a mobile app but you should be able to enter time . i understand that mobile apps are a little different but this seems like a simple task that should be possible. i send invoices and estimates all the time with the mobile app other than that it’s a great app. will update rating when these features are added
app crashes. ever since update cannot open app. need to fix immediately.
. so far it does exactly what i need. just starting out so i'm sure there's plenty to learn yet
compatibility issue?. no problem installing it on my phone but will not install in my tablet, says it's not comoatible (both v6.0.1 marshmallow). what seems to be the problem? huge disappointment from such a well known company!
it’s ok, but.... it not very useful as field service software. it’s painfully sloooow to use. even on the pc it’s the same. the software crashes when i need to use it or it’s syncing.
phenomenal. quickbooks app on my phone combined with the online system is the best thing to happen to my new small business. i no longer feel like an accountant full time & business owner part time!
. great app! use this to manage my small business finances. everything you need in one place. also accept payment directly through the app! recommend this to every business owner.
. dreadful experience so far. bought qb 16th dec 2019 and cant get a call back from an english speaker to help me with set up despite multiple attempts! why is sales uk based but support isnt? this is 2nd review  1st disappeared!!! so disappointed and very desperate to get started.
lost a key feature!!!😡. update is great except they took away the option when creating a new customer to use a contacts info that's on the device.
. thank you for the update guys 😊 perfect accounting app for my firm
. great app. getting better all the time too
slow, complicated. can't do everything in app, also need the website open. have spent almost a week setting up. terrible. keeps crashing. awful.
packing slip. please add option to print packing slip from the app
. would be a 5 star is the mobile app scanned and allowed multi page receipts and used ocr to recognize amounts categories etc to short data entry
. the image quality of attaching receipts automatically downgrades and makes everything blurry. this renders the receipt image capture completely useless.
there’s just 1 thing... i have been loving the way this program functions. the only thing i continually wish for is that i would be notified when a customer opens an estimate, not just the invoice.
easy to use. i have been using qb for almost 3 years now and have had nothing but good things to say about the service provided. the support has been great anytime i needed it, they were johnny on the spot. i would highly recommend this to any small business that wants to take the stress out of bookkeeping.
great, clean app. although it's yet another expense for your business, it's well worth every cent. more of an investment for us and we use it for four different companies (yes four times the subscription fee). regardless, it will manage your company's finances as they should be. leaving you with less hassle and worries about your accounts and more time to focus on more important entrepreneurial things.
. this app works well in ios, but a total disaster on android. i was supposed to renew my subscription, but instead, it routed me to creating a new company under a new subscription. i wasted my money for something i do not need. do not download this app.
great. helps me track all of my business needs from estimates and invoicing to financing. great app!
love it. customers are paying online. so much easier for my business. great app.
india is not mentioned. sorry to say that but i uninstalled the app in 3mins because india as a nation is not mentioned.
worst update yet. just deleted. crashed. didn’t update banking. five star to one in a flash.
still in need of basic functionality. timesheets are a must have feature for the mobile app.
decent....but needs work. the mobile app is laid out decent and does work well for the most part. biggest problem i have is you cannot access product quantities or make any purchase orders with the mobile app. need to fix that.
. good app
very useful app. very useful app, works like a charm
slow books. can’t accept transactions in banking section. sluggish app, end up using the computer more often.
excellent app. moved from xero to qbo and couldn't be happier
. good app. like the integration with online accessable pc version.
. not sure why i pay $16 a month for this app when it only works 60% of the time. please get the bugs worked out or i will have find another company to run my business with. cant access my account on tablet, cant save invoice or estimate on s8. please fix.
. great app, doesn't crash and still much to learn from it bur its helping keep my business organized
great app!. an awesome compliment to the web version. addition of balance sheet would be beneficial. cheers!
help full app. it really helps my business being organized and has a lot of features
great app. easy to use.. i would like to see full desktop functionality on the mobile app.
was fantastic. everything worked great until the last update now the air print cannot find printer!
why bother?. don't understand why they bothered developing this app? much more functionality available using safari and logging into quickbooks!
. amazing app. handles all my needs as a small contractor business.
don’t update. ever since last update it crashes when i try to run a credit card. was talking with customer support for an hour and all she could say is i understand. when i asked to speak to a manager the line was disconnected
i run my biz from the app!. i use qb constantly to invoice clients and log incoming checks. it's great for following up on past dues & creating invoices on the go.
. can't run payroll from the app.
glitches. app has lots of glitches. try to create an invoice and it was not working. quickbooks has been awesome up to this point. i run my whole business through quickbooks in this new update has been a disappointment. should've left it alone!
. good app
limited to the essentials. great app!
. i have down loaded the app but its not working properly its frustrating
app doesn’t work on ios 11. don’t waist time
purchased but won’t work.. i can not contact customer service to save my life!! i purchased this after my trial but it won’t acknowledge that i have. very upset and frustrated!!!
very good. excellent app that syncs with qbo.
. easy to use to add expenses
great product. i like this app. can use from just about anywhere
doesn't work for ipad. this app doesn't even load my company info. it keeps returning error trying to load company info. i have contacted quickbooks a number of times and all they say is they are working on the issue and to use a web browser version in the mean time. i have seen about 4 updates released and not one of them has fixed this issue. when will this be fixed?
many bugs. need to fix bugs that cause the app to not follow the regular online access. employees can see things they shouldn't (like business income) and are unable to do things they should like entering customer info and invoices.
pretty good. limited invoice customisation is annoying but otherwise pretty good. app works great.
#1 business app. after trying many programs, including all of quickbooks packages, quickbooks has the best tools for running your startup.
user friendly!. this is definitely the bookkeeping app for anyone who is not attuned to being a business owner
. love it! makes my accounting software much easier. no time wasting and sent direct to the customer and most times get paid straight away. fabulous!
so far so good!. this app has come in very handy!
download app just to be taken to the browser.. not the self employed version.
. the app always crashes on me, and now i can't even get it to open.
really frustrating app. very frustrating app both on iphone and qbo. very glitchy and customer support is terrible. if the they didn't force you to use a subscriptionbased model, i'd use the installable version on quickbooks. i'm sure other have less problems, but it has not been a good experience for myself or my company.
great. so nice to be able to do invoices on the run. very user friendly!
why???. for the love of gawd, why can i not add a delayed charge on the mobile app?????? this is something you actually want to do when you're at a client, not get them to sign for an invoice every time you visit them during the month.
good. great product however cannot get online payment via paypal to work. also would be convenient if could add accounts via the app and not need to log onto computer.
. ok app email invoice doesn't work version 3.8 been unable to send invoices via email for over a week now.
completely useless for me. i need to receive payment by invoice number like i can do on the desktop and web version. this doesn't allow for that. useless.
linking bank to quickbooks. still trying to link usaa with quickbooks. i think it's on the bank's end. until we get this issue resolved it's four stars.
"cumbersome. cumbersome and clunky to deal with. constantly checking to make sure i'm not a robot. security is appreciated but this is ridiculous and really slows me down. used to be good but got updatedtweaked""improved"" past the point of being useful. now i dread having to use it."
. exceptional support
. if i could give it a half star i would. i have a customer who paid me a week ago through my invoice and it still hasn't reached my account how can i run my business if my money wont be put into my account?
no supplier invoice. invoices from suppliers can not be captured on the app. you have to log onto the main website  which is extremely slow and cluttered to navigate on a mobile phone.
good app, but could be better. the app is good but could be better with more functionality. for example not being able to add 'bills' but you can add 'expenses' a small change but would make the app much better.
. well after the experience so far it's great when i need to merge all apps at home then i can rate better. customer service has been just awesome so far. thanks
. since the most recent update i cannot see my dashboard or add expenses to my company. fix it. done all diagnostic steps so this update is invalid. galaxy s10+ here
. this app has made tracking my expenses a breeze , now i don't have a big pile of receipts because i enter everything as i go
great for small startup. just started using the app as the business grows it has been easy to track travel expenses and everything else we need to keep growing.
. great app, very helpful. has a few glitches that can be frustrating.
. quickbooks is perfect for managing your business expended and for generating invoices and receipts.
great app. easy to use
. quickbooks lover for years so app is right for me
i like the app. quickbooks come with a handy app which is great. don't have to work only on desktop.
. nice and easy app
excellent!!. does everything it's supposed to
google calendar. it would be nice to be able to sync google calendar with the mobile app for invoices like you can do on the mac app.
. this is a easy to use app and makes keeping track of finances easy
. grat app now with the new version and updates this is the best app for contractors like myself that are always in the field.
. great app
need ability to accept and categorize bank transactions. an app is supposed to make our lives better. all the bells and whistles in the world to date on qb app don't help if i can't sync my bank and credit card transactions while on the go. can't this be prioritized? surely i'm not the only user who needs to clear my banking transactions and relies on that for expense side.
. awesome app. helps me keep on top of all of my accounting as i go and super easy to navigste. highly recommend.
. great app
. good app. looking forward to the future and a full use of the online version in the app.
. app doesnt start until i hit link 4 ot 5 times
quickbooks. excellent software. easy to use both at home and on the go with mobile device.
great product. i couldn't be happier with this app is the best of the best, probably the purchase i ever done for my business
easy to use.. quickbooks online is such an easy package to use. great for small or large companies.
can’t create multiple companies. can’t create multiple companies or entities with this program. i would have to pay a subscription fee for each company. if i wanted to track my individual expense, my business expenses, and my llc expenses i would be stuck for $720 a year when the 2013 version on my laptop could create unlimited companies and only cost $300 paid in full.
. love it! super easy to learn and use
new horizons glass wa. works great. do all my bidding and estimates with this app.

. loved it, but acting up again. when i add something to an invoice (on s8) then hit done, the refreshed invoice lines are all out of order and duplicated. uninstalled and reinstalled, still doing it. not working on tablet either. please fix asap.
review. not quite as intuitive as i expected but otherwise useful app
does not support multiple currencies. hope they can add multiple currencies soon. it's useless if you have a primary currency other than usd.
deceiving. silly me. i thought quickbooks had somehow released a free service. i installed this app, and the first thing i am presented with is a screen asking me to sign up for a free trial. sorry, $12.99 per month is just not worth it for quickbooks until they finally build a decent rental business module. i hate being tricked into downloading apps that are actually not free.
. i had an inapp issue and received help immediately. i love this app and really appreciate you guys. you make my life a lot easier, 💯💯
estimate layout. i like the way the app works, i have problems when i need to include a lot of info on the estimates. when i send it it leaves the first page blank and cuts of some of the info on the second page. overall great though!
nice interface, would like more features. works well for basic tasks. needs a few more features to be really helpful.
. not easy to work with and cost. can't recommend.
. awesome app for my business
. they just did a huge update and didn't change any of the items i'm having problems with. the app is useless to me with line items abbreviated. how do i know what i'm entering?
. great app. been using it to run my business for the last 3 years and loving it still.
amazing. this app is a life saver! started my own hvac company in march of 2015 and this is the only app i use for keeping track of finances, invoicing, payroll and taxes. it really makes running my business as easy as possible! love it, thanks quickbooks!!
wish i started a long time ago. with a service business, being able to keep up on paperwork throughout the day with the mobile app is a huge time savings. i wish there was a side bar that would allow easier navigation though.
. i have always been loyal user of qb. this app is great.
handy, but needs work. the app is pretty hand for some of my clients to invoice on the go or take photos of their receipts. i find it a little too dumbed down for my uses. i would love to be able to add delayed credits and charges and drill down on the financial statements. it would also be great to pull other reports, not just p&l and balance sheet.
. great app
still does not allow entering employee time. the ability to enter employee time is a must for professionals that are on the road all day. other services like freshbooks already have this ability. until intuit makes this very important addition to the mould app, it does not deserve 5 stars!
. very slow to load and often locks up.
amazing improvement in technology. we operate a wholesale division, a small brick & motor store, and two large ecommerce platforms that we participate in. quickbooks online and the combination of some of the apps will completely revolutionize how we process our accounting and retail transactions. saving us countless hours of time and increasing productivity
good for at a glance. very basic facility, but better than nothing. estimates that are not accepted do not show up, frustrating if you are with your customer and trying to complete a deal.
. good but receipt scanning needs to be like the self employed app, if possible. do that and 5 stars for def
. very good, i am on trial not sure how much full experience will cost, i'll update when i can
awesome app. i really like this app, i can track all my incomes and expenses, it shows my net profit and everything else i could possibly need. i really enjoy using this app.
. i think this app is a great addition to the computer and laptop for the small business owner on the go.
. excellent just sometimes login doesnt register
app. using this app is like being your own accountant. it helps keep track of your income and expenses. i highly recommend to all self employed people.
highly recommended. it saves me a lot time from working on invoices and so. it help me on whenever i need it, i just have to take out my phone and i'm able to use what i need to.
amazing, powerfull and simple. switched from sageone and wow, for the same price i get a much better mobile app, that actually do more, and is very simple to use. and the last update made it even better with the overall view.
latest update is garbage. app has been great up until 3 weeks ago now it no longer works! crashes every time i try to open the app.
. qbo a great experience, seamless on mobile and desktop. highly recommend!
why the love. app just doenst work well  slow and just not a great experience.
signed out automatically. every time i launch the app it signs me out and i have to log in over and over. please fix this issue. it is annoying.
limited company. absolutely brilliant. allows me to create and send clients invoices no matter where i am. without doubt the best accountsbusiness management system available. so simple to use and effective
. the app works well.
great app. love this app!
nice app but i’d like to access the inventory. when you are out and making an invoice it is very important to be able to check the inventory
very nice to use. great app
. great app!!
. great app... i like that i can do everything i need to do, and it updates on my other devices too. i would like the option to print invoices from the app that would be a great update.
. great app
. this app is not free! as soon as i signed in, it asked for money!
great app. i'm a technology consultant and really appreciate the flexibility this app affords for invoicing clients and getting paid on the spot.
poor service. stopped connecting to my bank account so can’t link transactions and service and support is terrible and cannot work out why. won’t be using again and will be cancelling.
get it. this program is truly life saving. having a small business especially, knowing i can keep complete and accurate records for myself and family is everything. a must buy product
recommend for one stop booking & accounting. i tried many softwares for accounting , the only reason i choose this platform because of its graphics & designs , the dashboard itself give you a ray of positivity , they design the dashboard and entire platform graphics in future aspect. apart from it there customer service is also and helpful. cheers !! ashutosh
nice work. each revision makes the app even better. i did not appreciate the price increase but if the service continues to improve then it is valuable to my organization.
replacing invoice2go after 7years. excellent software
easy to use. great app to use
. quickbooks is useful for non finance managers like myself. hopefully improvements will continue on some of the less obvious areas
. it takes a little while to get used to the interface after switching from desktop, however having all my financials updated in real time and at my fingertips is awesome! wish i would have switched years ago!
. useless app. not user friendly. waste of money. major disappointment
signature doesn't work with ios 9. my signature for my invoices that i need to get paid on no longer works with ios 9. still no update!
. problem tried to sync my company data, refresh it. and now the app crashes as it is loading my company invoices. it seems to log in fine. just gets hung up when trying to load. was working great at the end of last year. but now it won't work....please help! i was using the app a lot. just want it to work again. p.s. i am using a galaxy s4 android 4.3 thanks!
. can't add items i used to live this app. i wished it would work when i add a item. to my invoices evertine i tap add item and choose my item to add it says error add item. it reallly stinks because i loclve using this app while i am in the road. now i habe to bring my computer and take time to find wi fi hot spots to use my computer please fix thia problem. our help me fix it
very disappointed. ever since i updated it doesn't save my expenses and crashes a lot. very disappointed.
great bookkeeping app. this is a great app for tracking expenses sending invoices and overall bookkeeping. it is especially great if you are a mobile service and always on the go, easytouse from your phone or tablet or computer!
scanning receipt yet to be as effective.. i was using neat desk for scanning and it captures all bills. if quick book cannimprove receipt scanning for cab and other bills it will be wonderful.
. i'm amazed by how much i can do quickly in the app, but the number of touches it takes to switch back and forth between screens gets old fast. the app dies every time i switch to a different app to look up a piece of information, and when i start the app back up, it has completely forgotten what screens i was last in.
works well. good app
. awesome to keep my books neat, love how i can send and estimate via my mobile.
aka labels. great app. highly recommended
. easy and quick to use for estimates, invoices , receipts and keep track of expenses and income
. i've been using quickbooks for a few years. it's been great. but lately i haven't been able to access old invoices or quotes. very inconvenient for past work that we've done. now i'm having a huge issue with latest data not syncing to my device and can't even get into my account. things should be getting better not worse. i've consulted with customer service which hasn't helped either.
excelente aplicación. tengo un negocio de control de plagas y esta aplicación me a permitido realizar cotizaciones y facturas mientras estoy fuera de la oficina.
. works well. there are some functional restrictions from the desktop app. but works well enough
so simple and quick to use. i have downloaded the app and have been using it for my self employed hairdressing. it is so easy to use and because i use my phone often it's great to pick it up at the end of the day and track my takings in which means i never have to worry about not being up to date. i would highly recommend this to anyone who wants an easy and simple way to keep detailed accounts!
can't edit customers. you can make new customers but once one is in there you can't edit them unless i go to my pc
"too many missing features. can't add time entries, even simple ones, have to pay (a lot) for a third party app. not acceptable for a single user company that doesn't sell products, only time that needs to be tracked. can't view current ""sales"" status of unbilled items. can't email myself receipts and have them automatically entered as expenses bank transactions that i've excluded keep showing up. again and again. i'd like to configure away unused modulesfunctions from the menu"
lacking features on the app. the online version is good and it has a lot of features. i hope to see them available on the app as well soon.
. awesome app makes life simple for small businesses
sooooooo easy. each update gets better and better, making bookkeeping easier and easier.

quickbooks. excellent software, app is realy handy tool
. conforme já relatado por outros usuários, o app oferece uma promoção de r$13,99. porém ao efetuar a compra o valor é quase r$50,00... engana na propaganda então já parto do princípio que o restante pode não ser bom!
update needed. for the past three weeks has not been tracking the miles. otherwise a 5 star app when working properly.
. hands down the worst customer service system i've ever dealt with. not once have i called that i wasn't on hold for 15 minutes to then have the person transfer me to someone else because they couldn't help me. i'm currently having the money taken from my account but am being told my account doesn't exist and i have to sign up for a new one.
. love this app
. cool great app
excellent!!!. i just love this app. i has allow me to invoice and collect payment at the point of sale without the paper work fuzz. it has allow me to improve my cash flow while increasing my efficiency while i am in the field. my only regret, i should have implemented much sooner into my mobile service.
. i use this app while i had my quickbooks trial, and it seemed to be working fine. the minute i subscribed, the app stopped working properly. i emailed support, no one seems to be answering my questions, and when i phone the customer service, they don't know how to help with the app. i'm stuck and ready to cancel the whole thing.
. desktop site works great, mobile site is trash and i can't even log into my account through app. says i don't have an account? okkkkk. tried reinstalling but no dice. i'll stick with the desktop site thanks
. very easy to use mobile app means i can invoice quickly!
great app for business.. a ++ must have app
user friendly. i can keep track of and operate my business from my phone. love it!
. great but like any software you have to take time to learn its capabilities and bugs
great app for my business. so easy to use this on the go. love it.
awful. doesn't work.. logs me out instantly every time i sign in... wish i could evaluate more. love the online version, but this app is struggling.
doesn't refresh. it doesn't update on mobile devices.. plz fix it so that it will be more convenient
almost useless. the app is good for sending invoices only. don't expect to be able to do any other business on the app. the mobile site is about as good as healthcare.gov. you can look at some things but forget everything else. again good for sending invoices only. i expected more from a established company.
. my wife has this app and it works well for her business. i got this app based on her recommendation but unfortunately it has been full of technical difficulties. several hours wasted on talking to tech support and was told the tech team might resolve issues in a week. all details of my invoices are erased and wrong dates are shown on all invoices amongst other problems. wish they could solve this faster, has been very stressful experience so far for me.
crashes on open. useful app until this update. it crashes on open, both on ipad and iphone. cannot do business this way...
. good app for a start up business and it will grow with your business.
. this is not for bookkeepers i uninstall this app
sales tax calculation is wrong. when creating an invoice, the app does not honor customer's sales tax setting. it applies tax even on customers with tax turned off. please fix asap!!!!
. very disappointed, missing 6 months of transactions from my bank, tried to fix it as i was instructed to but couldn't, you can't get someone to speak to, no customer service. big joke, i don't recommend it to anyone
. slow customer service meant i was unable to upgrade from qbse to quickbooks online. tried clear books instead, app is not great but otherwise they are a vast improvement, particularly the bank sync which is so much more reliable. i get the feeling qb have grown too quickly and do not have the infrastructure to support their customers.
useless. the app keeps crashing, if you’re in the middle of typing a long estimate or creating an invoice, it crashes and your file is gone, you have to keep saving your project, otherwise when it crashes, your project is gone. very disappointed, going to a different app or software at the beginning of the year, three years with this crap, paying high monthly rates, and for nothing.
i love it!. best app to use if you are constantly on the go.
ok but. reasonably happy with it but so many of my customers are also suppliers so i really would like an entity database where an entity could be both a customer and a supplier rather than having separate customer and supplier databases which necessitates the creation and therefore data entry for the same entity twice.
update???. aren't things supposed to get betterlol
great value. does all the basic accounting functions you would expect. nice to be able to operate away from desktop situation.
helpful, but limited.. it is good for a pinch, but it very limited in the interface.
very helpful. would love that they add a feature for partially paid invoices
. great app. i have had excellent customer service experiences.
. is it possible to link this app with my desktop quickbooks software?
. great app. very easy to use
quickbooks online. the app can be frustrating at times to use, not enough flexibility. can't make up its mind wether to ask me to sign in or use finger print login. need option to control where deposits go.
. malfunctions on every level. did not attach a single receipt picture to the transaction. brought in the bank accounts and scrambled them. even on the desktop deposits are expenses and you cannot edit them
very easy to use. the app works flawless. being able to sign in with biometrics, take photo of receipts and capture expenses quickly is one of the many great feature.
. having a business that is mobile and takes cash payments this app is brilliant. can't find a way to automatically assign mileage to each sales receipt... that would be invaluable!
. does what it says on the tin
good app. good app more functionaly could be added
great features but very unstable and poor support. i’m an accountant that works with xero, qb and myob. quickbooks online offers probably the best combination of xero and myob’s best features but is let down hugely by the app’s instability (very slow and regularly crashes) and their support, whilst very friendly, is poor in quality and suffers from obvious lack of proper systems and workflow. we’re holding off recommending qb to clients for these two reasons. they aren’t quite deal breakers but close.
great app. makes life easy. one addition will make it perfect. add journal entry to the app.
welshman. love it. simple for me to send estimates & invoices from the field.
works great. really like being able to manage invoices on the go for my small business
. great app
qb app. this app worked fine but up until this recent update there are a few glitches and it shuts down in the middle of updating and invoice!
. love the app, makes running my business so much easier.
. great app. saves time and simplifies billing customers on the go.
love it. just be cautious when trying 30 free trail. i loaded half a dozen customers and lots of estimates,invoices etc. and then purchased the 6 month subscription after i got familiar with software. well it led to doing work twice. because you can only have one or the other, free trail discounted 6 months subscription.
be careful. i loved this app for 10 months. then an error occurred and i lost access to my business. only cost me $200 for one time fix. for $600 i could have purchased a 3 month fix. the risk exceeds the benefit.
login. i can't get my country grenada or it's currency to start the process
. good so far only on trial run right now
. generally a good piece of software... but, if you happen to get an unusual glitch don't expect much help. two of our invoices have been resent to a client 3040 times per day for the last four months. my customer is upset and my bookkeeper has wasted days of time on hold or explaining the exact same situation to countless tech support. come on @intuitbrad is this the best your team can do?
. good app, but please can you add mode of payment to sale receipts and receive payment. anytime i do sale receipt on the app, it post the cash directly to undeposited fund account i created instead of bank account of cash and cash equivalent that i created... please help us fix this pls
pretty lame. seriously? the thing crashes a lot , but i can deal with that. the real problem for me is the lack of calendar in the invoice line item. i would love to use this, but if i can't put the date that i provided a service in my invoice, the it is useless to me. too bad safari doesn't work either, or i would just use that.
love quickbooks hate new limited invoice styles update. love quickbooks hate new limited invoice styles update
so convenient!. i can access accounts and bill clients immediately after appointments. it is very easy to navigate and accomplish what i need done!
business saver. great for onthego business needs. allows me to create invoices and send to customers for immediate payments. everything i need!
. why does it keep saying that there is technical difficulties in using the app? even before prior update, it had this issue. no issue with the ios app though
cannot link to amex. caution, you can no longer use the mobile app to link to your american express account. i first installed it in 2015 it was awesome because it linked to my american express account and i could go through and enter them into quickbooks very easily. now unfortunately they have just simply discontinued that feature for some reason and their technical support people refuse to even acknowledge that they used to do it in the first place
. useful app
changed my life..!. qbo has made the bookkeeping side of my business a dream. it has given me so much time back. if i forget the rest my business to run as smoothly, i would be a happy man…
. this app takes forever to do anything. it literally takes a minute just to open after i tap the app icon. completely useless. information is not reflected correctly during use. just use a web browser instead.
cannot reconcile bank accounts on app. cannot reconcile on the app. completely useless to me as the bookkeeper.
solid app. i can invoice my customer on the way home on the train, and do just about anything else i need.
awesome app!:. this is perfect for on the go invoices and quotes for businesses.
. amazing app for business
. big time saver allows me too stay in the field, no need to make a trip to the office, no problems at all, love it.
last update ruined a great app. invoices won't save now and a customer file disappeared. please fix this app back to operational use soon!
useless. this app is useless. you can't even see your check register. pathetic.
buggy. crashes all the time. always bugging to buy things. bad. uninstalled
ios 13. keeps crashing in ios13 faceid log in  can u fix it please. thank you all fixed now
. can't even get started. created an account and tells me i have 30 days but then tells me i have no subscription whenever i attempted to log in.
worst service. changed a template i have used for invoices and estimates for 5 years without warning or reason i cannot access the ones i sent even one week ago customer service said i was using a classic template and it's gone and not coming back . makes zero sense it's 2017 get a clue . don't buy don't join charge back!
when i am done, i am done!. as a contractor i love to do my estimates one time, hit convert to invoice one time, hit receive payment one time and i am done with my paperwork and money is heading my way before i leave the job site. when i get home i can just spend time with the family rather than swim through paperwork. great service!
. very good app. make invoices in a snap.
great app. i've been using this app since starting our business last year and i don't know what i'd do without it. i love the program. when i started the business i had no idea how to do anything, but this program is very straightforward and makes running our business a breeze. you guys replied almost instantly and now it's working for me again. that's awesome. thank you! i don't know what i'd do without quickbooks. highly recommend this for anyone with a business.
great app.. will help me tract expenses!!
great app. very user friendly. easy to edit and add customers.
let's me keep my members accounts current. i need to be able to scan credit card's and and take payments from my members at our weekly meetings and this app helps me see their balance and details at a glance. i'd be lost without it.
. i thought it was bad three years ago! its much worse now. not user friendly and still doesnt support my form of business. all they really do with this app is track your bank account and catigorise things. you can only catigorise as an expense or income. its the new year and new month and its counting transaction from jan 2019 as transactions from december 2018. i need help. any recomendations on business softwesr that also has tax softwear?
love it. easy to use and understand. have recommended it to everyone i know. great app.
great mobile app. perfect for my mobile power washing company as all my customers and estimates are available at the touch of a button no matter where i am!
. very useful for small and midam business company
. working great, really makes it simple
not accurate, crashes often. this app goes from being usable to worthless on a whim. it also does not show simple things like how many $ in open invoices, (right now it says we have $488 in total receivables, when we have way more). the desktop app is fine, the ios app needs a ton of work.
not free. this is a free trial, and that is what it should say. now it is going to take me 2 hours to get it removed off all of my devices! annoyed!
pretty complete finance from your phone. i'm not too sure about the need for a separate app for payroll, but this does work as advertised for the most part.
. this app is just perfect. simple and easy to use and anyone without any accounting background can easily adapt to use it. 👍
"gary. customers complain that they cannot see your company's remittance address and are confused by the presence of a ""pay now"" button which doesn't work unless your company subscribes to additional services and fees."
credit card interface is awesome. i know all apps aren't perfect, but this one does everything i need. i'm so happy when i can set up a new client, invoice and receive payment immediately! this has really improved my cash flow!
. didn't login in for a couple weeks, and they removed all of my account data. worthless.
. it does, what i needed to do
love it. amazing i don't know what i would do without this app.
. this app keeps getting error loading items, to invoice and estimates can't use it. i call them for support and they have no support they referred me to log in on the web site and the same happens the search button flashes and dispensers. don't waste your time and money. if any one know about a good and reliable app let me know. this one is not reliable nor is their support.
. easy to work with, fast, and email integrated for invoicing is smooth. wish i had more control over forms to make look like mine. but great app really.
getting better with every upgrade.. great app. they do lure you with the free use then hit ya with the charges later. i think it's a useful tool in the toolbox.
works great for me!. i love this app! it is nice to be able to create invoices, accept payments, and email invoices on the spot. no more waiting to get back to my computer for data entry.
jtw1234567. awesome app. i don't have time to do all of this and run my business too.
can't log in on nexus 5x. i haven't been able to log in on my nexus 5x for 23 months (maybe longer). i can get to the login screen and put in my credentials, but when i click next it errors. tried uninstalling and reinstalling. even installed a qb app update recently if i remember correctly. still can't log in. tried emailing info to support, but i still have the same problem. i can login from my computer or ipad mini just fine.
. difficult to use. much different than the desktop version. i only use it if i am desperate. cant even find existing transactions or quotes .
good app. helps me run my business in paperless mode. crashes when i push terms while creating invoice or estimate. please fix this.
roofing business. i have been using quickbooks for almost a year for my husband roofing business and i love it! why we are out looking at jobs i can do an invoice on my phone and email it right away to the customer! and i can go home and work from laptop as well! i recommend quickbooks for book keeping for business!
major flaw. the app ui is pretty good and i really like the interface. the problem is that a lot of my invoices are not even viewable on the app. basically anything that has a delayed charge on it won't show up so there is a major glitch there or something.
okay. i'm new to doing my own bookkeeping and find this product clunky and not very easy to use. issues with importing transactions and program changing dates and the order compared to the bank. it's not very easy to see what account transfers are moving tofrom. it's hard to distinguish credits for debits. poor customer service. no good summary graphs. slow to attach receipts. multiple clicks to do basic things. cuts off file names if there too long.
perfect. changed over from using sage about 6months ago and have never looked back, excellent software, the app makes it completely agile and useable on the move.
. i have had this app for my business for about 1 year. every time i spent the money new transection comes up 2 time . and it's too hard to remove on transection.
app doesn't work at all. after attempting to log in several times the app crashes every time. i cannot rely on it for work so it's useless.
meh. so slow loading new pages invoice templates are ugly hard to view invoice view doesn’t quite seem “google” more like a government website that got a makeover
. newer to the app, so still learning all the in and out of it. but easy to use
. i can no longer create or see invoices. my home page is literally blank except for the header and the home menu buttons on the bottom. edit: a solution was found that works for me. i had my account switched to administrative and i'm no longer having issues.
. excellent app
. very excellent apps
love it!. quickbooks has changed the way we invoice and track expenses. the ability to provide estimates then convert to invoices is amazing. the mobile app allows me to work on the go.
. very handy for on the go small business tasks
excellent. you can do so much with just this app  absolute game changer. love it.
need packing slip option. add the option to send packing slips from the mobile app
quickbooks app. great app. really useful.
great app. if the sales history chart can show more than one year will be perfect ( at least 2 yrs )
bad update. used to work good until last update now when i open the app is says downloading company data, gets stuck there for ages. if it finally loads, there are no customer invoices, just payments. tried deleting the app and reinstalling but does the same thing. the pc app works fine and my employees have samsung phones and they haven't complained of any issues may just be an iphone app problem.
track time. so far i’m pretty unhappy with this app because i thought that i could use it to track my time while i was with a client with a timer. i know that i read that somewhere when i was researching this app. that would have been a perfect feature. if this is something that i can actually do and someone can let me know how to do it i will change my rating to 4 or 5 stars.
. simple and very efficient! send invoices ..receipts taxes. everything in one place! love it!
great improvement!. makes entering expenses & invoicing so much easier.
needs to improve. the more i use this the more i find things that annoy me. when reconciling the bank why can i not just add a receipt photo to a bank transaction. that way i don't have to add it as an expense then match the bank transaction. it would save me time. seriously considering giving xero a try.......
easy as pie. certainly has improved my business
. excellent very useful app for business purpose.
app barely compatible with computer. the the features on the app and computer barely cross over and i can never find customers on the app that i have on my computer so i have to jump back and forth to make things work.
easy to use. a very easy to use software that is cloud based with a great phone app. i’ve been using this for some time now and it evolves every year. most for the best. a helpful help call centre should you have any problems. 4 stars as i don't believe you can back this up
too expensive. would give it 5 stars if it was cheaper $20 for just invoices give me a break
business on the run. quickbooks online with the ios app make operating a travel based business on the run simple. log invoices as you go. input estimates along the way. print and mail or email all at once at the end of the day. not to mention the helpful reports and expense management. i couldn't run my business without it.
. great with invoices and estimates on the go. and i can see our sales dashboard wherever we go.
works great. good app. works great on the road for creating fast invoices on site. great companion app for quick books am dos fully functional.
great improvement!. makes entering expenses & invoicing so much easier.
. recording expenses has not worked since july 2017. support from quickbooks has been hopeless and no fix in sight
app crashes constantly. i used to love this app. the last couple of months the app crashes daily and multiple times. i’m in the middle of working and the app says critical updates are needed and logs me out. i’m extremely frustrated with this considering i pay over $20month to use this software across all my devices.
. a great awesome business app lets you control your finances and send off invoices
doesn't work. app doesn't sync all data with quickbooks online. i see only my company name and customer list. no invoices, expenses etc. intuit support we're not able to help.
so much better than sage. we moved from sage to this and haven’t looked back. the app is better and the links to banks work (unlike sage). the help and support is better than sage too. all in all, well worth a trial.
. works amazing when having to do my invoices on the fly and can't get to the office. also to check my estimates
good but it needs a work!. quickbooks online is just brilliant, but on the android app you can't switch between companies only by signing out (unlike windowsmac app it's just a matter of a pull down)
best small business app!. awesome app! very helpful
. very effective app fkr my business, just starting to link in with using receipt bank to auto match the bills. happy recommend for small business, would ve nice to have mileage part of the self employed version included too.
. this app is eady to use and keep all my business expenses in one place!
works good for me. i use quick books to invoice, put in costs, and see roughly how the company is doing financially. easy to use. i read all reviews but some are not liking it while others do. depends on what your using it for. simple and easy that's what i like.
new update 1120. your new update is garbage. app shuts down immediately when it’s opened.
great for tracking business and personal expenses. great app
. worst customer support ever i write email to contact for support they say it's for global support then again i write email to india support they send me to us supposed.sad no response from the company first they sell at 4500 then next week its 500
update is awful.. please fix the app. it was great until the last update!! can't even get tech support without it crashing.
makes business easy!. this app is perfect for the small business owner like me.
not accurate. even after the most recent update the app still dose not accurately reflect my qbo account. all information on vended and clients are not up to date. this had been an ongoing issue for more than a year now. i keep hoping with every update this will be correct, but nothing yet.
touchid. touchid or pincode does not seem to work for login. it never gets asked when the app starts even after enabled. please fix. thanks.
convenient. works great. i love that i can keep track and update transactions wherever i am.
. great app. makes quoting and billing a breeze.
. data always not updated. when try to update manually, it takes a very long time.
no other compares. no other accounting software appprogram compares or gives you the power and knowledge at your finger tips. great app. easy to use. tons of features. perfect or managing your business on the go!!
. handy but a bit slow
job costing would be great. my only complaint is that i don't have the ability to truly categorize expenses and income by the job. i use the locations feature, and it is a decent work around, but not quite as seamless as other software. i love the app for field access!
features bugged and gets worse every time they update it. transactions page on ios 13 doesn’t respond atall, you can categorise and transactions or match payments. stop updating the app when you haven’t tested it thoroughly... it’s getting to the point i’m going to start looking elsewhere.
. it is an exellent accounting application which allow me to be on the right truck with my daily expeneses and income.
simple and easy. i find the app and the computer program simple and easy to navigate. i operate my small business using quickbooks and i am yet to have an issue.
so so.. while intuit has made many improvements in the last few years the iphone app is virtually useless. the ipad version is a slight improvement but neither app allow access to the most commonly accessed information. oh well.
. horrible, spent 2 hours trying to cancel subscription. they don't have the cancel button. called them...45 min wait. terrible service.
. update: no longer freezes but is now saving estimates and invoices multiple time and showing 70k extra in income from invoices and bank deposits which it's now not allowing us to match payments with invoices so our only current option is to delete all duplicate payments and have customers outstanding balances until this is fixed
. very miss leading and is nothink like the tv advert. not to easy to use and over all disappointed. having to use it because of my accountant. no impressed!!!! also no english call centre's! you can't understand the customer help line team as there english is poor. needs english call centres employing english to overcome this problem!!!!!
. we use this to track our business expenses and are so pleased with the functionality of it! it just gets better with each update.
. uggghhh..... why oh why oh why do developers continue to stuff things up with updates! get it right or leave it alone. how do i roll back to last version that worked?
. fantastic app!!! reliable and extremely convenient
quickbooks. this app is excellent and the version on my computer is even better save's me hours when quoting well worth the money.
at your fingertips. it's nice to be able to send invoices and check your books anywhere you are. haven't had any issues.
. difficult to navigate. starts with fairly useless information that cannot be sorted. does not sync for days on end, so it isn't current. cannot view statements or email one from the field. edit: it is getting easier to navigate and shows more useful information.
no supplier invoice. invoices from suppliers can not be captured on the app. you have to log onto the main website  which is extremely slow and cluttered to navigate on a mobile phone.
love it, but needs some work. reeeallly wish i could cut a po on the app. other than that, the app is a great tool
great for small startup. just started using the app as the business grows it has been easy to track travel expenses and everything else we need to keep growing.
the app used to work?. why do companies change apps from functional to crash is beyond me?
. on the android version i can't go back farther than 12 months to view invoices. also adding discounts are not easy, so there is a delay in sending invoices until i get to my computer.
. i use it to attach photos to my transactions.
. great program
. can't seem to input expense reports with the app
best business app!. so easy to use!! very clear info and graphs make it quick and easy to check your profit and loss and see exactly where you spend money and where the most income is coming from!
i love quickbooks!. if you have a small business, using quickbooks is a no brainer! awesome program and i would highly recommend it!
contractor. amazing product for having customers and businesses on point and updated on the spot
great app!. our company switched from quickbooks desktop to the online version which came with the option to download the app. we now use the app more than online. we handle estimates, invoices, payments, banking and more directly in the app and on the go. the app has a simple and clean look making it easy to navigate. to date we haven't had any issues with it. we are excited to finally be able to get things done in less time!
works well. this app is far better than the desk top program for mac. as a small business i have many more things i need to do than spending time learning a program. it allows easy access for my accountant and mobility for me!
need to improve!. the sole trader app is great for what i do including logging travel however i am registered for gst and therefore cannot use it. i have to go to the online version and just discovered you have to buy the plus version to link to recommended logbook app. qb you need to provide gst to the sole trader app or at the very least provide the same logbook function for the other qb packages.
. wish i never started using quickbooks. i can't connect to my bank anymore . got the new app logged in and they want another subscription off me. waste of time and money. no actual support apart from the automatic ok ne which is as much use as a chocolate fireguard.
won't work after update. won't work after update
. amazingly easy app to use for profitloss and invoicing for my small business. well worth the money.
happy. so far so good, but needed my accountant to help me make head n tails of it. i'm a worrier and was concerned about the financial side of my business. now i'm happy. taken the stress away.
great for invoices on the go. they charge things every so often after you get used to the way it is.
not good after update. used to send invoices via email through my phone android before update cannot anymore. called customer service told me to uninstall and reinstall still same problem.. had to buy an ipad in able to send invoices :( horrible!
amazing, powerfull and simple. switched from sageone and wow, for the same price i get a much better mobile app, that actually do more, and is very simple to use. and the last update made it even better with the overall view.
. does not work in india. restarts the phone . takes too long to uninstall
great app. added immensely to efficiency of our business and interface with customers
. good software
better than the rest. i keep trying to switch but end up back again because everything else sucks
hot garbage. latest update to this piece of garbage app requires you to log in every single time. pathetic these guys can’t get it right. update 020219; still has constant logout problems after all these years. would give 0 stars if i could.
not happy with this. i've used quickbooks for years and have several corporations that i handle on the program. i'm also computer literate and have been a quickbooks tester in the past i'm not happy that it took me a whole day to download and set up payroll and still haven't figured out how to print reports for my customers or check for that matter
quickbooks is quirky. i am not a fan because they just don't embrace mac users. the app is not reliably working.
. lacks functionality and still cannot access by bank account to reconcile. cannot recommend this app. avoid.
crash crash crash. it used to work but now it crashes right when i try to open it.
very useful. great app yo keep up with your income and expenses. i just love the way everything is set up.
. quickbooks is not stable as it should be and regarding support and response they are very lazy even basic business options are not available like we cannot see the prices in products and services etc
doesn't work. omg i'm so frustrated with this app...now it doesn't work at all on my note 5 i've report the error so many times and no reply
simple, yet capable. does everything i need and i love being able to use it online, iphone and ipad. on the go flexibility is a must and this app does that flawlessly!
great app. nothing like doing invoices from the phone!
. best accounting software! worst customer service ever!!!! hold times are hours & when you finally get a person, which is a miracle, they get offended if your upset & will hang up on you!they do not want to help you, just keep you trapped in their maze paying that monthly (rediculous) price! all they want is your money! & will hold your important business info & data entered as ransome. *horrible business practice*
love it. ian finally able to track my expenditures and income totally on the go. no more playing catch up! love that i have receipt images and that i can make notes that will refresh my memory on the exact thing i bought. just getting to putting my logo on invoices... i know that there is a lot mor that i can do with this program i am very much a beginner love what it does so far!!!!
. so far...i began adding my customers, payments, sales receipts etc, and it's working out well! pretty simple so far!
. since adding 3rd party, quickbooks has locked its own app from being able to communicate or work properly with it self. re installed 4 times. have 3 deposits top collect today and no way to record them. all for several thousand dollars. useless application... costing me money...
. since the update can't add trips for mileage. app was working perfectly before the update. app won't allow addresses to be added like before. why not just leave well enough alone?
mr reviewer. it's good software & handy
. very miss leading and is nothink like the tv advert. not to easy to use and over all disappointed. having to use it because of my accountant. no impressed!!!! also no english call centre's! you can't understand the customer help line team as there english is poor. needs english call centres employing english to overcome this problem!!!!!
very useful on day to day business. makes mobile invoice and payment tracking a breeze
. won't update, can't even click the help menus. save your money and get an accountant. just work more hours
. good and simple
. great for you business. i love how i can quickly add an expense by taking a photo of the receipt as well as logging payments on the go. its awesome that you have your data right there at the touch of a button.
low rating until the app supports chart of accounts. the app continues to be undeveloped for functions that are developed in the web interface. the app is excellent for invoices and credit card transactions if you have a merchant account coupled to your qbo account. the camera can be used in app to document your receipts to the cloud and i use it extensively for hotelairfarerental car expenses and they can be attached to invoices when emailing your customers.
great software. i have a small pest control business. this software is exactly what i was needing. between quickbooks with invoicing and the calendar on my phone, i don't need to get any of those high price business softwares....
crashed when entered a sales transaction. downloaded this app to see if i could use it instead of at a computer and the app crashed as soon as i tried to enter a sales transaction. i tried to enter in the receipt type and it crashed
". would give 5 stars if i could put a message on an invoice or estimate; like ""work location"""
awesome. it's taken me a couple of weeks to figure everything out but wow this a well thought out software and app!
slow.. not was easy as before. not much function as before. some new function was not useful
did update have had issues ever since. cannot download all of he files needed keep getting error code 10000. no resolution
great apps. easy to use
excellent tool for my biz. since i got this app on my phone i hardly need to go to the office, or open my laptop. love it!
great mobile app. this app is perfect for my business. i'm out of the office majority of the day so being able to send or create estimates and invoices is very nice. quick and easy
. customer service is absolutely horrible. signed up yesterday online. found out customizing invoices function has been broken for 3 months. call this morning to cancel subscription and get a refund. they're answer basically was we've got your money we're not going to refund it. you have been warned stay away from quickbooks
clumsy, error prone, price has doubled.. not a completely trash service, but it hasn’t gotten any better despite company promises. price has doubled since i initially joined. ipad app bugged, today i tried to enter an invoice payment, no joy. tried to leave service last year and the year before. exporting info was a nightmare, and impossible on mac, effectively leaving me held hostage. cancelling service at end of year as i’d rather try a different online accounting or simply go with a desktop version.
. worst billing app i ever had.. they give false promises before subscribtion. once the customer transfered money. no body will respond for our problems
great!. running my business has been so much easier since having quick books! invoices are no longer time consuming or hard :)
need other option. need an option for employees that travel to do trip expense that import as a bundle. i use pro premier 2015
total crap. this app doesn't work. it shows numbers which doesn't make sense, you can't rely on it. i just go to safari web and login to my quick books account. please change it if you can.
. this app has, literally, changed my financial standing. as a fantastic it engineer but rubbish at business management i would struggle to arrange invoices for the many small jobs that i do. now, with this app, i'm able to raise and send invoices on the spot!
excellent application. i like it, amazing app 👍🏼
problem. please update the quick book we are not able use from india..
unreliable. this app is buggy and slow. logging in is very hit or miss. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't for no apparent reason. i have not been able to log in for a week. all i get is an error message telling me to try again later. called support and i was told that they are working on it. this app has been out for years, and there is no excuse for it being so unpredictable.
home improvement. great app
. will not load dashboard. has not worked in a month. i've tried uninstalling and downloading a fresh version. nothing helps. we are a business user and this is a real inconvenience.
new version problems. ever since the last update, i can no longer categorize and add income and expense from the app. it seems the buttons to “add” do not work.
very powerful tool. the app is really nice and efficient. will get even better when the ability to create a credit note is made available on both ios and android devices. i really don't understand why this must have feature has not been added yet. thanks!
. i dont have a comment, but i do have a question. is this app beneficial to a incorporated contracting company, or is it more so set up for a cash and carry business structure.
recent update. crashes frequently! if editing an estimate or invoice on ipad it opens in a floating window that can slide down into the abyss and all progress is lost! very unhappy with the latest update!
. at some point the app stopped attaching photo receipts to my expenses. now i've lost several months worth of receipts.
efficient app. as a bookkeeper i use qbo for all of my clients as well as for my personal account. it just keeps getting better and better. accepting transactions is a breeze as is setting up invoices, paying bills, and writing estimates. one feature my clients find helpful is the receipt attachment. i would highly recommend this app for anyone who uses qbo.
great software. i have come to really like quick books online. quoting, invoicing, reports and my personal favourite... it links with your bank account to automate expense inputs. you set the rules once and the next time a similar transaction appears in your linked bank account it automatically categorises the transaction for you, just hit 'add'. saves me so much time and effort and to me it's fast becoming a business tool i simply wouldn't be without.
. great app very helpful when your business is on the go
excellent. great software
. please add 2 factor authorisation to the app instead of having to receive a text or email all the time when i log into the website.
. this app works great on my computer but will not allow you to accept deposits on a mobile device.
no way to categorize transactions. no way to access bankcredit card accounts to categorize transactions. what's the point of having the profitloss tab if that's the case??
personal accountant. brilliant softwareyou need to allow yourself a couple of hours to set up but once done it does all your reporting for you and keeps your finger on the pulse with your financial status  i love it!
. i can't view estimates on this app unless i input them in manually. they will not upload. only customer information and invoices. this makes it very hard to be onpoint with my crew.
app issue. i've been using the quickbooks app for over 6 months and it worked fine. now, for the past week the app will not let me access my company data or the data is incorrect after multiple reinstalls. this is very aggravating and qb's customer support stated it's an ios issue. please correct this issue asap. thank you
very good app. app is ok,but expense entry is still missing on mobile app. from the last update am not able to create invoice or add any items in this app.
app, subscription. cannot updat subscription gives error on can’t upload data, now expired, very frustrating need solution
great app. helps me keep everything straight with my business when i'm on the go.
mr. brilliant accountancy software,simple to use in the office or on the go.
too sophisticated for just personal budgeting. i have been using quickbooks since 2006 and its predecessor before 2006. i only use it for my personal budgeting of 14 bank accts, 10 mortgages and 6 credit card transactions. sometimes i cannot figure out how to enter a transaction (transfers between accts, accepting matching transactions, credit card individual transactons versus balance payment) without creating a double entry or it cancelling out an entry. love, love, love the online version that i can access via iphone.
. after installing and recovering my account details this app offers me some trial? should be stated somewhere beforehand.
"problematic app. upon originally downloading this app i was pleased. for the first 24hrs. i was impressed. then, i ""sent"" an invoice which the customer never received. next, it failed to update or sync with my account. when i attempted to update manually it chronically reported an error sighting that i should check my internet connection. frustrated, i uninstalled and reinstalled the app. now, it doesn't stay open for long before saying it stopped unexpectedly. i've reported every error without receiving any feedback."
recent update. thursday i updated my ios, then updated the app. it’s now crashing after sign in. please fix this, my phone is a xr
good if you use quickbooks for limited functions. lacks access to a lot of what exists in the full browser experience. particularly frustrating that not only can you not create a po, you cannot view them. other simple stuff missing or not quite matched up as far as fields being available for adding products, suppliers, customers etc. in light of them increasing their monthly subscription fees, hopefully some money is going to be spent bringing feature parity to their access tools.
can this app dethrone india specific software?. you can not setup this app to use for personal accounting. you can not setup this app for setting up multiple companies. you can not run if your internet connection is not working. so, this app is worth your time and money? you can try without worrying about any payment. so, it’s very difficult to dethrone india specific accounting software you already use. i have tried. you too can.
. great for small business people who invoice track estimate all on the go
. banking information is typically two days old. honestly it's a pointless app without an option to update banking information. i don't understand why this is not possible on androids. i was able to retrieve updated banking information on my iphone. banking data on the android app is up to 2 full days old. this means a trip back to the office for certain financial decisions and renders reports useless. it's a financial system. banking is a fairly important component of a business' finances!
makes life easier!!. quickbooks online, the app, and gopayment have all made my life so much easier. i can now track things in the go and accept payments right on my phone. it works seamlessly!
great program!. super convenient and easy to use.
". was a good app. now it will not exit upon entering an expense. upon entering all the info and clicking ""save"" it stays on the same screen. if you hit save 5 times thinking it's not working it saves the expense 5 times. you have to back out and click don't save the transaction but it will be there. intuit  please fix it."
. this app has never worked on my phone. it gives me the login screen, i enter my password, and the app force closes.
. good app
great app. there is no other app like it. this is probably one of the easiest apps to use and it is very userfriendly. i use it for my business and i have instant access on my iphone. you can send invoices on a moments notice.
sloooooooowwwww!!! iphone 6. very slow to do simple things like log an expense. camera feature is useless with crop feature. can i have the option to turn this off? just wanna take a photo without auto crop which 90% does a bad job. other than that its great :)
. great app for my small buisness. quickbooks is always improving. best customer service when you have questions.
. sales receipt and invoice not round off available in mobile apps create invoice not show retail invoice and tax invoice in mobile
mobile invoice and so much more. great app!.
excellent. really good app. carry your whole business in your pocket.
. error everytime i log in, and requires password so often
dissapointed. this is the frontline of my business as i am a mobil service technician. app no longer will save or complete an invoice. this is crippling my business! fixxxxxx please immediately!
owner. love this app!! easy to use and don't what i'd do without it
. downloaded this app 3 times and still close as soon as it opens. hard to use in the field if i can not get in.
tremendous. great app been using quickbooks over the years on desktop version specially go on mobile is the best way to go there is a couple tweaks that need to be worked on for example keeping track of inventory etc. and so forth been using quickbooks pro help ticket update these features as quickbooks from other than that it's a starter
. it's not perfect yet, but does what i need invoices and sales receipts in the field that i can print with my mobile printer. the recording part isn't as good as my desktop version but i know with time it will be improved.
employees. was charge $30 for three months for payroll, which i was not using. called the payroll department and they took care of me: refunded the cash into my account without question.
great app. makes my life so much easier!
. i got this to sync with my online account and it doesn't. also it won't let me add a sales tax. and so what's the point if i hafta enter everything into separate accounts.
loving it. been hunting for a simple app for managing the finances of my farm business. this helps me with capturing and analysis of all my expenses and income. the reporting is also amazing. i also love the fact that i can even get more stats and reports via the web. amazing stuff. already introduced it to quite a number of industry colleagues. truly an amazing app
asim hussain. loved the life
. fantastic app! amazing ability to invoice on the go.
quick rip for me.. i find this app so frustrating and difficult. i have had it for nearly a year, paying for the services i can't even use. i have been trying to cancel it but there seem to be no option on the app. the website is asking me to trial the whole thing again. i can't even call and talk to a person. hhhhelp. i need to cancel.
please add photo ability. please add the ability to upload photos to products and services! you have no idea how much that would simplify my life for me. please! other than that big issue (for me) i'm pretty happy with the way the app works  does all i need it to, except above mentioned issue.
office manager. makes my job so much easier to do, invoicing on the go!!
update ruined a great small business tool. quickbooks use to be an awesome tool to let us send invoices after a job is completed on the spot. it also allowed a user to edit payment information anywhere via the mobile app. this is now all gone thanks to the new update. if it is not fixed soon, we are looking into transferring our accounts to another system.
. makes my job so much easier!
jackrabbit. enjoy using this app. would like to see more options on bank balances
. epic cnc on the go with inuit quickbooks very nice app. couldn't do it without having it. very light... no heavy bog on my android devices nor google chrome. integrates easily with contacts making implementation super easy and painless. love the feature of being mobile and could based however the online version is definitely different from the software. intuit is doing it and doing it right!
. unable to log on anymore from one device, support seems unable to help me. also very disappointed i can't make an invoice in a no service area and have it sync up later. called and emailed support twice now and no updates or response in over a week.
. it's a great app
outstanding. i love the new quickbooks app it allows me to invoice and estimate my customers in a snap it also allows me to bring the point of sale in the home credit card processing is very easy also my favorite feature is that i am able to transfer my contacts into my quickbooks customer list with the press of a button
. good app
. terrible experience. app would regularly crash, bank accounts would continuously disconnect for no reason. frustrating and in no way time saving in the end.
yes please. great program, easy to use. perfect for startups!
don’t bother if you don’t have an accounting degree. this app is terrible. it doesn’t allow me to do anything that i need to day to day and then i have to go back at the end of the month and redo almost everything i have done for the month. waste of money and time. an excel spreadsheet is more accurate.
subscription renewal poorly thought out. i have been using qbonline for more than a year. it picked the worst time to time out and demand a subscription renewal. further it requires multiple logins and you must be st your desk top. nothing more frustrating than what amounts to a software crash when you are trying to get things done. huge fail quickbooks
excellent app for small business. been using this app for 2 years and we have no complaints. most efficient app for operating a small business. a+
owner. this us the easiest app to use for my business. able to bill my customers on the spot and keep track of all transactions.
. great app
iphone app is the worst. the iphone app doesn't work. their customer service people admitted it doesn't work. don't even try to use it  too frustrating and a big waste of time. online version and ipad versions are good but too limited for price  reports can't compare year over year
fix finally now i can get back to work.. this version fixed the errors from the last update. glad it working again. quickbooks has been good except the last update. this one fixed the issue. we us this app for our onsite business and it's great. several times i would send an invoice to the customer when i'm leaving their home and before i get to the next job it's already paid.
. where do i start. purchased to help with accounts for small self employment business. did not upload new transactions from bank account or paypal as advertised on app or the full site. mileage tracker was not accurate. user interface too basic. so frustrating as i would use this constantly but as it does not upload my transactions properly, it is unusable. far too glitchey as an app. wish i had done free trial and not wasted money on it.
essential tool. this app is the greatest tool for invoicing.
. app not working right now on my android. will not load data. has been that way for a day now.
. doesn't allow customers to have multiple properties addresses
ios 9 broke it. ios 9 broke the app and now every time it's trying to download company data just crashes. uninstalled and reinstalled. also wish you could accept transactions on this.
great idea, poor execution.. intuit needs to hire better programmers. if they could just make it possible to see transactions within a report it would be so much better
love the app. honestly this is the best app around, does it all with ease. i run my whole business through this app off my phone and tablet. never once had a problem.
. had difficulty with seeing my total mileage, but was guided by a rep.
. app is not working properly. suppliers details not showing in mobile app.
. reliable app however does not have all the features, available in the product range
forces login twice. app started logging out after i log in. forcing another login. worked great before that.
everything worked great until last update.. can't save invoices. have to login every time using password. payments don't apply to the invoices just to name a few. wish i hadn't updated.
. great app
handy invoicing tool when out and about. i use this app predominantly to invoice as i travel a lot in my job. it has been a bit of a game changer to be able to produce professional invoices on the go. and amazing to keep track of payments.
love it. makes accounting and payroll and taxes and everything a complete nobrainer.
no invoices. not very useful.
mixed bag and ball and chain. a great improvement over the years but the system breaks down at the worst times. today(friday) could not access any of the program for 4 hours. no invoices. no purchase orders. yikes!! when it works, it works well.
missing functionality. reliable app but authentication is too slow. also some features aren't available. i sometimes just use the web app through the browser to access those features.
best app for small business. excellent
confining.. pretty okay accounting software if you don't mind quickbooks owning you.
. really easy and all self employed services (invoicing, expense recording etc) in one place
crashes since update. i've tried to create a twoline invoice repeatedly since the update, and it crashes every time. will update review when it works.
. takes way to long to update between quick books online.
could not run a business without quickbooks!. i own a pool service. i love how quickly and easily i can enter information on the fly. it’s just as fast as scribbling a note between customers, and when i get home at the end of the day, it’s done! as long as i stay on top of my receipts, my taxes are practically done for me at the end of the year.
. needs to be updated equivalent to iphone app just switched to an android phone from an iphone. the iphone version was just updated with more features. this app needs to be updated as well. looking forward to the next release.
. very easy to use this program and sell explanatory. makes everything simple and painless.
. very useful
. how long has this app been out and it still doesn't work? i can update my bank feeds just fine on the website and pc version but the android app always errors out. clearing cache or reinstalling won't help. i get the same error on my phone and tablet. on my other tablet it just crashes to home screen completely. why am i paying for this again??
great. app used to be useless while desktop version did what i needed. now app is highly functional and i use it constantly for my business. great, reasonably priced. i highly recommend.
incomplete. the mobile app is not very useful compared to the online version, missing so many functions! like time sheets and billing be with them!
the planet. no better business software on the planet!
excellent program. we are extremely happy with this program, it has made our company administrators live so much easier.
confusing. i used the trial a little while ago, and sort of went off it. just renewed the subscription now with the exact the same email, but quickbooks somehow created a new company instead! the support for backing up the company’s data is all over the place, since there are so many variants of the softwareapp.
you get what you pay for (sometimes not even!). you can't do much with the ipad version except create and receive invoices. i had debated leaving easy books for this, thinking it would have more professional features, but it actually has fewer.
. good app!
great. good apps
zero stars 10.3 is junk. i used this app several times a day. i run my business on this app. since april 10th i cannot access my data. my business is suffering and intuit cannot fix it. i still have to pay. tech support at intuit  quickbooks recommended i switch to a android. (i doesn't work on my iphone or ipad) i really do not want to invest in new hardware. stay away from intuit they do not care and offer no solutions.
simple to use on the go.. really liking how simple it is to use & track things.
just started. i just started my business and only had a few transactions. when i downloaded qb online it was simple and everything reconciled perfectly. it's easier then the old software too which i am use to using.
the best. this app is the best for my businnes, when i use him as a contractor is the best, because i never lost money or forget charge any work. i love it.
almost perfect. please add the ability to print or download packing slips from the mobile app. everything else can wait till i am back in the office. sometimes a packing slip must be done in a rush. mobile app is useless to me without the packing slip feature.
. love the app
business made easy. use this app daily keeps everything organized
never has worked on my s7 edge. i loved this app when it worked with my htc. since i switched to this phone, it keeps giving me an error message and despite talking with support multiple times, nothing has been done to resolve this. i have uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times and it has not resolved the problem. i have seen similar issues reported with this phone.
customer service is great.. had a little trouble setting up called customer service and they got me up and running.
great app. it good for all your on the go payments and keeps it in order.
crashes 48 times per day. app crashes over and over, saying you need to log in again for critical updates. there are no updates availability, and deleting and reinstalling the app doesn’t help. it’s frustrating because it takes 20 minutes to enter customer information, because you need to finish and hit that save button before the next crash. best to just use quickbooks in the browser, even though that isn’t perfect. four stars with no crashes.
. propaganda enganosa falava qu e o aplicativo estava media de 13 reais fiz a assinatura sem o primeiro mês de teste já quererem cobrar quase 49 reais não quero isso por favor cancele. além de não dar para usar um aplicativo tão complicado agora anuncia um valor barato depois cobra mais de 3 vezes esse valor. cancele não quero. nem usei. instalei hoje e já estou desinstalando.
it's okay. i like the ability to send invoices from the app. however a balance sheet or bank balance view is really necessary for anyone who truly manages their company.
. good app need a few obvious corrections but will be well worth the money when there are fixed
stable. no longer crashes. the first update into ios 10.0.2 was really bad. wouldn't load. this update fixes that issue and i'm back working. was a setback for a week as i do a lot of invoice updates through the app, but i made due.
". 6.10.19  i hate it. you can't do ""billable"" expenses from the app. you cant edit invoices that have been sent. terrible. i hate it. 8.12.19  still hate it. noone has ""investigated""my situation. 👎👎 12.5.19. yup.. still hate it. i use it but cringe every single time i open it. pos app. zero stars"
. love this app, keeps track of all my expenses and payments from clients. easiest way to do estimates and invoices as well.
. this app on android wont even open. i have the apple version and it works fine. i just keeps saying its stopped working....
useless. app is slow and hard to use.
app lacks functionality. info being offered isn't current 2017 information. try looking up purchase orders per vendor and it displays last years (2016) scattered information. not very useful... this app is only good for sales invoices and p&l reports. that's about it. and who's to say that stuff is even current without double checking with the online database from your computer. payments: unreliable looks like i'm sticking with the gopayment app. just another step to my day to day book keeping tasks...
easy to use. look, read a lot of the reviews and people are expecting their own accountant with this program. it does what is needed to keep your finances in order. if you want 4 ,ill ion graphs to impress and be bigger then you are....go hire a team. great product, easy to use, tracks everything for me, keep my books straight, and recommend it to everyone.
. if i could give it a half star i would. i have a customer who paid me a week ago through my invoice and it still hasn't reached my account how can i run my business if my money wont be put into my account?
many issues.... most of the time they come up with an update it does not work well after we update the app. they should test this updates before releasing it.
. this app no longer works. i cannot make invoices, sales receipts, etc. i called quickbooks and they said there is nothing they could do. i have a mobile business and relied on this app, now it's useless.
great app. very nice and good
. we still can't check bank account balances. tons of missing features.
um yeeaaa.... it’s kind of crappy i can’t link my bank accounts with out manually entering the transaction it kinda takes the quick out of quickbooks
better than sage. with a properly functioning mobile app, square integration & receiptexpense management, 10 times easier to use than sage(simply accounting)
great functionality across platforms. i use qbo to do estimates and invoicing on a laptop, ipad and iphone. i occasionally swipe a credit card too and they all perform very well. little bit presentation on each device but they all work!
. finally, this app is getting better! i have just quickly looked at it but the difference is very noticeable. goid things come to those that wait.
. the app freezes frequently. when it's not freezing, it's too slow.
great app!. at first, i thought that this app was pretty clunky and i didn't enjoy using it. in the last couple of years or so, it has gotten considerably better. i really like using it now.
can’t enter bills. totally useless
good app, but could be better. the app is good but could be better with more functionality. for example not being able to add 'bills' but you can add 'expenses' a small change but would make the app much better.
does not work on 3g. i am unable to use quickbooks over a cellular connection. this has been the case since ios 9. sometimes after certain qb updates it works, then others it won't. i will be making notes of the versions when this issue occurs.
very convenient. app is great when you are not in your office.
subscription errors. nothing but problems since january. i switched from the download to the app so i could do it at home and it's been nothing but problems, and not even the same ones!!! i have 2 companies, it's june, and i'm still trying to get this straightened out to input this years data.
. great app, much easier to invoice customers.
great program.. it's easy to use either in the pc or mobile.
5050. good tool but it's slow in the network and chews threw battery.
this app does not function properly on ios13. i cannot view any customer files. i can search for them, but the app will not let me click on a customer to edit invoices.
pretty good. i've been using qb for years to run my small auto repair business. the latest qbo and phone app are pretty good. like the interface. easy to use. only complaint is if i have no internet connection i'm dead in the water. being mobile is occasionally an issue.
best app for start up company. hands down this app is the best for any size company, once its all set and customized to your company you & your employees will operate more efficiently. take your time to learn it don't be afraid to call customer service they are very friendly and helpful.
doesn't sync. app doesn't sync with qb, banking features (adding expenses, vendors) also doesn't sync with online site.
"is anyone home?. i give this app one star because it doesn't let you select zero stars! all i've gotten for three days is an endless loop telling me that""to use this app you need quickbooks online"". no kidding? i'd love to find some of the application problems some of you are complaining about. at least you can turn yours on!"
. great app. very helpful.
. i've been trying to use this app for months and months. it doesnt work, and nobody has done anything about the problems even though there are numerous complaints and bad reviews. i'm getting ready to stop paying for quickbooks and find something else. i mainly wanted to us the app for taking pictures of receipts, but due to the syncing issues, i can't submit more than one receipt picture without the app hanging or freezing. i've tried reinstalling, clearing cache, etc. with no luck.
mobile office. app works wonderfully makes life easy on the go for mobile office. keep up the good work!!!
. this app isn't ready for primetime. used to work better. the reconciliation doesn't work if you need to hit the back button on any transaction no matter how many you approve before it. completely frustrating and gets worse with time.
"mostly useful. i like having access to my business via my smartphone, however not all features are available (reports) and some calculations don't seem to work properly. after adding payment for clients, the invoices entered afterward are not automatically attached to said payment  even though the overall balance on the account is recalculated. the invoices sit and show as ""unpaid"" even though the account balance is at zero."
great app. the app takes a bit to get used to but once you've played with it a bit it's very simple to navigate, update bank transactions and so on
simple but robust.. with a great user interface connecting with the larger data and programme, i’m impressed by the elegant and obviously intentional design. when i look at my phone, i’m looking at exactly the kind of information that i would need on the go. very good design work by these guys.
. makes my whole world a million times faster and easier. thank you quick books from me and my family
not easy to use. simple tasks like entering a transaction are complex. app and online qb have a slow response when tapping things. just overall frustrating trying to switch from desktop qb to the app and online qb.
omg. if you don't have it you are missing out. this is the easiest and most helpful app ever.
"yay...it's working again!!. qbs has been quite efficient and easy to use! i appreciate like the constant improvements!! however, note to developer...i wish this app gave ""real time"" remindsnotices of when to bill a client based on days, just to make it more customized???!? maybe add a calendar with an to synchronize with the personalipad calendars??? i down know, i just find myself calculating day for my customized client each time, instead of just getting a notification. thank, still love this app!!!"
the best business app ever!. i have been in business for nine years and have been using quickbooks desktop. i am now using the online and it is great so happy that i made the switch. works well with ipad and can do my work right on the site! thanks for the great work! ray's home improvement,llc
fix finally now i can get back to work.. this version fixed the errors from the last update. glad it working again. quickbooks has been good except the last update. this one fixed the issue. we us this app for our onsite business and it's great. several times i would send an invoice to the customer when i'm leaving their home and before i get to the next job it's already paid. update. does not work again. :(
love it. my entire business is conducted through my iphone. thanks qb for making life so easy!!! greatest app for any small business, hands down!!!
. horrible, did not notify of subscription issue. data entered not commited to database. double charged my credit card. terrible customer service (james refusing a last name or initial from customer care) experience, nothing resolved. no response from error logs. called and even gave control of my computer. never did intuit offer any fix. ongoing issues over 6 months damaging my business.
cis. 3 stars given because i can barely use the app to submit cis invoices as i have to use the webpage version which does not work very well at all on a mobile interface
. great software and service for small companies
best addition for any business on the go!. the free trial was amazing. my favorite part is having the ability to send invoices. while setting up my merchant services, customer support was kind and easy to work with. now it's easier to bill my clients from my phone. i track everything. get the quickbooks app. you won't regret it!
disappointed. i work a lot with the browser version of qbo which is really excellent. unfortunately, the ipad version is far from good... when we talk about cloudconnected application, i expect to have the same functionalities whatever is the system used. wrong design...
excellent app. ease the booking... awesome
qbo app. great to know i can do invoices etc on the go.
gary stanton. this app means i can seem to know what i am doing, it actually works for me.
why!?!. this app and online program is insanely buggy. every time i try and open the app it takes five or six trys before it loads. once it loads i am satisfied at best with the user experience, but if my internet connection isn't a gig a second the app crashes. i wish i didn't pay for a years worth of service or i would delete it with extreme prejudice.
crashes. crashes immediately after i open the application. update was recently done and now i can't use it.
. love it kindly introduce an app for the managers too. which shows reports.
very convenient!. this app has saved me on so many occasions. being able sending invoices and estimates onthego is awesome.
. love the app. really helps making estimates and sending email to customers. it can also keep up with profit and loss but i haven't been using it. habit of doing it myself
. excellat ap this app is great. keeps me informed even when i am out in the field. i love it.
best mobile accounting app. great improvements in the latest version. easily the best ipadiphone app for accounting, that sits well alongside the full featured qbo software.
crash. latest update causes app to crash on loading.
mgrm. great app. useful and easy to use.
discussed. app would not download after several tries.
good app. .
. simple to navigate
. it doesn't get any better than this!
keep having to uninreinstall. i keep having to uninstall app then reinstall because it gives me a black screen, then closes out. this is the 2nd time i’ve had to do this and it appears it may be a bug of sorts. overall happy with the app but please fix this glitch.
app as of lately. every time  every single time  i open app, it tells me it must log out because it’s running critical updates. it worked fine until a week ago. not sure if it’s related to apple software but it’s getting old.
. awful. go through the web browser instead. the app doesn't connect frequently, saying the program is offline, but i can connect through the browser with no problems.
best app for start up company. hands down this app is the best for any size company, once its all set and customized to your company you & your employees will operate more efficiently. take your time to learn it don't be afraid to call customer service they are very friendly and helpful.
ios 13 and later app crashes. the app works well prior to ios 13.0 when opened in an iphone running ios 13 later, the app crashes after faceid login.
. almost 2 weeks now the app has not been working. the dashboard is just totally blank. im having to take a toptop to work and tether off my phone.
. i thought it was bad three years ago! its much worse now. not user friendly and still doesnt support my form of business. all they really do with this app is track your bank account and catigorise things. you can only catigorise as an expense or income. its the new year and new month and its counting transaction from jan 2019 as transactions from december 2018. i need help. any recomendations on business softwesr that also has tax softwear?
great app. i am running a smal business llc for a tattoo parlor, great app for even simple tasks. definitely worth the money, and i wouldn't use anything else.
. it is really user friendly.
. great app for seeing your accounts and any overdue payments. i only use for reference because i put all my input on the quick books on the computer
. if you're used to the desktop version the transition to online is seemless and eases the file share process with yout accountant. i highly recommend for a small business
i can't look up pertinent information. i can't look up pertinent information on the go while i am meeting with clients, such as a yearly sales history. doesn't do much good for the small business owner. definitely not worth paying so much money for an app that has no functionality in the field.
. overall it's a good app. just a few things i'd change.
can invoice from anywhere. i can start invoices at the gym and finish them at the office ! no longer putting things off and forgetting about them we love it!
. great app and easy to use!
crashing in on the reliable. overall not a great product  i actually do enjoy quickbooks online. but this app is just atrocious. history improve in so many ways just to get one more star out of me
. always problems connecting to my bank tsb in the uk. and i'm paying for this service... there's potential for it to be a great app though if it worked.
. problem in sigin to app
reports. would be nice if app could run reports. hopefully more robust in the future.
. this app is great for being on the go. love it!
doesn't work. app isn't working with lg g5 with android.6.0.1. won't let me login.
love this app!. this has solved my issue of remembering to create invoices after the service. so far i am loving this app :)
. like the app just struggling to get the logo in the est and inv struggle on the mobile
pace trailer repair. qbo
convenient app. fast and easy way to update my account plus banking syncable
progressive payments. love the accessibility and simpleness of creating invoices. would love to see progressive invoicing added to quickbooks online
qb. completely unusable since 6th september update. crashes all the time on latest ios please fix this.
app crashes on ios 9 and ios 10. when i click on support it takes you to a web page that also does not work properly. do you have email support ?
won't connect to qb online since update.. i've been using qb for ipad with few issues to date, until the latest update. now, i'm on a job, trying to invoice a customer and can not since the app will not connect to qb online.
worth the buy!!!!. quickbooks mobile has made estimates and invoicing so much easier! definitely with the buy for any small business!
👌🏼. not a bad app
. this app is missing some very important things like deposits and time entry.
app needs help. great desktop program. the app needs to be able to track mileage and time on a job. that's really my only complaint the more i use it the more i like it
. great app! i use this to manage my small business information.
q books. i love this app it's very useful
. good app, simple and yet very decent would give 5 stars but the hardware android menu button doesn't do anything. set it to open that side bar, also it needs a speed increase. sometimes it takes over 40 seconds to update. otherwise great app, easy to use. eagerly await updates to this.
easy and super user friendly. first time user of this type of app but it was easy to set up. sent out my first invoice after 1hr already.
good stuff. the phone app is a good resource that compliments the desktop app. i have been using qb online for several years and have found that it meets my business needs as a small consulting company with less than 10 employees.
very helpful. haven't had any problems with this.
fab. brilliant app that updates instantly, giving a visual handle on your business at any time. thank you
quicbooks is just plain lame. absolutely ridiculous how one cannot add extra fields in invoicing. support is full of excuses claiming things will be fixed and never goes anywhere. then got message that everything from qbse would have to be migrated to their more comprehensive (read expensive) package... basically just a trap.
. makes my job easier.
. i like it compared to the desktop program, i wish it had more functionality that the desktop has. i have been finding work around to get what i want done but not able to do everything like i expected. but i love being able to work in the field
completely useless. i have no idea how this app has a 4.7. you cant even edit transactions within this app. the worst part is that the website is completely broken on an ipad pro. together this makes quick books online completely unusable without a laptop. absolute garbage.
unable to see expenses as anything other than cash. even if i input it on my computer as credit card and i save it as such, on the app, it'll say cash. can't change it either
quickbooks online on macbook. quickbooks online is constantly crashing while i'm creating my invoices. every time i enter a line entry i have to take the extra time to save it because the program will freeze up and i will have to force quit and restart the whole invoice over again. i rate it a 1 star only because i can't rate it any lower.
great app. easy to use and getting better every update
this works for me.... i have a hard time keeping up with my invoices but this makes it simple for me to keep track on the move or like right now laying in my bed creating invoices and estimates. this is great.
awesome app.. make business on the run fast secure and simple. thanks quickbooks
