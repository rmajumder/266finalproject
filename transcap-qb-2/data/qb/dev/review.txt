only a trial. would have been nice to know it was a trial only, i saw the in app purchase option but no where did it say trial.
quickbooks app is a perfect companion to quickbooks online. quickbooks app is a perfect companion to quickbooks online. it works seamlessly allowing you to read through your transactions and even create most of the common tasks. ( with the exception of vat tasks) qb online is the perfect accounts program
never has worked on my s7 edge. i loved this app when it worked with my htc. since i switched to this phone, it keeps giving me an error message and despite talking with support multiple times, nothing has been done to resolve this. i have uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times and it has not resolved the problem. i have seen similar issues reported with this phone.
. stupid app crashs more often as than works
excellent. wonderful app to use. very handy when working out in the field. easy to get on the phone with a live person for any and all questions.
agree with useless. not what i expected. does not have the same functions as qbo. disappointed! would have been great and convenient if all functions were available.
customer search bar is gone. i can’t search for clients when i’m in the app. now i have to search and click in the left letters to get close to their name. i’m not able to search by phone number either. i’m very disappointed they made this change
since last update app is glitchy. usually this app works great but since last update it has a couple glaring glitches that make it less then desirable to use.
will not let me access my info!!!. ever since i got new phones for my technicians ,samsung s5, i have not been able to access any of my customers, transactions, or invoices. i use qbo for my business, but have now lost all mobile capabilities. if not resolved, i will be forced to use a different accounting software. 5 stars if working properly.
easy and it works!. simple, yeah!
. make sure you know what services they provide, as customer support likely knows less than you do.
best app!. best app better then squared
qbooks online. the windows version is pretty decent but the mobile app is horrible. the invoicing option is not that great. i give it 2 star just because it is accessible from every where.
works well but can’t see inventory level in app. would be helpful if i could check inventory levels without going to web, other than that pretty handy app
. game changer! i've only had it downloaded for 5 minutes and i love it! i will change this review, if any hiccups change my mind, after further use.
great small business tool. great for sending invoices, tracking due invoices, and emailing with document or pic attachments. cut out a good deal of my paperwork.
took out deposit option! why?. i can no longer record simple deposits from the mobile app. i’ve been using quickbooks online for over a year now and make use of that functionality weekly. why did they take it away? not every deposit is an invoice payment.
. app crashes a lot. several times after updates are made to the app it will crash after i have to sign in again. now it just crashes after i try to sign in.
quickbooks online. great app. saves having to cart round invoice pads.
owner. i have been quite impressed! small owneroperator, able to send invoices, estimates, et al. from my trucklove it!
flawed. i am going to reinstall the old app. the new app will not allow me to add a customer from my phone's contact list.
new business.. very user friendly. almost like apple designed it. very unhappy that the email function doesn’t work. many people have complained for over a year and quickbooks still hasn’t offered a fix😠. i have to take a screenshot and copy and paste to my email. not as professional looking, but gets the job done. that one glitch took away two stars because i can’t use my mobile phone to give someone an invoice or estimate.
"is anyone home?. i give this app one star because it doesn't let you select zero stars! all i've gotten for three days is an endless loop telling me that""to use this app you need quickbooks online"". no kidding? i'd love to find some of the application problems some of you are complaining about. at least you can turn yours on!"
. this website is terrible and the customer service is friendly yet not helpful!!! i want to cancel my subscription and yet told to remove the app from my tablet....wrong by removing the app it does not cancel my subscription...very unhappy!!
i like it. i have enjoyed using this app for the last year. i am blind and it is 99% accessible with my screen reader, voiceover. i only want to report one error. the last update causes the app to crash when trying to edit an expense entry my accountant manages my quickbooks online account, however, when i find an incorrect category has been applied, i cannot fix it. the app crashes when i attempt
quickbooks. excellent app, works great for my business.
. if i invoice a client and they mail check or hand me a check or give me cash i cannot record income unless they pay online bank transfer or credit card. so i cannot accurately. so this app is useless. and horrible client management. also need to be online no offline input. also i cannot merge to qb app each charge 9.99 month. cannot merge date as qb has better customer tracking. also neefs time tracking for jobs
slow and buggy. disappointed in app. doesn't correlate well with desktop version. slow to load information and sometimes won't update accounts.
simply the best. so simple to use and makes more time free for myself
. useless app. can't integrate one of the biggest bank of australia (cba) with this app. support is just forwarding issue from one team to other. wated almost one hour on the phone. solution is to forward the issue to next level. there are three companies under my account with same name. cannot delete company. how app allow to create three identical names?? wast of time and money.
. i use it to attach photos to my transactions.
qb app. great to have this access.and it works !
. terrible, ended up deleting it. so buggy that you can't save expenses.
. the app is good. they can still work on some parts to make user experience better.
great app. this is getting better with each update it makes. i you this app everyday to run my practice and it makes it very convenient because i'm constantly on the road and i don't have to sit at my desk just to enter expenses or send invoices to clients.
pretty lame. seriously? the thing crashes a lot , but i can deal with that. the real problem for me is the lack of calendar in the invoice line item. i would love to use this, but if i can't put the date that i provided a service in my invoice, the it is useless to me. too bad safari doesn't work either, or i would just use that.
latest update. the last update has the photo settings all messed up. you can no longer capture a good picture that will send with invoices. it either won’t attach to the invoice or it’s cropped automatically to the point the entire page doesn’t show. needs to be fixed. already looking at other options for my business.
. very user friendly!
crashes!. just crashes every time on ios 13
not suitable. not happy with this app and it won't let me cancel it! help!
. super customer service!
disappointment. tried signing in several times. tried resetting password 4 times. tried uninstalling and reinstalling, twice. only thing that works is uninstalling for good.
waste of valuable time.. all i wanted was a simple app to send 1 (one) out of state customer an invoice at the end of the month. my other 2 (two) customers don't really need one. took an hour to set it up and a couple more to figure out i was declined. just wanted something simple.
great for dummies. wife told me i had to get more organized with my billing. i went down kicking and screaming but she was right!! program works great on my phone and ipad. super easy to use.
. i cant connect my bank account, or contaxt support for help, waste of money. not the service i payed for, avoid
qb app !!!. love the app ! now with the new update i can log in with touch id :))) how fan, and saving much time.
business on the run. quickbooks online with the ios app make operating a travel based business on the run simple. log invoices as you go. input estimates along the way. print and mail or email all at once at the end of the day. not to mention the helpful reports and expense management. i couldn't run my business without it.
ceo of gd2k. this is a really good app it has help our business in so many ways. it help boost our profit margin we have been able to close deals, and make invoices right on the spot. i recommend this for a lot of different business with quickbooks online.
. as an business owner best and very useful application. thank you quickbook
i can’t do payroll from the app. it works great and is much improved from the original versions but i do not have a desktoplaptop pc........ only ipads and android phones and the apps limits my access way to much i currently use the chrome browser but it’s horrible only part of the screen is visible on the ipad some save buttons can not be accessed thanks for your help
doesn't work. every time (every single time) i try to use the app (on my galaxy s7), it throws an error. it has never worked one time. i login and it throws an error.
slow and buggy. disappointed in app. doesn't correlate well with desktop version. slow to load information and sometimes won't update accounts.
. simple and easy to use
. great app
so glitchy!! 😡. quickbooks has the potential to be great. but this app is so, so glitchy! have constant problems with it and i'm really getting to the point of giving up and going back to sage. every time a problem is sorted, a new one pops straight back up. if they could employ some decent tech guys and get things working properly, this would be brilliant.
. as a sole proprietor it is great to work this app .
great app. easy and very intuitive.
. concept was good. but too many errors. could not work at all
wow!. really cool app! it's linked on all my device! i can make invoices on my phone and send it to my clients directly from email! cool stuff!
can't do much. you can't pay bills, enter bills, or do almost anything that i do on a daily basis on my computer. the app is nice looking but useless for anything i need to do besides check my balance.
latest version is a disaster. face recognition does not work at all. you have to sign in every time you open the app and often get kicked out especially when switching between companies. colossal waste of time.
. absolutely awful and useless in every single way. beyond awful and useless. everything is hard to do. everything takes forever to get done. it always crashes and has constant glitches.
. update: no longer freezes but is now saving estimates and invoices multiple time and showing 70k extra in income from invoices and bank deposits which it's now not allowing us to match payments with invoices so our only current option is to delete all duplicate payments and have customers outstanding balances until this is fixed
. how long has this app been out and it still doesn't work? i can update my bank feeds just fine on the website and pc version but the android app always errors out. clearing cache or reinstalling won't help. i get the same error on my phone and tablet. on my other tablet it just crashes to home screen completely. why am i paying for this again??
. clunky, ugly app with barely any features. there's no way to refresh your banking data within the app, though navigation and ux is so awful i maybe just can't find it. no consistent design standard throughout with multiple different menu types, navigation styles, presentation. almost no graphics, just pages of text. invoicing, expenses and tracking are all so horrible i'm forced to use the (also underwhelming) browser version. how did this pass quality control?
great app. this app is great and it supports an even greater cloudbased accounting programme, i wish i had started to use it sooner. it is making my life so much easier.
. this is a very user friendly app. i can modify and create estimatesinvoices on the fly! good work intuit!
disappointed. i just switched from my trusty iphone to an android phone, this app on my iphone was perfect! it had a list of products and services, unlike the android version. it also loaded all the estimates and invoices for all my customers, this android version hardly has any of my past transactions! please make this like the ios app!
nice app!. i live on my device  from research to book keeping. elegant style and useful! i can do almost everything from my note 2! light years beyond the old quick books that i used 10 years ago! i'm sending invoices in minutes. awesome! update: still a great app on my nexus 6!
crashes, not usable, nexus 5x. crashes and no longer usable on a stock nexus 5x on android 6.0.1. app is now useless to me on my phone which is a major problem.
it is very easy to use. the app may not have the power or flexibility of the web client, or pc installed application, but it works well and is very easy to use.
great tool. its great tool for small business. makes my life easier. recommend
. account function is good . but technical support & help customer service is poor, not responding. wrost app
returning to qb. uk staff still rude and unhelpful.
this is amazing. app gets better all the time. and i getpaid faster with the easy to use app. thank qb
convenient. can enter sales receipts and expenses into quick books away from the office. that's a useful add on to their online program.
very limited. don't expect to come close to the alreadylimited function set of the desktopbrowser version. a real disappointment.
app
great when it works. i rely heavily on this especially the ability to email an invoice. lately i can't log in at all and when i do and try to send an email, all it does is give me a spinning wheel and then locks up. then i have to shut off the phone and restart.
. i have had this app for my business for about 1 year. every time i spent the money new transection comes up 2 time . and it's too hard to remove on transection.
been perfect for my business. qb has helped keep me organized and professional while growing my agency. expect for minor tech glitches which are minor inconvenience it's been a perfect tool!
". wow, fell for it again. still listed as free, yet is payware. my bad. free download does not make it free. older version: not free as advertised. 30 day cinderella ware. fine, but they should clearly state that. i was impressed until after setup they informed me. my bad; l should know better. their advertising says it's good tho. uninstalled b4 review. ""while it isnt free"" it said it was free."
. amazing app . makes my business bookkeeper free. defo recommend
portable. great app for running a business on the road. i wish it had progressive invoicing....but overall i am happy.
great app. love it real simple to use!!!
wow. not ready for prime time. i don't think this has followed through on a single promise it is horribly clunky at importing bank transactions  count on spending hours recategorizing every single transaction you made honestly. it's barely better than a spreadsheet for the price
. this software has made it possible for me to run a business having no prior experience, and not really being good at budgeting personally. recommend it at the drop of a hat.
request. how can i easily find the last price charged to the customer on a specific item?
. i have just started my own small business and this programapp is great and easy too use
great app. best way to get you paid and look professional.. quickbooks thanks for making it so easy for me to get my business going. very convenient and efficient.
. good app. have a few things i would like to see added. i have made suggestions and am sure they will accommodate in due course. makes me more efficient. have come to rely on app and would have otto spend a lot more time on data entry and research without it.
no supplier invoice. invoices from suppliers can not be captured on the app. you have to log onto the main website  which is extremely slow and cluttered to navigate on a mobile phone.
terrible terrible service. i was under the impression that this was designed to make accounting easier for small businesses. emails asking to upgrade with special offers open you new accounts! no option to snap receipts and have them automatically added in essential package which was the main reason we chose it.
nice but crashes. i like the app other than the fact that after a few minutes of work it crashes. it reliably crashes. helpfully they fix it soon, it's frustrating to have to log back in every time.
indispensable. as a mobile tutor, and entrepreneur  recent business owner, this app more than pays for itself in the value it brings. i'm always on the go it seems, and my business comes with. makes accounting, etc a breeze!!!
the app is wonderful. quickbooks online itself is lacking in a few features that i would like, such as work orders and job costing. the app is well done though.
highly recommend for startups. qbo does everything that i need it to. it is a great dashboard to see where i am at, with the ability to add details to all of my transactions.
great app. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😊😊
. cancelling your subscription seems impossible. i've emailed, called, used their help menu. it shouldn't be this hard. still trying to cancel.
statements. wish i could send statements from the app. i do love the convenience of the app!
broken update. your update broke the app.
very solid app.. a couple gripes, but overall great user experience.
3 year user.. lots of glitches. signs me out within seconds of logging in and there’s many steps just to put items into an invoice or receipt.
broken after update. not updating customer data, crashing, please fix it, i have a business to run!
poor. need to put password in every time i start can't write a service invoice and an amount
ipad perfect until ios 8.5. app hasn't worked since 8.5 update. have sent several request about the app crashing and no one has gotten back to me. i've deleted and redone loaded, rebooted ipad, etc. when not crashing it's a 5 star app. please fix asap!
unable to login via iphoneipad. every time i try and login from my iphone or ipad it tells me no account associated with the given information. but when i login via a web browser with the exact same information i have no problem. basically defeating the purpose of the app. fix asap please
need options to customize invoices. please add more options to customize invoices. i need to add secondary contact information such as name, address and phone, along with the regular billing address. also, i would like to modify the invoice number. otherwise, this app is great for field use with my ipad+cellular. it has saved me tons of time compared with working on my laptop and quickbooks desktop.
. working great, really makes it simple
i’m loving quickbooks. quickbooks makes life so much easier! thank you so much!
". updating my review since the login issue has been fixed. the quickbooks app it has been very useful for my mobile business. i'm glad to see they finally made where i can attach pdf documents to the invoice. the only thing i i would like to see updated is when the customer signs the invoice it currently just shows their signature, i would like it to say ""signed by:"" and even be able to type their name as signatures are virtually impossible to read."
upload receipts feature. snap on mobile new feature saves lots of time as well the ability to drag and drop files or emailing receipts work well and helps expedite petty cash procedures. excellent addition to quickbooks online!!
. great app. i wish it could link to the desk top version. i use it primarily for invoicing on the go but the bookkeeper uses the desk top version.
. would give it 5* if i could see the summary view on the app (similar to the web version). i wish it could do everything that the desktop version could do, but i know that isn't always possible. *edit jan 2019* love the summary view, the app rocks
very good for any kind of business!. quickbooks is great app for managing the everyday finances. it's very fast to send invoices, with this app all income and expenses are simple and quick.
update google signin never works. update: quickbooks support contacted me. i uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it works now.  i have tried and tried to get into the quickbooks app using the google signin. i get it to work maybe 1 out of every 50 times i try to login. i don't know why they haven't fixed this issue yet. i always end up logging in on my mobile browser instead. fail
crash error crash error. quickbooks is a four outta five platform, this app is a one... signs me out and crashes more than once a day!
great app. excellent app, does exactly what i need with no fuss
app is limited on what your can do. the app would be more helpful if i could categorize transactions while on the go among many other features the desktop version offers.
best i've used.. not the most expensive i've tried but by far the easiest. takes minutes to send an instant invoice. 1010 from me.
excellent mix of features, convenience, affordability. provides an excellent combination of easy to use features and convenience for use on mobile devices. software and features are updated regularly. one of the best solutions out there. the only reason i've withheld one star is i'd like to see more affordable packages
poor design. very hard to navigate and understand. customer service only works bankers hours and not when you need them.
software de gestão. excelente e rápido! me ajuda muito! parabéns! pequenas coisas precisam de ajuste mas que não atrapalham em nada. podem usar!
. love the qbo app for small businesses. so much that can be done quickly.
". not free as advertised. 30 day cinderella ware. fine, but they should clearly state that. i was impressed until after setup they informed me. my bad; l should know better. their advertising says it's good tho. uninstalled b4 review. ""while it isnt free"" it said it was free."
. fast and efficient. but some delays from computer to app.
great app for small business!. i love being able to enter my expenses and invoices from my phone. very convenient and makes tax time much easier!
don't do it. can't bill a portion of a estimate have to bill it all at once! it will not let you see your job costs per estimate! this is a huge deal i can't believe they haven't fixed this yet. come on qb add another freaken column already! tones of other stuff on the accounting side that i don't know about is missing as well!
. best small business app around
a & e blue dreams inc.. excellent app. i like it....
"cumbersome. cumbersome and clunky to deal with. constantly checking to make sure i'm not a robot. security is appreciated but this is ridiculous and really slows me down. used to be good but got updatedtweaked""improved"" past the point of being useful. now i dread having to use it."
i love this app. i love all of the features it currently has. i wish we had more of the controls we had from our qbo web version. 4616  i love that i can now see my check registers & a few other things have been updated. added the final star!
can't attach images or accept signatures. really!!?? so many features i would have expected. track expenses, milage, accept signatures.
. invoices can't add cost except discounts to my invoices using my s4 phone.
impressive for mobile. i posted a bad review because of some bugs. i received an immediate response about upcoming updates and a week later it was fixed. i love that level of support. nice app too.
awesome app. this app really helps me keep track of all my transactions for my pool business. easy to use and has everything i need.
. garbage, won't let you delete your account. it took hours to finally be able to delete email and account, save yourself the hassle and dont download it.
worth the price. i am a small business owner, i was having to write out estimates and bills but since i have this app....... life is way easier!!! now i have more time to do the work and less hassle with the paperwork.
. this is by far the best accounting apps i have ever used on all of my devices. freaking awesome!
presently surprised. i really did not want to move away from the desktop version i purchased, back when that was a thing. however, i am really enjoying being able to create invoices, collect payments, etc. while on the go. so i suppose i will get used to this payasyougo thing ;)
nice. nice app but when you have to select item then you have to type whole item code, before update you just type last 23 words and it's there.
no problems. just a decent easy tool for your business which will save on time and money. can’t complain!!
crashes since ios13. i can no longer open my quickbooks on my phone since the ios 13 update has been released.
fix it!!!!!!!!. when it works i like it, but when it flips out it is so frustrating. every time they update it it takes another couple updates to fix it. leave well enough alone!
useless  data download errors. the app worked great for the past couple years and now all the sudden it keeps crashing when trying to download my data. i own a mobile business and now i'm having to preplan and print invoices before i show up because the app is useless.
app doesn’t open. app doesn’t open on the new iphone pro
missing functionality. reliable app but authentication is too slow. also some features aren't available. i sometimes just use the web app through the browser to access those features.
a great experience. this new update has just all the features required from this app and more. not just do you guys listen but act as well. kudos. the best cloud service, that can be.
senior pastor. excellent app
easy to use. i've used different programs and by far, quickbooks has been the easiest to use
everything worked great until last update.. can't save invoices. have to login every time using password. payments don't apply to the invoices just to name a few. wish i hadn't updated.
junk  plagued with issues. this is is great when it works, but is plagued with bugs. as of recently it logs me out to “refresh,” then when i log back it it tells me the account doesn’t exist. i fix this i have to delete the app and reinstall it, every, single, time. and their customer service is terrible. they never have any solutions.
convenience is nice. nice to be able to access clients remotely and get most information. would be nice to have full functionality in app. some functions are slow going from screen to screen.
keeps crashing. i am trying to use this app on my s7 on sprint. everytime i log in it crashes and ask to send crash report. ive installed it a few times now. please fix bug.
happy. works well. as intended. nice to be able to rectify transactions on the go.
very easy and intuitive. i love how easy quickbooks online makes it the keep up with my invoicing and expenses. whether its on my phone or on the computer i can quickly and easily get the business part out of the way so i can get back to what i love to do.
great app. been with quickbooks for two years now and still really impressed very easy to use and works across all platforms would strongly recommend
awesome app. this is a brilliant app. i have all my invoices and expenses at my fingertips. very easy to use and synchs perfectly with qbo on my mac. keeps me on track with daily reminders of overdue invoices. no one gets away with not paying me now.
. love it so easy to navigate
lacks functionality. i used to use a desktop version and wish i hadn't switched. i can't easily add interest to late payments, can't track vendor insurance expirations. doesn't seem like much to ask.
refund made impossible. i’ve been making payment on this stupid app not using it at all. there’s no easy way to refund or unsubscribe this stupid app. who do i bring the attention to since quickbook site says they have nothing to do with the billing and subscription?
best app ever. just wanted to thank the development team for helping me to manage my business easier with this app.
it's gotten a smidgen better. i want to be able to edit deposits and click on numbers in the reports to see details and edit things.
. quickbooks is great. i've been using it for a few years. customers can pay directly through their email and it makes keeping track of sales and expenses very easy.
overdue but great! gorgeous!. this app is way, way overdue, but at least they got it right the first time around. no it doesn't do everything the website does, but nailed, adding buttons (functionality) is the easy part. it's definitely one of the best looking apps on my ipad.
excellent on the go apps  for small business. easy to navigate .
. good app, needs to have more functionality, less clicks to use and needs auto log in
unclear and sneaky. nowhere in the app did it say that i needed a different product if i’m selfemployed. so i signed up and paid for my first month without knowing that it wasn’t the right one. i’ve paid double the amount i needed to and not even used it and never will use it. a waste of money. not happy at all.
. software works ok and only ok. however the monthly price seems to have gone up exponentially for no reason over the last 2 years. edit: changed from 3 stars to 1 star thanks to the developer's response.
. great app for the on the go contractor. i can invoice, send a receipt from anywhere.
excellent update!. thanks very much for the update, all my recent activity imported and the reports are very much welcomed! this has definitely made me happy. cheers!
app. great
review. happy with qb is working for me just need to work out how to link my bank in and do my accounts on it this should be simple but l am no wizard on tec. the code that l am ask for from my bank is not linking and not sure why. but so fare it's good.
service after the sale is nonexistant!. i’ve been trying to get incorrect billing corrected for almost a month now. customer service directs me to my sales rep and the sales rep no longer responds to emails from me or his coworkers in customer service. try waveapps...it seems to be comparable to the simple start plan and it’s free!
. the app works but doesn't seem to pull data quickly even over wifi or 4g
awesome job on the ipad app!. really needed this app for quickbooks to keep me mobile. i needed to use quickbooks online but was unable to use my ipad for quickbooks now i can! keep up with the tweaks but i love it!
horrible app!!!. online service seems to work good but use my phone a lot on the go!!! can't do any billing from app anymore!!! really hurting disappointed!!!! who do you talk to about this!!!! i give the app no stars
qbo app. useless app, does not present a desirable layout compared to the the online version, in the banking area, to the bank register. somewhat comparable to using another account program.
really useful. great app allowing me to raise invoices whilst on site, confirm details with clients and syncs with the software back at the office.
awesome app. i waited to rate this app because i knew eventually everything was going to be available on the mobile app. this makes my job so much easier start to finish.
not good after update. used to send invoices via email through my phone android before update cannot anymore. called customer service told me to uninstall and reinstall still same problem.. had to buy an ipad in able to send invoices :( horrible!
really good app. ok, at first i was reluctant to use it, but after trying it i found it really easy and simple. don't wait, use it.
editing invoices on the go!. i love it! when life is such a bustle and you need to create an estimate or invoice for customers, quickbooks makes it easy to do.
brilliant app with loads of features!. so easy to use. so easy to learn. instant bank feeds. invite your accountant & bookkeeper & other users. so much support from intuit & the australian team. what's not to like? intuit have put together a great product for the small to medium business owner. thoroughly recommend this product.
recommended. fantastic app, very handy and easy to use
works good for me.. for myself a small company works well for billing on the road. was able to download and email general information to acquire a business loan while on the road. not as customizable as some accounting software bit still great for the price. support is alright. i have talked to someone quickly every time i call during business hours.
i like it. does everything i need mobile. clients, invoices and information...all that i need on the go.
awesome. great program
much room for improvement. lack of a solid search function along with slow load times make this an app that leaves a lot to be desired. even the online functionality can use improvement. still a decent system for a small business but hopefully they'll spend some time fixing the app soon.
fantastic application. i love this app. it let's me manage my expenses and easily invoice on the go. great tool!
comments. there is no printing options for mobile printing. we have tu use other app, to print invoices. poor in reports not friendly to do invoices
. very poor and limited app. information displayed is quite different from the web view. i only want to see one thing  supplier invoices and outstanding balances and this app doesn't show them.
. literally couldn't even sign in. didn't recognise my details even though i'd just signed up and was forwarded to that page by the sign up process page. wouldn't send a reset password email. honestly totally worthless and wasted my time. non starter. not even worth an admin response as it's been deleted and the competition installed already.
. recent updates have greatly improved this app! it used to be hard to switch back to it if you opened another app, but that's now fixed. i love being able to invoice customers right away, record an expense (along with a photo of the receipt) and take a payment.
qb makes me look good. qb app is fantastic. i can write and present an estimate right at the job site or give my customer an invoice, or accept payment. in brief....it makes me look good!
frustrating. it's good to be able to use from iphone etc but i can't get any support or reply for help just doesn't happen seriously thinking of going back to reckon just because of this
. easy to use. great app
great update to already great app. the latest update is great! being able to reconcile through app is awesome. best accounting app out!!!
. awesome app, extremely useful to track finances.
. just unistalled and reinstalled the app hopefully it is going to work. after doing over 70 invoices it stopped working dashboard showed blank 😕
hate the app. limited functionality of the app makes it virtually useless... unless i have access to a pic or laptop, i can't do all the things i need to do. the program itself is good, just not sure why the app hasn't caught up yet.
clue live design. i'm a small business owner and pretty new on here too. since i have had quickbook payments i never receive any problem on the product via laptop, phone or ipad. i see the updates been give problem for others but it just work excellent for me.
. so far i haven't enjoyed this app. you can't scan a receipt with details auto uploading but you can on the selfemployed version and also had no luck at uploading a file into an expense when manually loading details from a receipt.
overdue but great! gorgeous!. this app is way, way overdue, but at least they got it right the first time around. no it doesn't do everything the website does, but nailed, adding buttons (functionality) is the easy part. it's definitely one of the best looking apps on my ipad.
. super easy to use...love that we can use it on multiple divices. awesome program
awesome cloud computing. this is great! i’ll never have to worry about whether or not i have a valid backup of my company data (as i did on the desktop version). my data is safely in the cloud and accessible to me from any device with internet access that i choose! tracking of income and expense easy here through the mobile app with access to reconciliation on the full web version. easy to use!
touch id stopped working with latest update. touch id stopped working with latest update. otherwise a great update. please fix!
. simple and straightforward to use. down side is at the moment its not comnecting to thw bank whis is causing mu accounts department teouble
. growing to like this app
updates have made it horrible. i love using the online version. the august updates however have tanked the app. it is no longer sharing information between my iphone, ipad, and mac. the sorting feature of estimates is now gone ( pending, accepted, closed) it only shows in last changed order, not good when working with 3 month or longer history. on a positive note, i do like the photo modification for the iphone. it no longer adds to my photo album, just imports to quickbooks.
. want to cancel my subscription doesn't even tell me how.
convenient but you pay for it. this app is really handy but they jack the prices up on you once you’ve gone through all the hassle of inputting your info. they know you won’t probably mess with changing programs once you’ve wasted all that time and energy. it is nice to use, however.
absolute magic. this app is brilliant it has made my account keeping so much easter and better, i'm not loosing bits of paper everywhere and find it much simpler to keep on top of everything (i think me using this has made my accountant much happier too as it has reduced his work load)
it gets better and better. i was a huge sceptic (i have been a pro advisor for several years)and very had a very negative opinion of qb online. that was until a couple of years ago when i attended a presentation of the capabilities of the software. i was sold on its usefulness and have been using and recommending it ever since. qb online adds important features regularly. buy it!!! you won't be disappointed
. super easy to create sales receipts and track sales and taxes. i love the option to include sales tax. i'm sure there are many other useful features that i'm not currently taking advantage of. thank you for this app!
. error message when i try to log in on my tablet. customer service offers little assistance after a long time on hold. this experience makes accounting for my small business even more unbearable. (update 11418): i dropped the review down to one star (from 2) because the error message is yet to be resolved on my tablet, three months later, and qb has increased the cost of their simple start plan by 30%. lame.
. great app
. having trouble switching the email account i want to use with this app. it keeps defaulting to my phone email.
doesn't work. app crashes on load and while logging in. pretty useless so far. :(
perfect. i migrated over from the computer version and so far it's awesome. i went out and bought a verizon tablet to make my billing easier in the field. i now can do everything before i walk out of the customers house, the days of going to the truck to write up a invoice are over!!!
यह ऑफलाइन में काम नहीं करेगा क्या? सॉफ्टवेर ऐसा बनाओ जो ऑफ़ लाइन में भी काम करे. not working in off line yeh off line me kam nahin kar raha hain
. invoices can't add cost except discounts to my invoices using my s4 phone.
multiple companies. love the app when it's working properly. doesn't switch between companies well, it'll show customers for my other company under the wrong account and makes it impossible to actually work from. i'm sure if you just have one business account it works fine.
great service. i enjoy each platform they offer for me, computer and iphone. only issue is they hiked up the annual price without notice. still affordable but i was expecting the same price i originally paid.
. great app for small business!!!
more than annoyed..... new update: 8916, still have to enter my password every time i open the app. touch id or app pin what is that??? 🤔 this is so annoying.... especially in front of customers!! tired of wasting my time. i've deleted and reinstalled the app to no avail. it appears you guys are never going to get it right....
. easy to maneuver love this app.
awesome!. easy and simple to use!
great support but app is flawed. i have several companies setup on one login. this was done by qb themselves but it keeps crashing, stalling or telling me there is a fault. also don't choose 'other' as business type as list of income and expenditure categories is massively reduced and you will have to add the ones you want manually. customer service is excellent but i shouldn't need to know this!
. this app works perfectly for making and sending invoices, addingediting new items, reviewing bills, etc. i haven't figured out how to download an invoice as a packing slip...sometimes i need that function, so have to go to my computer.
professional and practical. love this app! makes my business paperwork so much easier!
great app. easy easy for an accounting knucklehead like me. just give my acct the password for taxes and keep going. love it
quickbooks online for the ipad. it works great!! anywhere at anytime. create your customers, create the estimate and then bill it out!! if your smart you will setup the direct payment to your bank account too!!
gr8 system. for some one that's all thumbs and prehistoric to technology i found quickbooks not only easy and user friendly, but its approach to my business is so easy to follow, it's almost transparent.... heaps better than myob. and i speak from experience......
less than useless. this app does not interface enough of the information from the desktop version. reports are raw numbers and can’t pull up any supporting information. p&l is worthless. the desktop version seems to miss the point of accounting software. ie making all your information easy to input then easy to analyze in reports. this does neither. qbpro etc was far easier to navigate without the slick graphics and colors. aaaaaargh!
handy phone app. the iphone app has come in very handy for creating quick estimates on the road or adjusting existing quotes in the go
. this app is now horrible, it was great up until latest update and now i am unable to run my business using this app. very frustrating when an app takes steps backwards please help????
. makes my life as a designer and contractor so much easier
awesome app!. started my business with the start of this app since i'm a mobile mechanic and it's awesome to do quotes and invoices on the fly makes it easier to keep customers
great invoicing and management tool. awesome tool to keep your small business running at its best. highly automated, making it very easy to work with.
loads of bugs since updating to ios 13. broken links. can’t call up customer information. dashboard only shows banking information. invoices and estimates haven’t saved when generated on mobile device.
after a year, still not comfortable. not sure if it's me or the program.
liking it more and more. was able to set it up to do sale receipts on all devices. keep finding more and more to do with the app. would like to see reports on mobile devices.
great app. keeps me up to date with my rental properties. i always know where the finances are. makes the end of the month so quick and easy to finalize. it's fun.
seabreeze sealants. awesome app, makes running our business quick & easy in all aspects, we are able to stay in control of cash flow and invoices. highly recommend 👌🤙
quick books app. have been using quick books app for my business for a few months now, and i am very impressed with the package, as it's great value for money. i enjoy being able to use the app on my phone as it offer all the services that i need to be able to quickly raise and send invoices and pull up important info.
crash. your latest update is crashing. it doesn't let me open the app. please fix immediately
limited. every business owners wants to get to the bank registers fast...like the first thing! for some reason qbonline developers have not created a simple way to customize your home page so you can do this.
. so easy to post expenses from bank transactions.
critical simple feature still missing  for years!. please add the ability to print or download packing slips from the mobile app. everything else can wait till i am back in the office. sometimes a packing slip must be done in a rush. mobile app is useless to me without the packing slip feature.
. great software!!
amazing. but how do i change the currency? i need to use kenya shillings. i also can't see a trial balance
great app for every business. i have only played with this app a little to see what it can do, it is a great app for any service business, it automaticly updates all the records when you make a sell or a purchase. perfect if you are bad about keeping up with paperwork, this app will help u do it all as you go.
great for business on the move. this app is a solid connection to your quickbooks and allows for quick and straightforward posting of expenses, invoices and estimates.
. i messaged support about my subscription it was not what i wanted. i cancelled the account last month and was still billed and on the subscription. would like a refund on my card
. uggghhh..... why oh why oh why do developers continue to stuff things up with updates! get it right or leave it alone. how do i roll back to last version that worked?
buen contador. tiene muchas herramientas para hacer toda tu contabilidad.
. very good, i am on trial not sure how much full experience will cost, i'll update when i can
love it. it is nice to be able to enter expenses and check invoices on the run.
sales manager. love this app very easy to use has all i need to conduct business on a dayli basis
effective app!. truly effective application.
. excellent app, love it.
easy to use. love this app, easy to use.
nice interface, would like more features. works well for basic tasks. needs a few more features to be really helpful.
works and convenient. easy way to enter sales and expenses. i've had no problems with this app.
the best app thus far.. i use this for my business and it was a blessing in disguise. thanks qb for helping me organize my books.. even my accountant was impressed.
owner. we own a hvac business. this software is awesome.
. lacking abundantly completely unprofessional, there's about 5 options, you can't even put together an invoice that you could realistically give to a customer. i'm very very disappointed.
. at some point the app stopped attaching photo receipts to my expenses. now i've lost several months worth of receipts.
great efficient and cost effective. this app is great and accounting system is too. best value for the money and easy to use.
app crashes. this app crashes or cannot save my data on every entry i make. horrible app!!
. não consigo acessar. tenho login e senha mas me aparece uma mensagem que a função não é aceita somente via web
horrible update!. wow this latest update has messed everything up quickbooks was finally working good please fix! some of the words don't even fit correctly on the screen its all mixed together! and worst of all like others have said it no longer knows my clients email address i have to manually input!
. good app
. hard to use. i bought it because of taking pictures of my receipts and i've yet to get that done. plus the app doesnt work on my phone. have to log in each time. if i had it to do over again i would not waste my money.
for last month since major online update its is useless. when i login it tells me i don’t have a subscription. i call support they tell me to uninstall the app and reinstall. after reinstall the login works but you cannot switch between your companies. i called them back. they said no one else is reporting this. three users in my offivr are having the same problem. i love the iphone app for entering receipts on the go but i can’t even do that now.
super efficient. this app has streamlined my workflow 100%
fantastic application. i love this app. it let's me manage my expenses and easily invoice on the go. great tool!
impressive for mobile. i posted a bad review because of some bugs. i received an immediate response about upcoming updates and a week later it was fixed. i love that level of support. nice app too.
handy. as long as i have internet connection i can create new customers, create invoices, and bill the job right at the job. i can input cash receipts and any bank charges that have cleared.
invoices don’t look great. the issue i had when using quickbooks was the invoices just didn’t look very polished or professional. there’s a way of setting up a custom invoice, but really you want a good default so you don’t have to muck around.
great app. i have no complaints.
. worst app ever. at best there is a 30 second lag when opening the app, at worst it freezes my phone up and i have to restart the whole phone. the app doesn't display most of my customer transactions. awful, ill be finding a new cloud based accounting service.
no true inventory integration. so intuit is apparently letting the vultures take it on this one with letting a third party company charge you a hundred and forty on top of the $40 per month for plus... intuit should include a nice inventory app with qbop, i'm saying everything from being able to put a cost of goods that you put materials into an inventory item to taking pictures of items. where's the mobile support????
. excellent app.
easy. works when i need it to
great app. makes life easy. one addition will make it perfect. add journal entry to the app.
. quick easy useful
. love the convenience of quickbooks app. makes invoicing and everything else so easy!
does everything i need it to do. the app is easy to use and does everything i need it to do.
. its very good program keeping my books in order, reminding of unpaid invoices connects to external management software, great stuff
incredibly glitchy. the app is glitchy despite updates. i’m not super impressed by intuit in general. i use their payroll for my business, a lot of glitches there too. app crashes or spontaneously exits my selections to “accept” for no reason and i have to start over. does not learn well, i have to reteach things over and over.
. why can't i edit an invoice number? my only complaint is that i am unable to edit the invoice number. this prevents me from creating invoices on the go.
all the essentials in an app. works good so far. allows for quick sorting of transactions and gives all of the essential components for a mobile version. it would be nice to be able to work in budgets in app.
. i liked it.. i just logged into my bank account from this app and all myvanking info was there like my investments, chequeing and savings accounts all in 1 place... it's more for business people and you have 2 pay monthly fees
. needs lots of work yet. it's not fullfunction, and lists with subelements are totally useless. now that qboe is more tabletready, skip this app and go straight to qboe.intuit.com with your favorite browser.
poor service. difficult to set up invoice template and negotiate site, customer service poor, and when you try to write a review and send it off if the nickname is taken you have to write it all out again. as usual well advertised on tv but fails to deliver.
great app!!!!. i am a simple tradie and this app has made life so easy! not complicated easy fast and effective.
. great app
not even close to online or desktop versions. at the cost of not wanting to hire a secretary my consultant had me switch to online version from desktop, it sucks! used to update q.b. desktop every 3 yrs (when forced to) for $150 and now pay around $400 a year for less function. the direct qb online site is better from my mobile device than the actual app. the options between app and website dont function the same. terrible!
pretty good 9 months in. really good, can't do pay roll or vat reports on the app but just about everything else. photo receipts for expenses and checking received payments. very useful. f
attachment quality is terrible. the quality of the attachments when taking pictures of things like receipts compresses my photos down to almost indistinguishable. i am using a galaxy s4 and the uploaded pictures are 50kb. at least allow me to choose my compression rate. it allows 25 mb attachments. please fix this!
very satisfied!. been using the mobile app for the past 2 months now, and i can say it does everything i need. very easy to issue invoices, receive the money, match, reconcile the bank, calculate the vat! the support people are very helpful and have a lot of patience!
. good app really i enjoy working with it
. cannot log in don't have online subscription
handy. the mobile app is very convenient for entering expenses on the go. you can add photos of receipts and create new customers and suppliers easily. profit & loss and balance sheet function gives you a quick snapshot of your business. overall, the app is quite handy to use for small businesses.
. i've used it for around 18 months so far and i love it. i hated accounting in university so it was my biggest fear when setting up a business. quickbooks has made it really easy.
. really quick and simple set up. easy to use. no problems so far. perfect for a small business.
horrible mobile support!. this app has a ton of problems and nobody at intuit cares to fix it. app won't load half the time, invoices do not show up, errors all the time, signature capture doesn't work, and no support available for the mobile app. the only thing they know is to tell you to uninstall and reinstall it which fixes nothing! if they don't get their issues fixed, i am switching!
. app banking does not work on android pixel 3. crashes as its loading transactions. i called quickbooks and got the runaround, didnt take my issue seriously. stuck using computer
works well on samsung note 2 & 4. i used the app mainly to create invoices when i'm out of the office. it's so awesome to be able to do this on the fly!
good app!. add travel tracking to app
. good app does great now that you can do more with it!
better than xero. brilliant app. seamless to use. all of my clients now use it!
crashes with galaxy s7 edge android 6.0.1. i have a new samsung galaxy s7 edge running android 6.0.1. every time i try to log into the app it crashes when signing in and offers to send a report. but the send crash report button results in blue screen. have to force close. very frustrated as i am used to using the app constantly. update: customer support was able to assist with the issue once i emailed them.
statement from app ?. works great for me but i wish you were able to print off a statement from the app.
. installed on android yesterday. cannot see anything on dashboard. called customer service and they don't know anything about the issue and can't help. she said she can see it on her iphone. account can be seen on desktop version but the mobile app is useless.
. great program! time saving system. wish i had estimate vs actual report.
quickbooks. super easy to use! i was able to backlog and bring my business up to speed with quickbooks within a few hours after downloading quickbooks! operating the app is fun and accessible!
super & excellent apps. very user friendly application . i would recommend this software to other people
superbly designed. having used two competitors' products before, i've been very pleasantly surprised with quickbooks. it's really easy to use but, at the same time, it has lots of really helpful features. the app is well designed but my only gripe is that i am sometimes unable to login. the problem usually corrects itself after a while, but it's a bit annoying when i need it at the time. nevertheless, the product is so good that this doesn't even bother me much.
great app. i run a it buisness. have loved using this app. i love being able to do invoices while i'm away from my computer.
crashes. constantly crashes and doesnt work as promised.
couldn't do it without this app. love this app. sooooo mobile friendly!
purchase orders. i've requested this over and over with no response. the inability to create a purchase order via a mobile device is very, very inconvenient.
. no1 app
useless. my boss uses qb to track my hours. as far as i can tell, i can't make those changes on this app. that makes this app totally useless to me.
. great app, very ready to track income and expenses. making and tracking invoices is so easy even easier then on the computer, reports and everything is really easy to access and track.
. how much does it cost per month or per year? i have quickbooks software on my pc does it link with the software on my personal computer?
great!. versatile and wonderful app
love it. ian finally able to track my expenditures and income totally on the go. no more playing catch up! love that i have receipt images and that i can make notes that will refresh my memory on the exact thing i bought. just getting to putting my logo on invoices... i know that there is a lot mor that i can do with this program i am very much a beginner love what it does so far!!!!
cannot sign in with new update. i can’t sign in. keeps telling me my information is wrong even after resetting the password.
horrible mobile support!. this app has a ton of problems and nobody at intuit cares to fix it. app won't load half the time, invoices do not show up, errors all the time, signature capture doesn't work, and no support available for the mobile app. the only thing they know is to tell you to uninstall and reinstall it which fixes nothing! if they don't get their issues fixed, i am switching!
for phone. could be easier to use if it was more like the pc edition
. es un excelente programa, pero no encuentro opción para idioma español, está disponible en español la versión mobil ?
organized. been in business for 20 years and been using this app for a year. love it. still lots beyond my abilities and i wish there was a little more help in the app for the accounting inept like me but i just bring the app to my accountant and they can pull all the data needed. recommend it. see sales, cost, accounts receivable at any given moment.
. so far...i began adding my customers, payments, sales receipts etc, and it's working out well! pretty simple so far!
. pathetic when it cimeys to app. never gives real time update. often can't refresh. a big no
in sync. i would give it a 5 if the ipad and android versions were synced faster and had the same features.
excellent. first time setting up a new business and first time i've used book keeping software. you can do so much with just this app  it's incredibly intuitive and so easy to use. stops me being afraid of the numbers side of my business and just lets me get on with work! absolute game changer. love it.
. great app for small businesses
. lousy compared to the ios app. bank does not sync and invoices that are over due don't show up
overall good product. not having access to the entire online tools on the app makes for complicated tasks at times. the online browser does not run fluently with a safari browser so if i need anything beyond basics i need to get to a pc.
no purchase orders. for years now quickbooks has withheld the ability to create purchase orders through the mobile app. this is a huge issue for our company and it is quite frustrating that qb has willfully omitted this feature. i wish there was a way to convince qb to change course on this decision...
game changer. changed the way i handle my business transactions. from a simple to complex my invoices and estimates are presentable, traceable and accounted for. my reports help me secure loans in a flash. and my accountant loves me.
amazing app!!. our business reconciliation just became simplified. easy to use and online access allows us to work on the go. highly recommend if you wish to save time.
. brilliant app, very easy to use even for beginners. also has great customer support for your problems and queries.
handy app.. i've struggled for a while with record keeping and this app makes it very easy to keep records and do my day to day book keeping.
rp. would love to be able to print invoices from my phone. is this an option?
. does everything i need it to.
"""sign in"" button doesn't work.. couldnt create an account because the button to send verification sms wouldn't work. no time for that. moved on."
best accounting software i've tried. this has got to be the most intuitive feature rich reasonably priced cloud computing package for small business i've ever seen. waaay better than myob, such a great little app.
what happened?. this app used to work perfectly. after the last update i can't use it how i used too. if they do not fix it soon i am going to have to look into other options
quickbook app is it working after updating iphone to the latest version ios 13. when you open the app it auto close. basically can’t open the app
incredible. this is an incredible application. if you're looking to intuitively streamline your business this is definitely the app for you!
keeps crashing. i am on an iphone 6s and running the most recent ios. every time i try to accept my transactions in my bank account, i get through a few then the app shuts down.
qbo ipad & iphone. i think that intuit is doing an incredible job with this product! the updates have been wonderful for me. i would love to be able to make transfers between accounts, but i am thoroughly pleased with this product.
needs help. need to adjust the address in the statement area. doesn't fit in the window of envelope. checked the help box, several others having same problem.
"great app. android sg5 needs (negative) """" option when editing the amount entry on invoices."
fantastic. i love this app! it's very useful
disappointed. i just switched from my trusty iphone to an android phone, this app on my iphone was perfect! it had a list of products and services, unlike the android version. it also loaded all the estimates and invoices for all my customers, this android version hardly has any of my past transactions! please make this like the ios app!
tek9. isai tek
. great for business. keeps track of all your records. would defiantly recommend the app to everyone.
my expectations of quick books.. i would expect the quick books would gave been able to give me a complete overview of my accounts and businesses. e.g. i can't find anywhere in the program where i can print my company's balance sheet or my company's profit and loss accounts, to name a few. why is this so?
. qbo is great... however, the app sucks! the info on the home page is rarely if ever correct. paid invoices show as still do, p&l info is incorrect compared to what it shows on the website. now i can't edit downloaded transaction to add an image of my receipts. plus, it's no longer showing all of my accounts when i go to categorize a transaction. what the heck happened?!
qb makes me look good. qb app is fantastic. i can write and present an estimate right at the job site or give my customer an invoice, or accept payment. in brief....it makes me look good!
garbage. signed up to their free trial, spent hours putting up my receipts only to be told i have to start again because of an error at their end. now locked out of my account and all my original receipts have faded taking even more hours trying to communicate with them to gain access to my account
great app. i love this app!!!
. this app doesn't work! such a disappointment to say the least! i'll edit my review once the app is available for use! still not working!
doesn’t mirror quickbooks online. it’s good for looking up customer info like what they owe or phone numbers. if you create an invoice online you may not be able to edit it on the phone. and if you use quickbooks for time tracking the feature doesn’t seem to be in the cards for the mobile app.
deceiving. silly me. i thought quickbooks had somehow released a free service. i installed this app, and the first thing i am presented with is a screen asking me to sign up for a free trial. sorry, $12.99 per month is just not worth it for quickbooks until they finally build a decent rental business module. i hate being tricked into downloading apps that are actually not free.
. zero! the app says it needs to update, then brings me to a screen giving a choice of uninstall or open. if i choose open, i'm back to the need to update. if i uninstall and reinstall, that's just more steps before i'm back to the same useless place. garbage software. update: this was a problem they had seen and were working on. they fixed it and informed me of the fix a few hours later. working now.
. great program
. for what i do this was a complete waste of money. . it was supposed to import all my all my spreadsheet and all that information over to my taxes when i signed up with tax turbotax or whatever it was. it doesn't nor did it. and now it keeps trying to charge me $60 for something after i cancel my subscription because all it did was make my taxes more complicated than they had to be.
pos for the online version. very unhappy because after 5 years they still don’t have a pos system for the online version.
very convenient!. this app has saved me on so many occasions. being able sending invoices and estimates onthego is awesome.
. the loading response is rather slow.
five star, defenitly!! :d. quickbook app is a great add to the software program. easy to use, fast and well organize!
great app for my small business. went from excel and pdfs to qb..great decision! i'm very happy with it. one function i'd like to see added is integration with iphoneipadoutlook calendar.
app can’t find our data. we are days into this app not being able to access our data: accounting, banking, billing. access is only available through certain browsers on a laptopdesktop. the support team is friendly and wished me luck.
. it's a great app but needs to simplify some processes.
very disappointed. i'm very disappointed because i have been unable to login on with my iphone or macbook pro. i tried to get help through customer service but all i got was a link. very disappointed!!
intuitive and robust.. a welldesigned, robust application. with functionality that crisscrosses accounting and nonaccounting domains, this is definitely a winner and a keeper. as other reviewers have said, support is amazing. the app is always evolving and improving. 5 stars for easeofuse, robustness and flexibility.
ok. app ok
great app. overall its a great app. you can do many things from the app that you can do on the desktop version. i would like to be able to enter the worked hours on the app and also to be able register vendor invoices not only expenses.
can't add or view expenses. the expenses option is not available! so why to have this app then?
. this is of great help! i can update our business transactions anytime, anywhere! thanks! 😊
mileage is a joke. i upgraded to this account from the self employed version and the mileage is a joke. i thought the self employed was horrible. it completely missed a whole day of travel and cut’s off trips in the middle of traveling. or cuts the trips starting and ending if it even records the visit.
great. makes invoices and estimates from phone look right professional. i use the desktop version as well and it would be great if the different versions spoke to each otherwise best solution by far
. great experience
. this app requires a password even though i chose google login. if i need a password anyway, what's the point of a google login?! quickbooks online doesn't require it. disappointed and uninstalling. i have enough accounts as it is.
scott. i find the app to be a great addition to the desktop version. having access to all invoices and customers through my phone is excellent.
. need user mode in apps
still needs work. not all features are equally accessible on pc, ipad or iphone, such as selecting different estimate and invoicing templates. most likely a bug and would love to see that fixed . the online version on the pc is slowwww
five stars!. has helped out tremendously when it comes to my business. it makes it so much easier to use then the paper receipt books. it helps me stay organized and keeps me updated to the second. thanks quickbooks!
. i had an inapp issue and received help immediately. i love this app and really appreciate you guys. you make my life a lot easier, 💯💯
useless. can’t share the online app with my accountant. frustrating and useless!!!!
. easy to use and navigate. makes business life so much easier
how bad????. i would love to write a review, but as i've been trying to get this app to log in to my online account for 5 months now it's going to be a little difficult. but not as difficult as trying to get any customer support for this app. i could write a whole book on how impossible that is. so so disappointed. no help with this problem what so ever. frustrated!!!!!
angela. i had quick books in the past when i ran a shoe store and it was wonderful. my problem today is i'm starting a night club and the app has been installing for an hour with no response could you please assist me i'm down loading it on my android phone. it's very important that i hear from you because this system was wonderful.
. i have tried the thrial for my buisness and found it projected profits higher than actual and expenses that didn't match up regardless to synching it to accounts like square or my bank. if this is the trial then im not sold. if i had turned this apps inaccurate projections into the irs they'd audit the hell out of me. ill stick to good old fashion analog style accounting thank you.
love the app. honestly this is the best app around, does it all with ease. i run my whole business through this app off my phone and tablet. never once had a problem.
pretty good but, but no bill entry????. i have found this to be somewhat helpful for reviewing expenses, but it would be fantastic if i was able to pay bills on the go. i would love to be able to keep my business mobile by using the camera to “scan” invoices and submit them for payment right from the app. a core function that is surprisingly absent. this is a must for future development. without it, the app just come up short...
excellent. great mobile app from intuit, quickbooks online is great and although a bit different from the desktop version it has improved the way i work with my clients
. love it!!! works great with the online site, as a business owner this app is very useful.
crashes. won't open. immediately crashes. please fix
roy. great for on the go work. would be even better if you could request payment from the app. (ipn) then you get a 10 star.
🎼love it!!!🎉. we have a construction company, quick books online is a dream come true for us. we can present a client with a proposal at the time of the estimate, get a signature, a deposit, get the job started right away. thank you quick books. 🤓
. terrible app, customer service is a joke with no follow up. switching to a different accounting software.
. doesn't open, tried reinstalling and clearing cache. used to work.
. a great app that accomplishes pretty much what one may expect. some minor limitations compared to the full online's layout, but still very handy and easy to use.
terrible. this software is absolutely horrible. on all platforms.
touch id. the app works well once you've signed in, but the touch id still isn't working properly. you have to sign in manually first. then, it allows you to switch between apps using touch id to sign back in for a while. however, if you sign out completely, it appears you can't use touch id to sign back in again. i thought the whole purpose of touch id was to avoid having to enter your password each time and to increase security.
. worthless, the accounting app never worked. it kept kicking me out.
. i've been trying to use this app for months and months. it doesnt work, and nobody has done anything about the problems even though there are numerous complaints and bad reviews. i'm getting ready to stop paying for quickbooks and find something else. i mainly wanted to us the app for taking pictures of receipts, but due to the syncing issues, i can't submit more than one receipt picture without the app hanging or freezing. i've tried reinstalling, clearing cache, etc. with no luck.
. very simple to use.
. very easy to work with and always someone to help you if problems occur
. does every thing i need it to do, and i can do it on my phone. so easy to navigate. wouldn't want to run my business without it.
bugs and features not working. there is a lot of potential here but also problems. our accountant would like us to use this software yet some of the features don’t work on the mobile app and even on the website there are still many bugs. the biggest is only a few of the accounts created in chart of accounts are available. most are not available in the app and even on the website are “greyed out” and off limits.
does not work. app does not work. wish it did, but it does not. none of my vendor activity shows up, profit and loss does not scroll past first page. better no app at all than one that does not work.
easy to use. not too bad need more bug fixings
app is good, online version great. i do love the ease of use of online version. however, i wish i would have access to bank accounts and credit card accounts on the app. please add these features!
. great app, sometimes had trouble with login
quickbooks made simple. though i'm still not totally familiar with qb in general the app definitely makes it much easier and convenient to use and track accounts activity etc.
no register?. why would there be a quickbooks app without the main part......the register?
easy to use. i love my quickbooks app. this is the first year my taxes will be done on time because i didn't have to spend hours at desk!
slowly losing my business. i'm about tired of this app not functioning properly. embarrassing to say the least when i have a customer trying to pay their bill and i can't even connect to quickbooks online server. none of your apps are working as advertised. $25month for what again? vendor profile on iphone isn't in sync with current information online. trying to enterview bills within a certain vendor and it's showing info from 2016.
love it. done right.. finances done right. only quirk is the need to type password fairly regularly, plus only prompted touch id some of the time. apple watch app often wants me to log in on phone first.
thumbs up. great addition to the online software
. recent updates have greatly improved this app! it used to be hard to switch back to it if you opened another app, but that's now fixed. i love being able to invoice customers right away, record an expense (along with a photo of the receipt) and take a payment.
this update is total trash!!!!. errors on just about everything i try to do and things save twice and web pages aren't ready for ipad pro! don't update!!!!!
quick and easy. had a few teething issues getting used to the system, but i fund it easier to work and the app makes it easy to take shots of receipts to add electronic records
. useful
. you did an update on friday afternoon while i need to use the program. now i can't access the program because i need to do an update that o cant do because of a glitch in the update
. can't log in why won't it let me sign in? this is awful! please fix quickly!!
crash books pro. this terrific app asks you every few minutes to rate their program knowing that you want to tell the world how you can't send out an invoice without the app crashing. *update* i am having more issues with the app then ever. i can only assume quickbooks is either more useless then i thought. or they are retaliating for my review of their product. i have never had any program work this bad and i have worked it.
. great app. i have had excellent customer service experiences.
. love the app. can do work any place.
. love this app.. so easy to use!!!!
buggy. can't even login to my account. after i enter my username and password, the app clears the password field and doesn't login.
really helpful!!. i am a computer engineer and being able to make estimates and invoices in the field has really helped me!
i love this app. this is the easiest to use and simplest way to use it.
crapapp. quickbooks program is nice though the company's blatant lack of interest in the osx platform baffles me... this app is basically worthless and does not update to changes made online four weeks ago... they have light years to go before this app is worthy of being used...
great program. i like it's ease of and accessibility from anywhere. i haven't had any issues.
quick as a wink. very handy and does the job.
aes. great app, worth the investment
. app crashes all the time
user friendly. it's like working from a regular laptop or computer. sync is done immediately and i can do any transactions anywhere. i love it!
. the image quality of attaching receipts automatically downgrades and makes everything blurry. this renders the receipt image capture completely useless.
useless  data download errors. the app worked great for the past couple years and now all the sudden it keeps crashing when trying to download my data. i own a mobile business and now i'm having to preplan and print invoices before i show up because the app is useless.
a great improvement over the mac desktop version. it saves me tons of time that i used to spend recording payments, expenses and running reports. client payments are easily paid via credit card by the client and automatically applied to the invoice. it has simplified my accounting.
good app!. i like the app. it let's me run quick books from my phone (gs5) in the field and it runs smoothly. doing estimates on site is great.
business. i'm very happy with this app help me a lot
life saver. apart from the fact i have to input my password every time, this app is a great compliment to the version i use on my laptop. so easy to use, can invoice on the spot. very happy.
great!. continues to impress and improve on this very useful app. i use it daily for bids, invoices and expenses. the addition of the ability to record expenses and photograph receipts has made my life so much more easy. and to be able to quickly add clients, easy estimates and quick invoices and finally receive payments is unbelievable and wonderful.
crashes. this app fails all the time, i keep having to reinstall to log in.
great small business app. love this app for my working vacations!
. works amazing when having to do my invoices on the fly and can't get to the office. also to check my estimates
not bad needs a little work. online is getting better with each update. still needs more options with mobile and ipad. one for sure needs to have bank account option on payment received
mechanic shop. just starting out with the program but it seems to work great!!!
. it's a great app. i use it all the time with my company. very efficient, and easy to navigate. automatically logs out so no one else can get access to it ( logs out after being in active for a certain amount of time). making banking, estimate invoice, and employees records very easy to keep track of. also love that i can store customers an accept payment online also. only downside sometimes it can be slow but other than that it's outstanding
mr. brilliant accountancy software,simple to use in the office or on the go.
crap. this update is crap. my invoices won't update with the ipad. nothing like beta testing on your customers. typical for quickbooks
pretty but not functional. it's bizarre how the graphics continue to be improved but the functionality doesn't. i've been trying to use this app for years but the features i need on the go are missing such as timekeeping. mostly this app seems to work a lot like you would imagine quicken mobile to work, by being able to look up past banking transactions. but i can do that on my banking apps for free already.
great app!. just need the ability to take a photo of a receipt and upload it and then it'll be 5 stars (i understand this is something that the online application is lacking as well)
fantastic product overall. the mobile app gets about 3 stars but desktop version is 2nd to none. overall love quickbooks and it has helped my business. although mobile app not as good, it's nice to have on the go when i need info on prior jobs out in the field. what i don't like about mobile app is that it won't automatically put next invoice number like the desktop version, that would be a nice fix!
jl. great for small business on the go.... got it sync with square and it makes it even better. great job!!!
not useful at all. this was a waste of time. i need to be able to reconcile and do more than look at my recent transactions. quick books is useless unless you're on a computer.
. i love the simple features on the app.
awesome. can't imagine running my business without this app. total complete solution for mobile businesses like mine. my accounting is done so much quicker, and i love being able to see all client info from the phone. thank you, thank you and thank you!!
. great app. for business on the go. love doing invoices com my smart phone.
so much that's so wrong. this rating is for qbo overall, because the app lives in an infrastructure. qbo is rapidly becoming the biggest pos in the accounting world. not sure what they’re trying to do, but it isn’t producing a usable set of books. the app is just a small part of the collapse.
. good app but could definitely use a few key features added to make it that much more usable for my type of business
banking. great app just the banking doesn’t always pull over on fist couple tries to load transactions
. awesome app for lawyers
gets the job done. very helpful app. works well. no issues that i have experienced.
. absolutely overwhelming! you surround yourselves with the most incredible and pleasant staff. bill, just like the the other individuals that i talked with in the last two days are extraordinary and simply the best. thanks a lot for all your help. pedro
a very useful application. i find it quite convenient to be able to enter expenses from my phone and include photographs receipts when i am on the go. i use quickbooks online and although the app is limited in some respects as far as functionality goes the limits that other reviewers have discussed has not affected my business at all. i like it a lot :)
. i am finally happy 99% with qb online quickbooks has finally added the ability to add expences through the android market. it is now, by far the easiest way to send out estimates, invoices and add expenses. i'm a contractor and it works perfect for what i do. well worth the $40.00 a month, trust me. ............
crashes. crashes immediately after i open the application. update was recently done and now i can't use it.
great app!. i can operate from my cell phone and know where i stand in my finances while on the go! great app.
quick books app. have been using quick books app for my business for a few months now, and i am very impressed with the package, as it's great value for money. i enjoy being able to use the app on my phone as it offer all the services that i need to be able to quickly raise and send invoices and pull up important info.
i love quickbooks online. i love quickbooks online & my accountant does also. this app is really good for doing your expenses on but as far as invoicing i still do it on the computer. it's very handy for a small business. the fact you can enter an expense, take a picture of the receipt & go on your merry way. i'm sold.
. i do invoices and print from my recliner. love this app. and sometimes generate estimates minutes after finishing my work before leaving the clients home. very convenient !!
. app runs extremely slowly and often won't even open. it freezes almost constantly. using a galaxy s8 phone.
. pretty good app.
. awesome app
i am discussed with your country list. you have palestine listed. it is not even a country. israel is where i live. i will be blasting this all over the web and deleting this app from my phone. thank you for your reply but again, palestine does not exist. it hasn't since 1948
. incredibly buggy, takes forever to open and crashes on every action. cannot move from xero to quickbooks while the apps remains this bad.
backward compatibility entrapment. i thought i’d try the trial online plus version after being happy with essentials. was not advised during the offer that going back meant having to reenter much of my historical data manually. now i pay for features i do not use or like. their help desk just kinda said...’oh well’. they didn’t even offer to extend the trial offer incentive that had me curious about the product. intuit calls it ‘stickiness’. i call it entrapment.
efficient. makes my life a lot easier i can create invoices. customers can pay their bill right in front of me what i sent them to the email. can’t get no better than that
add receipt photos!!!. please this feature is desperately needed. you did it for the self employed app why not for this more expensive version???
. reasonable app, i don't ask much of it to be honest but being able to invoice onsite is nice. the feature for photographing receipts is pointless as you still have to enter all of the information anyhow, and it would be nice to be able to send a customer a statement from the app while i'm stood in front of them. i don't use the receive online payment option so i can't comment.
cody. no reports. no p&l. can not work with downloaded transactions, which for me is critical. looks good, but is not really useful if your trying to get work done. maybe it will get better!
freedom. great piece of software as i'm able to invoice customers right from a tablet and be on my way!! well done!
small business owner. absolutely awful. i was forced to switch to online because of a fatal error of the desktop version on mac seirra. there are so many bugs and things that aren't available on online that were on the desktop. i literally call support for 2hrs a day.
. so far so good. we are happy with the app. makes invoicing and estimating easy to get out from my pick in last minute situations.
this app does not function properly on ios13. i cannot view any customer files. i can search for them, but the app will not let me click on a customer to edit invoices.
app shows incorrect transactions. transactions do not match the selected vendor. works when you have few transactions. once you pass 20k it becomes slow and inaccurate.
. good app
touch id and pin not working. i down loaded the update; the update was suppose to help improve touch id and the pin. however, now bone of them work and i have to sign in every time. i tried it on my iphone and ipad neither work. disappointing
not happy. when i first got the app i fell in love i had problems with the desktop version , with the bank option on the online version witch you removed i was able to log in my transactions very quickly , i would appreciate it if you would please bring back the bank option in the menu asap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
works okay but app needs work. funny how if they spent a little more time and money on their point of sale app that they could get two to three times the amount of business. the app needs work. there needs to be more options for customizing the invoice and it really lacks customer management ability. if your just going paperless it’s not bad but like i said the app could really use some work.
. can't upgrade... even with tech support's help they can't figure out how to make it work. after writing this review support contacted me and managed to upgrade.
fabulous!. i really like using qb, i'm a small business owner and once i got the idea of things i find qb relatively easy to use. when integration starts with square it will be 5 stars for me 😊
. so far this has made invoices quick and easy
paypal integration very poor. quickbooks say it integrates with paypal and automatically downloads transactions. well, it does partly, but doesn't download into expenses the transaction fees with paypal here, meaning you have to do it manually. it will do it for an online purchase to the same account so why it doesn't work properly is a complete mystery and one support do not help with.
. this is an awesome app. make my life so much easier!! it easy to use for my home business.
absolutely amazing highly recommend. way better then xero and myob.
great product!. i'm good at what i do for a living, but i am not an accountant and i needed help keeping the financial end of my business on track. this product is easy to use and is everything i needed!
just what i needed. i run a small contractor business doing remodel work. the mobile app has been a godsend. i can track all my estimates, invoices & expenses in one place. helps me track clients that are late payers too (which sometimes happens). i like it. 100% worth the subscription
. po , translation invoice, how to add discount?
working great. app is easy to use on the go. some things are better done on desktop but for the most part can do a invoice from phone and accept payments.
works great. this app works perfect for recording our small farms purchases and sales. it is very easy and convenient to use.
. great app, love throwing away receipts just take a picture of the expense, document it, and bam, you're done.
. the app worked great before, it had some minor issues here or there but now it is horrible. when i try to add an expense it only shows me 4 of my vendors and the only account i can assign is the cogs account. now i have to save all my receipts and remember to enter them when i get back to the office. what a pain. yes, my desktop app works just fine. please fix the issue, i loved the functionality before.
. fantastic app! so easy to use and send invoices in seconds. love it!
i love it. love the invoices!
business. great app
. this app sucks. it has stopped working and often displays incorrect information. it's super annoying. only the desktop works.
not bad. app is good. qb online is lacking.
. so far so good; this app should provide a snapshot of the company as first view.
app does not support multicurrency. it’s 2018. apps have been around for quite a while now. if your qbo account has multiple currencies enabled, you can’t use this app for banking. seriously, wtf?
. i love it invoice right on the job
great app!. this app saves me so much time! it lets me run my business much more efficiently! wouldn't be quite as successful without it. it also has very professional invoices and estimates
capturing expenses? approving transactions?. really nothing no support for the consultant on the go? why can't i shoot a picture of a receipt put a dollar value a catagory and a note and have it either for review or added to my expenses. what about my transaction list i can't see the same information from the full website here at all. throw us a bone man....
excellent app. keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
. ive been in business for years greatperfectawesome...invoices on the smartphone that save accross all devices!
. since the update can't add trips for mileage. app was working perfectly before the update. app won't allow addresses to be added like before. why not just leave well enough alone?
almost perfect. just missing two things, edit or view notes online, and no touch id needed any time i try to open the app
fail update.. update never savessends invoices on either of my 2 devices
keeps everything in one place. great app! i keep all my business and personal expenses logged and in place from my phone. i can also track multiple companies. gives me so much piece of mind and way easier for keeping track of taxes and book keeping.
address. please allow me to copy and paste full address inside customer section. currently i can only copy street, city, postal code separately. customer wants me to add address of site worked.
. please add support for whattsup business app
. very easy to use. the online version is great for keeping updated, and also for multi user function. i always recommend it!
not impressed.. i literally have to 'reset' my password about 9 out of 10 times when i go to use this app....it keeps telling me my user name or password are wrong(they are actually not) and so i keep 'changing' my password to the same password that it has been......very frustrating that almost every time i am visiting a client, i have to spend 810 minutes on accessing the info from the app.
can not do custom invoice numbers. the app can not do custom invoice numbers. i have had the app for two months and paying the monthly fees and have not been able to send out my first proper invoice. i have asked support and they come back with instructions to go to certain settings that do not exist on the app.
great app!. i love the mobility of the app. it helps me stay on top of my bookkeeping work while i'm on the go. makes managing multiple businesses that much easier!
great app!. our company switched from quickbooks desktop to the online version which came with the option to download the app. we now use the app more than online. we handle estimates, invoices, payments, banking and more directly in the app and on the go. the app has a simple and clean look making it easy to navigate. to date we haven't had any issues with it. we are excited to finally be able to get things done in less time!
loved the app until banking disappeared. i mainly use my computer to do most of our accounting but loved having the app so i could accept banking transactions during short periods of downtime thereby keeping our bank balance up to date all the time. then today i went to catch up on accepting transactions and banking has totally disappeared from the menu. help! what happened? i deleted and reinstalled the app to no avail.
. app is crashing. also, when it does log in successfully, it doesn't remember my state from previous login. it needs to downloads stacks of data all over again.
. great app .... just makes life easy!!!
. awesome app very easy to use. make doing business on the road super easy
getting frustrated. i hate that the computer version keeps crashing. the app is nice but doesn't have all the features of the web version (or if they are there i haven't found them yet!)
it works great!. great app and works flawlessly.
. my exsprience was very pleasing. you guys are truly good at what you do! thank you! julius
. it works well for my small biz. very happy.
how can a customer approve an estimate??. why do you have the electronic signature function available for the ipad and not android?? it defeats the purpose of having a tablet on the job site. i may as well stick with my 3 part form.
prettt good. it’s a good app, i’d have given it 5 stars but the sequential number doesn’t load when using the app. this means to produce an invoice you have to go back and look up the last invoice number.
. simple and easy to use. professional
old version was better. the functionality of being able to invoice on the go is great but the reports were much better in the old version. used to be able to easily click who owes me and who i owe. wish this had the company snapshot report as a report option.
. awesome app that assists me to carry out my personal finance activities
. i've got self employed subscription but app doesn't recognise it
. after create id , app can't proceed for making company. when you touch curcel reload page automatically. how can proceed to next step? so i not suggest this app.
great app. perfect for all your business on the run needs.
very beneficial app. this is a very beneficial app. it does not replace the pc version but is an excellent aid. it's helpful to send invoices on the go or at the end of a service call. the sooner the customer gets invoice the more chance i have of getting paid. it is a very good aid!
. a really good platform for small business. the program is user friendly and has a great online help community and customer service.
. best way to keep books. great way to run reports and see profits and losses
quickbooks online for the ipad. it works great!! anywhere at anytime. create your customers, create the estimate and then bill it out!! if your smart you will setup the direct payment to your bank account too!!
. excellent easy to use, logical app. saves me loads of time
fix this!. when using my new iphone x the app crashes every time i try selecting the “invoices” button?! also... constantly have to log in and log out to update my information?! why?! please fix these major issues!
great fing app!!. i love this app, everything syncs over so well from the web version. it's very simple to use and makes my job a hell of a lot easier!!
. android user app is convenient and easy to maneuver. i lile that i can remain productive on the go!
too many error messages. for what you pay for a quickbooks online account, this app for ipad and iphone is really disappointing. i get an error message almost every single time i try and enter a new transaction. sometimes it works despite the error message, sometimes it doesn't. but i get the error every time. i can't even access the banking functions as i get an error message and nothing will load. the only function that seems to work properly is the reports section.
"problematic app. upon originally downloading this app i was pleased. for the first 24hrs. i was impressed. then, i ""sent"" an invoice which the customer never received. next, it failed to update or sync with my account. when i attempted to update manually it chronically reported an error sighting that i should check my internet connection. frustrated, i uninstalled and reinstalled the app. now, it doesn't stay open for long before saying it stopped unexpectedly. i've reported every error without receiving any feedback."
zero stars. another worthless update. now you have to login every freakin time i set my phone down and of course invoicing a customer with a credit still doesn't synchronize correctly and has never. if you're looking for an accounting system please shop around before getting tangled up in this company. i've been waiting for that call from tech support for 5 years lololol.
"great app! how about adding work orders?. love the app... would love to have a ""work orders"" option for all of us construction guys who use subcontractors for the ""services"" we provide though."
app isn’t working now. please advise. it has stopped working. i click on the app and it automatically closes. new iphone today should work unless not compatible with ios13.
". 6.10.19  i hate it. you can't do ""billable"" expenses from the app. you cant edit invoices that have been sent. terrible. i hate it. 8.12.19  still hate it. noone has ""investigated""my situation. 👎👎"
. great app
good but.... very useful, but needs flexibility for budgeting and more reports. i do most of my work on my ipad so it falls short of desktop online version.
convenient access to financial information. we recently switched over from the desktop version of qb and have found the app to be a convenient way to view financial statements. i also really like the ability to take pictures of receipts and attach them to expenses from my mobile phone.
. love the program
welshman. love it. simple for me to send estimates & invoices from the field.
love it!!!. i am a tile contractor and use this app everyday. i love the latest update where the customer can sign the estimate.
slow, expensive and with poor support. i have been using quckbooks for a year now. it's terribly slow on here and also on the pc, the support is dire, and mostly just does not respond. the only thing that happens quickly in this app is the removal of service if you fail to pay your subscription. avoid! now i'm looking for an alternative that i can migrate my business info etc to without too much fuss.
worthless app. i was excited to find this app and, unfortunately, downloaded it. i really cannot figure out what is good for other than creating invoices. confusing when you open the app, it does not get better as you get into it, not that there is anything to get into. i run a small non profit & just found this app useless, except for taking up space. what a pity as i have been a qb user for years.
quickbooks phone app. so easy i can’t believe it.
improvements need to be in desktop version too. happy to have amount remaining automatically calculated in expense entries when splitting items between multiple categories! the online desktop version used to have this feature as well but went way with a recent upgrade, add it back please
good app!. i like the app. it let's me run quick books from my phone (gs5) in the field and it runs smoothly. doing estimates on site is great.
. good app!
. very handy
slow. very slow
. i uses to use spreadsheets to keep track of invoices and collections.... i will never go back this does so much more.
does everything i need!. love it!
solved my invoicing problems. now i can invoice quickly from anywhere. then track and record payments. very simple yet powerful. love the mobility.
. good app need a few obvious corrections but will be well worth the money when there are fixed
this app helps me stay connected to my company finances at all times..
demoted from 5 stars to 4. using the app on ipad and iphone for more than 5 years. dashboard has been unable to properly show invoice status for at least 3 months now. version 17.9, at least 3 updates ago? no fix yet nor response from intuit after feedback. while i’m not fond of frequent updates, one expects to have these kinds of obvious bugs fixed in the next update.
. dashboard is blank
cumbersome. qb stinks on ice! i so miss the older versions! oh, qb online will not integrate into turbo tax! i would never use it again if i had a choice. i'm looking into sage. the menus are horrible it's so cumbersome to move from one screen to another. constantly hangs up and freezes!!!
no employee section. this app contains nothing to help your employees, only the business manager. quick books could’ve at least added support for timesheets and such since they no longer allow you to save your timesheet in mobile browsers.
this makes business owner life that much easier. i love this app, intuit is the best period. i also have mint app but this is easier for me as a business owner as weird as it may sound
does not work with desktop pro plus 2017. i didn't know i had to spend even more for the qb license and upgrade to the online version.
great app. great app for someone on the go. chris
excellent app. keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
. was working awesome until last update. now won't log in. just has that loading thing come up forever
stopped recognizing transactions. after the last update it stopped recognizing transactions. even after the manual editing, still does not add them to my income. the same with the desktop app. the only difference is that the manual editing works on desktop.
. this app is extremely slow, to the point of being unusable. the bank feed is ridiculously slow, anf accepting transactions lags terribly.
. can no longer open app, error returned from client
great on the go!. not as detailed as i would like but does the job!
love it!. quickbooks has changed the way we invoice and track expenses. the ability to provide estimates then convert to invoices is amazing. the mobile app allows me to work on the go.
. is this app available for india customer?
. extremely slow login it takes many minutes just loading company data. not efficient for a quick invoice creation. idea is good though. have left a service ticket... waiting for response
convenient. great app now i can do the books from anywhere
decent. not as full featured as website
. really nice accounting app. loads of integrations via desktop browser. even a desk top app that i suspect is node based. the best feature which is lacking in other accounting apps is transaction memos. that £200 i lent my mate in july is useful info when you look back a year later.
a solid program. i like the idea of this application being online because many of my accounts can be updated asap.
payroll app in uk?. just started using quickbooks and finding it fairly helpful so far however i really need it for payroll, will the payroll app be available in the uk?
president. poor poor format after there upgrade...
easy to use. excellent app. very straight forward to use. the only issue i have is not been able to raise purchase orders on the app. this is very important to me because of the nature of my business, other than that it's spot on.
worthless. qbo is great, but this mobile app stinks.. worthless. hopefully they can evolve this app quickly. qbo is great but this app ain't
. this is a easy to use app and makes keeping track of finances easy i'm still having no problems using quickbooks and it just gets easier and easier . and if you need help the team is there , i recommend this especially if you have no real experience u swing an accounting system
great app. love to have access to our invoicing and payment details wherever i am. super easy program to use.
can’t upload receipts. it’s incredibly ridiculous that you can’t upload receipts from anywhere but your photos app. what if you get emailed an invoice? nope can’t upload it!
owner. makes life very easy for me running my small electrical contracting business. i spend less time writing estimates and invoicing.
amazing app when it works. haven’t been able to use this app as of late because i use a password manager and the quickbooks app stopped allowing me to paste my password into the password field at login. tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, still didn’t work. this issue has to be fixed.
. hasn't worked on my android phone for over a week. says error syncing data and rarely loads historical info. lost ability to photo invoices and seems to have lost tax settings as always wants to create them despite setting this up and using for 7 months now. support says they are aware and working in it for a week now
there are other options .... not with the $35 dollars they take in addition to % of every transaction. i would suggest another program and app. i personally would like the app to be able to send reminders for invoices but the app will only send them out.
. won't let me unsubscribe to the app so stuck paying a monthly subscription for a service i don't use. there's better completely free apps out there.
movement through fields. i love the app but it takes so much more time than through safari, enter or tab should move through fields looking forward to this fix
handyman sam. i've been using qbo for a few years now for my handyman business. with the new updates to this app and their online version i have been very happy. i just enrolled in the credit card payment processing. it has been helpful to collect. the credit card swipe device is easy to use too. must have if you use quickbooks.
great but........ i love the app but it could use a bit more integration. for instance, you can airprint an invoice but you can't airprint a paid invoice. seems like an oversight.
desperate for mobile. same as when i tried it in 2012. devoted qb online user, but this app is useless to me. this app may help sales people, but does nothing for management. no banking, no reporting, no transactions.
great but has a long way to go. was so excited to migrate to qbo but now that i'm here, there are so much important elements that are not here  bills payment stub or remittance advise doesnt even have a reference or a check #.
. like the app just struggling to get the logo in the est and inv struggle on the mobile
. i don't like to forcefully create account first. without using application how can i create account. other apps like this type providing use without login so why you requires login first???
. i can't even login, there is some kind of bug.
broken update. your update broke the app.
iphone 11 fail. can’t get this app open on new phone. was never a problem before!
. good but could be great i tend to use the app just to get a summary. would like it to have more of the features that qbo.
good app. very detailed , im no pro @ accounting but i am teaching myself this app. its very in depth and i like it.
awesome. great app! making bookkeeping much more enjoyable!
. loved it, but acting up again. when i add something to an invoice (on s8) then hit done, the refreshed invoice lines are all out of order and duplicated. uninstalled and reinstalled, still doing it. not working on tablet either. please fix asap. update: seems to be fixed now. thank you
annoyed again!!. i did the latest update and now i can’t even open this damm app! terrific ay! any suggestions qb’s!? can you get this sorted asap. a few updates prior to this lasted one, after that particular update all my company details except my abn disappeared, why? the app didn’t seem to save my details properly as i added them and it was like that until the following update. then everything was back to normal. pretty annoying!!
help. the android app is very very slow it takes a long time to change a estimate to a invoice i have emailed support several times about the issue with no reply please speed it up.
good start, but i need to enter time tickets on this app.. hopefully they add that feature soon.
app stopped loading after ios update. please fix
. trial no thanks $12.99 per month, no thanks one time will be ok but not monthly
. really easy to use
love the app!. absolutely love this app. i can do everything on my phone on the go and hardly ever need to pull up qb on my computer. beautiful lay out, intuitive design and easy to use.... i'd rate it an a+ 👍
. not for indian. can register as i am from india
new ios too many bugs. cannot open customer invoices. please correct asap!
can this app dethrone india specific software?. you can not setup this app to use for personal accounting. you can not setup this app for setting up multiple companies. you can not run if your internet connection is not working. so, this app is worth your time and money? you can try without worrying about any payment. so, it’s very difficult to dethrone india specific accounting software you already use. i have tried. you too can.
. excellent app. the one i use most on my smartphone.
yes please. great program, easy to use. perfect for startups!
best accounting app. perfect for any small business. never had any problem, never crashes. only need more invoicing templates.
the best. would have a hard time keeping up with everything without this program. works great!
. excelent software for small business!
not helpful. this app doesn't help me. i get errors every time i try to match or categorize a transaction from my bank. it's useless for me.
kerrie. herc's girl
limited features in the app. the app has extremely limited features as compared to web cant send customer statements or edit recurring transactions or match partially paid invoices.
bad user interface. the service doesn’t fully integrate with mobil usage. paying for the payroll service and can’t even use it. garbage, waste of money.
app crashes constantly. i used to love this app. the last couple of months the app crashes daily and multiple times. i’m in the middle of working and the app says critical updates are needed and logs me out. i’m extremely frustrated with this considering i pay over $20month to use this software across all my devices. no resolution or contact from customer service. it happens almost weekly. what a nightmare. looking for alternatives.
. so far this app is working very well for me and i have not had any problems as of yet
. not updating data on android
loving it. been hunting for a simple app for managing the finances of my farm business. this helps me with capturing and analysis of all my expenses and income. the reporting is also amazing. i also love the fact that i can even get more stats and reports via the web. amazing stuff. already introduced it to quite a number of industry colleagues. truly an amazing app
". won't allow me to update ""company information"", so customer invoices and receipts show the wrong information displayed. not a way to run a business, only track p&l. disappointing."
worst app update. after updating the recently, app is crashing. unable to login
worst in india. i install it after that i it not support in india can you suggest me other options for android
. great little accounts app for a reasonable price.
. would be nice if the app would recognize the info on the receipt when you take a pic of it
. great app very user friendly
easy and efficient!. the app serves perfectly to capture transactions on the go, snap a pic and enter amount and accounts then review later if needed on a computer. simple, some people expect this to be fully functional for some reason; if you need a fully functional program then you really should have the appropriate expenses towards computers and software anyways. this app makes the book keeping process easy as cake for clients and the accountant.
worst customer service. i love the idea of the app but it’s too confusing i don’t get a lot of the options and customer service i barely understood anything was no help at all. i just simply needed the app to track incomeexpense and personal pay.
sucks. stupid
pretty lame. seriously? the thing crashes a lot , but i can deal with that. the real problem for me is the lack of calendar in the invoice line item. i would love to use this, but if i can't put the date that i provided a service in my invoice, the it is useless to me. too bad safari doesn't work either, or i would just use that.
cant login. every time i try to create an account it says this id already exists. no matter which one of my email addresses i use it gives me the same message. then when i reset the password on my main email address the try to log in, it says no account with that id exist. help!!!
needs a lot of work. needs the ability to update bank accounts from the bank, as for now it only syncs with updates made on my windows or mac computers. needs access to all reports available. i had hoped this app would be a full version substitute when a laptop or desktop computer is not available.
not worth it. the limited functionality does not justify the cost. the app should be free if you have the full desktop program. definitely not worth paying for both.
. i'm getting to grow my business with this app
. rubbish app as never let's me update my bank transactions. i go to refresh and it simply comes up saying none and all up to date when it's not. makes the app unusable for me.
great app.. will help me tract expenses!!
great app. helps me stay on top of my business while away from the office and quickly send and receive invoices. love this app!
doesn’t work like the app on a pc. the fact that the apps are not the same on a pc than on the ipad or mobile is frustrating. can’t see running totals on the register, can’t add transactions the same way, etc. and the kicker is the website version doesn’t work at all on the ipad, can’t scroll through the register because scroll bars are absent in chrome or safari. horrible adaptation and makes the ipad useless to conduct accounting business with quickbooks...
el programa es bueno. lo malo que a los hispanos nos afecta que no esté en español, aparte de eso por vivir en usa que el software este en español y de la opción de imprimir en inglés los documentos. sería más que genial
advancedenglish.com.br. the app is good, but there is room to improve, such as the option to assign an expense to a supplier.
bon début, good start!. the online qb 2014 interface is a big wow! but this one is not yet reaching the expectations, it´s a good beginning, bon début. when do you add french and spanish languages?
fix finally now i can get back to work.. this version fixed the errors from the last update. glad it working again. quickbooks has been good except the last update. this one fixed the issue. we us this app for our onsite business and it's great. several times i would send an invoice to the customer when i'm leaving their home and before i get to the next job it's already paid. update. does not work again. :(
. great app ok
owner. great mobile app, keeps my company on the move!
easy and convenient. i own a construction business, and have grown very fond of this app. it's really convenient to use the app to maintain our books on the go. my husband and i wear many hats in our business. our time is precious, but quickbooks online helps free up some of that time with its ease of use.
refund made impossible. i’ve been making payment on this stupid app not using it at all. there’s no easy way to refund or unsubscribe this stupid app. who do i bring the attention to since quickbook site says they have nothing to do with the billing and subscription?
rubbish. will not let me log on just say i don't have an active subscription when i do....
. nice to use on the go, however does not always organize invoices in order of customer despite having it on that setting
just barely ok.. app has multiple issues . with page format. browser must use google chrome to get all options . called 3 times , on phone over hour each time . weeks later still nothing fixed . app is very limited .. customer service is a joke . here i thought i was upgrading to a better software . lol i was so wrong ..
. excellent app to get into your data on the road. i understand more functionality would be useful but being able to raise & query jobs and send out estimates & invoices 'in the wild' on my mobile phone is a real asset.
great. great app easy to use and all but needs a mileage tracker logbook like the quickbooks self employed has
. do not use unless you want to be on hold for over an hr and transferred multiple times. if you are a business owner and value your time go elsewhere
. i like the app works very well in the field. can slide cards input data all from the work site.
. awful. go through the web browser instead. the app doesn't connect frequently, saying the program is offline, but i can connect through the browser with no problems.
locks up. cannot load company data. does not work since app update.
. great app and can finally look at my invoices on the job.
please add a “transfer” option on app. overall good app but would like to have a transfer option on the mobile app i find myself having to login to the desktop version just to transfer amounts between my accounts. also, someone please find a way to mark estimates as “readseen” by the customer just like the invoices do. ipad version needs help; jumps around too much
. love this app, been using it a couple of years now m
yudi m.. i use this app all day, i love it.
bad app! bad app!. i loved the app... then it fell apart. i cannot get it to show current status on anything! why is it so hard to keep a good app 'good' ??
quick easy to use.. always there at my fingertips. love it ..use it....my business is now updated and current. .!!!! couldn't live without it.
really useless without bank register. the usefulness is really limited without having access to banking features via mobile app. dissappointed.
. it's a great app for a small business.
could be better. still no auto save. it’s 2018 folks, time to wake up. does not perform the same on my phonetablet as my desktop. i.e automated emails on my desktop autofill my clients name, my phone does not. on my desktop i can switch the order of items on my invoices and estimates, on my phone i cannot. the simple editing features are extremely important on a device that smaller than my hand.
best accounting app except for some glitch. it is the best accounting app that i had so far. i like the inventory part. what i don't like is that the activities for the suppliers are empty but with the web and desktop app the activities appear.
used to love it.... ever since the app was updated, i can no longer get past the sign in screen on my galaxy note 5. at least it still works on my ipad i guess...
highly recommended. it saves me a lot time from working on invoices and so. it help me on whenever i need it, i just have to take out my phone and i'm able to use what i need to.
. everytime need to key pass word. finger print funtion no use for full screen mobile phone. not user friendly enough
easy!!!. quickbooks makes running your own business easy! user friendly!
can't update credit card. i don't have access to a computer with chrome, they don't support ie 8 anymore so i can't update my credit card. so i download the app to see that my account is suspended due to wrong expiration date on my credit card but you can't update in the app. this blows and is useless
excellent app. moved from xero to qbo and couldn't be happier
excellent app. this is excellent app, save me lots of time and got ridd of lots of papers.
. great accounting capabilities for small and medium enterprises, compatible across all my devices. taxation is resolved quickly, no stress and most definitely no complains
knoxville premier painting. iit is a great app
would rate 0 star if i can. only works in trial version. bought it 3 days ago and hasn't work since. i emailed customer support from both itunes and quickbooks with no help. keeps asking me to subscribe (when i already have). i couldn't use it. it's useless.
add missing payroll  keypay. please add missing keypay. thanks
decent. great for checking in on the fly, but a few more features would be great. i have a feeling they'll come in time.
quickbooks user. enjoy most of the features but absolutely drives me insane that it doesn’t auto save. i’ll be working on a project get a phone call my ipad shuts down and i lose hours worth of work.
. great app, doesn't crash and still much to learn from it bur its helping keep my business organized
. this app sucks can not access anything very frustratung have to go to desktop on my phone its a nightmere going to look for something that actulay works from a moble device takes to much time fighting to use sucks
superb!!!. this is a great app for keeping up to date with accounts. links to my bank accounts and intelligently matches transactions and remembers previous matches and entries. certainly deserves the name quickbooks based on how quickly i can enter my bank transactions. great for multiuser access and very easy to set up. overall this is much better than i expected.
"enjoying quickbooks online. easy to use interface and they are frequently updating features. my only complaint is that sometimes when searching for sent invoices it won't recognize, for example 74, when it's ""invoice 2015074"""
just fine for a small business. if you are looking to get up and running quickly, then this will do just fine. the subscription is a little on the high side compared to sage's offering, but sage is a lot more difficult to use.
. this app has, literally, changed my financial standing. as a fantastic it engineer but rubbish at business management i would struggle to arrange invoices for the many small jobs that i do. now, with this app, i'm able to raise and send invoices on the spot!
30 days trial. need to pay after 30 days
. great app for managing my business on the go  easy to use!
statements!. please add the ability to send a statement(s) from the mobile app. thank you!
. wow. can't even describe how annoyed i am right now. this app is horrible. it wouldn't even allow me to complete the account creation process. i attempted 5 times and no luck, so i'm leaving this review and uninstalling it now. get to work quickbooks, this is disgraceful.
perfect. i migrated over from the computer version and so far it's awesome. i went out and bought a verizon tablet to make my billing easier in the field. i now can do everything before i walk out of the customers house, the days of going to the truck to write up a invoice are over!!!
good for viewing, not for editing. can't seem to figure out how to allocate new transactions.
. if you have a service business and you hate writing up invoices, this is an awesome app. helps you keep up. if you have internet, you can send invoices anywhere in the world at any time
where are the invoices??. what is the point of an accounting app that does not show supplier invoices? dreadful. support was as helpful as a chocolate teapot too ...
more of a headache than a help. registered online, used same login info for the app, and the app says it's a free trial. online service not communicating well with app and i was hoping to use the app most of the time. sigh.
. great app! easy to use and helps me keep track of our church income and expenses.
intuit quick books online. rad app! it performs quick calcs with the tap of a finger even better than the online version. nicely done!
. i got this to sync with my online account and it doesn't. also it won't let me add a sales tax. and so what's the point if i hafta enter everything into separate accounts.
quickbooks slow and hard to work. hard to understand and work. cannot pay on invoices on phone but can on computer. system is slow. give me the old system any day
awesome, powerful app. we've been using quickbooks for years, this app allows us to take all our bookkeeping at our finger tips
awful app  doesn’t fully sync with online data. i keep getting notifications about a 6 month overdue invoice, which i used for testing. however, when you try and remove the invoice, it can’t find it. the online version is fine if a little overpriced for soletrader business, but this app, which costs nothing, is worth exactly that. it’s next to useless.
. love the ability to create invoices immediately after performing service calls and deliveries.
just that little extra insight into what's going on.. really enjoy the overview access to invoices(my transactions). helps me to better manage what deals i have actively running and what's gone overdue. real estate agent.
worst “upgrade” process ever!!!!. if you have self employed don’t even dream of trying to fluidly upgrade to online. they data doesn’t just migrate over. the tech support people are clueless. one sharing my screen hadn’t ever even seen what self employed looked like and had no idea how anything worked compared to online. it’s total frustration.
waste of time and slow. i didn’t even get past the registration. the app was soo slow and laggy when i was trying to put my details in i gave up. couldn’t imagine the amount of time i’d waste trying to write up quotes or invoices on it. avoid!!!
invoice missing. i sent an invoice from my computer but is not recorded in mobile app. prob wont be buying
. love the fact that i can review transactions from anywhere.
excellent. very happy. now they just need to have a feature that auto extracts information accurately from receipts :)
great app. i've been a qb user since the early 90's. the app keeps getting better with greater functionally. i'm confident that all functions will be available on the app in future release. i use this app all day to create estimates and bill customers. it's great.
cancel subscription. continues to bill my tmobile account even though i've cancelled subscription
doesn't send invoices. my customers stopped receiving invoices from me via email. i have to send it to myself and forward to them. customer service is a joke: they think their clients are stupid, their advices are just ridiculous: are you sure you put the email in the right section? really? i had been sending invoices via email before and they all received them.
. it's easy to use, and connects with my regular program back and my office seamlessly! one of the best apps i've ever used for my business, keeps me moving smoothly along!
super. idéale pour les entreprises de services étant souvent hors du bureau. facile d'utilisation et très complet. accessible via pc, mac, iphone, ipad et sous androïde également. quickbooks en ligne est tout simplement génial.
. i am having trouble getting on my mobile app keep getting errors i have spoke with intuit help to no avail
. reliable. simple. improves my efficiency tracking receipts.
how did i run my business without it?. i do half my estimates and invoices on the go with this app. saves me so much time!
quick books online. ease of bookkeeping entries at home or on the go  i thereby circumvent hiring to data entry
. very easy and convenient
complete garbage. does nothing but give me an error when trying to sign in... fix your crap qb! followed your instructions to uninstall then reinstall.. still does the same thing...
nogo on ipad pro. doesn't look good on ipad pro and doesn't support split screen. need to be able to have qb open on one side and my project system on the other to create invoices.
. great app really helps with all my business needs one thing short of five stars and that's an in app calculator!!!!
great program. great program for businesses. great for on the go!
quickbooks online google app is a must have. quickbooks online google app is probably the most convenient financial tool in a small business owners world. god send. www.c2kbookkeepingsolutions.com
. great app
ok but struggles on ipad pro. what the app does it does well but it doesn’t do payroll as well as some other features. logging in to the website on my ipad pro isn’t much better.
. i can't believe how functional this app is. i love how much i can do from my phone, an it's all in sync all the time with what i do from my tablet or computer. it's great
app need more functionality. it would be great if we can do transfers and journals on the quickbooks app.
convenient and efficient. this app allows me to create invoices and collect for my plumbing services in the field and takes care of the book keeping simultaneously! i can also email the invoice to my customer instantly, which my customers seem to appreciate.
does not work with ios13. does not work with ios 13
. best accounting app ever
terrible. can’t figure out who to call for support. need to cancel account but everything goes in a circle. i hate companies like this.
major flaw  can’t add receipts to expenses. no dropbox or photo option. they advertise this system as super easy and convenient. you can’t add receipts from photos or dropbox. that makes the ‘add attachment ‘ pretty much pointless. i take a picture of an expense receipt but 0 way of adding it ... seriously. who designed this app.???
. invoices do not show units sold the invoices total price only show the amount sold
good and bad. i converted from xero and i am finding quickbooks has its advantages & disadvantages. i don’t like how the custom invoices are so restricted with gst. the mobile app banking function is excellent.
powerful bookkeeping in your hand.. fantastic program to track costs, expenses, create invoices and it's all done to generally accepted accounting principles.
excellent online app. if you don't need all the features of the desktop version, this app is great. if you need to access your accounting remotely, then it is just the ticket. it will continue to get more features as time goes by which will only make it better.
brilliant but.... ... i’d like to be able to schedule invoices to be sent out on later dates and set up automatic recurring invoices as i supply weekly subscribed services to my clients.
qb online app. i love it! the app makes it easy for me to check on my business, record transactions, and review reports.
not working properly after update. i just updated the app and now every time i try to edit an invoice it forces me to refresh the invoice and i lose my changes. the pin number does't work, i added it again and made sure it is turned on, but i have to sign in with my username and password each time. it worked perfectly on the last update.
good for basics, missing key items for on the go. the app does the basics, but i typically run into issues getting exactly what i need. have to use the full online version for truly running the business
disappointed. downloaded this app so i could buy the payroll feature for my new company but it crashes immediately upon opening.
. i love this app
easy, fast, convenient. love using this app! it is really easy to navigate and lets me do everything i need to very quickly. always in sync no matter which device i'm on.
very useful and easy. love it
meh. so slow loading new pages invoice templates are ugly hard to view invoice view doesn’t quite seem “google” more like a government website that got a makeover
so easy. couldn't have been an easier to make the switch to online. so far, so good
. very happy with this product
. for what i do this was a complete waste of money. . it was supposed to import all my all my spreadsheet and all that information over to my taxes when i signed up with tax turbotax or whatever it was. it doesn't nor did it. and now it keeps trying to charge me $60 for something after i cancel my subscription because all it did was make my taxes more complicated than they had to be.
not easy to use. simple tasks like entering a transaction are complex. app and online qb have a slow response when tapping things. just overall frustrating trying to switch from desktop qb to the app and online qb.
. amazing app
great app. makes life easy. one addition will make it perfect. add journal entry to the app.
. creo que es ineficaz ya que e recibido mi pago i no puedo ver la información de mi talón de pagos i ninguno de los representantes que me an asistido a podido brindarme información para poder obtener la información que necesito por lo general cuando una compañía te paga tan bien te proporciona el talón de pago
. it would be nice to be able to add categories from the app for types of job descriptions
nice app. nice app, quick and easy. smart invoices and bank matches. i don't like paypal, so wouldn't use that payment option.
can this app dethrone india specific software?. you can not setup this app to use for personal accounting. you can not setup this app for setting up multiple companies. you can not run if your internet connection is not working. so, this app is worth your time and money? you can try without worrying about any payment. so, it’s very difficult to dethrone india specific accounting software you already use. i have tried. you too can.
update make app worthless. thanks for the update that prevents me from sending invoices.
perfect software for the right companies. i absolutely love it! i have a small freelance design company, so i'm billing for services and commissions. there is nothing i need that it doesn't do and do well. i don't need inventory, estimates or payroll, so this program is about as friendly to me as it could possibly be.
owner. i can't add attachments without it freezing. crashes constantly and touch id does not work
pro advisor. the training videos and exam are not opening on my ipad. apparently doesn’t work with safari. i have tried everything possible in my settings.
. loved it, but acting up again. when i add something to an invoice (on s8) then hit done, the refreshed invoice lines are all out of order and duplicated. uninstalled and reinstalled, still doing it. not working on tablet either. please fix asap. update: seems to be fixed now. thank you
still in need of basic functionality. timesheets are a must have feature for the mobile app.
everything i need. the quickbooks app has met every one of my needs for my small handyman business. i love the ability to email customers estimates, invoices, and sales receipts while i am standing there with them. i have only been using the app for a little over a month but i feel good about my decision to go with quickbooks online.
not reliable. app logged you out while you’re still driving or doesn’t log you when you need it to. this used to be a great app but then this glitch happen with it not logging in and logging you out when you don’t want it to and when you contact customer service there’s no help other than delete the app and redownload it relogin yeah that doesn’t work.
typical intuit product. buggy, not awesome user experience. slow, lots of errors, doesn't work most of the time and no support. use freshbooks or something else if you care about running a business.
multiple selection?. hey is it possible to do multiple when using this app on iphone like it’s possible when using my ipad. if not can you make it possible.
billing. i subcribe my licence but i can't do billing ...or even upgrade online ??
review. everything is great but the inability to create packing slips from the app. kind of a key part of doing business...
great for my small business!. all my invoices, sales receipts and estimates right at my finger tips. no need to wait until i have computer access. saves tons of time and i can get paid much quicker!
some quirks but overall a great app. love the ease of running the office portion of the business on the go. this app is very easy to use and manage your customers and your business.
. it used to be a great app. but they even do not allow me to login anymore.... i did change the password so many times and did uninstall and install the app. now, i need to go back to my old iphone or lapy for my bookkeeping:(
very impressed!!!. this is well worth it. we are more on top of our books. it definitely has been a time saver and we love the pay bills from a click option. i really like the alerts to my overdue invoices too.
latest update is garbage. app has been great up until 3 weeks ago now it no longer works! crashes every time i try to open the app.
terrible experience with customer support. we had terrible experience with customer support. for a very important issue we contact qb customer support team, we wait for 6 days an never respond our request. for this incident we can't bill our invoices. we hate our experience. consider customer support if your company needs help.
please: give us delayed charge already!. a new update, and still no delayed charge feature. how many times do we have to ask? for the love of gawd, why can i not add a delayed charge on the mobile app?????? this is something you actually want to do when you're at a client, not get them to sign for an invoice every time you visit them during the month.
better than sage. so i've been using sage for about a year now and decided to switch to quickbooks. best decision ever. quickbooks is much more simple. totally recommend it.
. customer service is absolutely horrible. signed up yesterday online. found out customizing invoices function has been broken for 3 months. call this morning to cancel subscription and get a refund. they're answer basically was we've got your money we're not going to refund it. you have been warned stay away from quickbooks
pathetic. when will intuit wake up and get a real program for the ipad? very limited unless all you want is invoicing....disappointed....was hopeful at one point but have had it with intuit
shoameli. very good for my company on the go i have all i need maybe a catalog will be even better!
. app not working right now on my android. will not load data. has been that way for a day now.
difference maker. love the program, made it much easier to price jobs, track paidunpaid invoices and keeps track of all business info
. amazing app perfect for a small business
just works. great app. no complaints yet, but my business isn't very big.
great functionality. great app! great way to keep up with receipts on the go.
. this app is a huge help. can't run my business without it.
major flaw  can't run payrol. 3 stars as you are unable to run payrol on the go which is a major part of this app that is missing.
the worst customer service ever. don’t waist your time. trust my word
cis unfriendly. useless if your a contractor or subcontractor. if your in the construction industry, this app is useless. you cannot create cis invoices which renders this app useless.
. great app, user friendly and very versatile!
i like it.. this app is pretty easy to use. i just wish it allowed you to send a statement from your phone. i also hope to see the ability to add interest on overdue accounts.
. need to integrate payroll and qb into one app. quickbooks payroll mobile app is not what expected. not sure why employees are not visible in qb's online mobile app.
excellent. does everything i need & it synchronizes with other apps i use.
great service. login problems.. live this service. just got a new phone (note 4). cannot login. i get emailpassword error. i've reset my password several times and can login online just fine.
needs more... this app needs to have the ability to process statements. then we would not need to use a computer at all. i was expecting to not to need a computer anymore and be completely self sufficient using my ipad or iphone. otherwise it is ok. statements is a huge thing for me.
pretty nice. i like quickbooks online, it makes my business run so much easier. there are some glitches here and there, but they seem to catch them and fix them
. i can not believe that this app is this bad. i can only see customers invoices that i have been to in last 2 months. i use to be able to see 10 years worth of invoices. please fix asap. unless you can carry a laptop at all times which is not practical this again is useless. hello quickbooks how about a fix?
. it doesn't get any better than this!
efficient app. as a bookkeeper i use qbo for all of my clients as well as for my personal account. it just keeps getting better and better. accepting transactions is a breeze as is setting up invoices, paying bills, and writing estimates. one feature my clients find helpful is the receipt attachment. i would highly recommend this app for anyone who uses qbo.
. info lost. i was using the service for my business last year and started in march. in november the app crashed. when it did all my saved receipts mileage and info was lost. i can't even login any longer. when i called they said there is no support for the app except online. so i cant even speak to a rep. so all my info gone and i'm still being charged for a year and a half now for a service that never existed.
. zero! the app says it needs to update, then brings me to a screen giving a choice of uninstall or open. if i choose open, i'm back to the need to update. if i uninstall and reinstall, that's just more steps before i'm back to the same useless place. garbage software.
nice work. each revision makes the app even better. i did not appreciate the price increase but if the service continues to improve then it is valuable to my organization.
. adding time tracking to the app would be nice.
keep crashing. after last update keep crashing. new update came just an hour ago still same crash???!!!doesn’t launch the app. please fix asap pleasseeee
. incredibe app. pls if u can add african bank also it will be more okay. thanks
. how about an update to the other app? suggestions that have been requested: 1) access to notes! 2) insert item above or below another on invoice. 3) merchant services integration. 4) take photos and attach to customerjob. 5) time tracking, the ability to punch inout for appts. 6) signature capture...things to be fixed: 1) map link still populates the customers name in the search (this was supposedly fixed, but it isn't). 2) support for custom fields on templates 3) editing of invoices and
useless. maybe im missing something, but wouldn't the point of accessing you accounting software to be to actually get useful info? you cant even see bank accounts or balances. why have a way to make payments without seeing whats in your accounts?
great app. qb online app is a great app and it's only getting better. it frees up alot of time to be able to run a business on the go.
. vat does not work
useless. the app keeps crashing, if you’re in the middle of typing a long estimate or creating an invoice, it crashes and your file is gone, you have to keep saving your project, otherwise when it crashes, your project is gone. very disappointed, going to a different app or software at the beginning of the year, three years with this crap, paying high monthly rates, and for nothing.
poor software and worse support. software has limited features and the support agent gave me 3 different answers to 1 question. what hope does anyone else have with support like that. avoid this product
. great app i love it
disappointed with android app. the pc version is so slick but the android version is very disappointing. as this is cloud based there should be no reason for such limited functionality. where do i enter my expenses when out working? if i had an iphone i would be able to. come on lets have similar functionality to the pc version.
simply works. it does the job. would like to give 5 stars but unfortunately the app still doesn't allow me to work with multiple currencies.
office portability. i can post info on the fly, keeping my books up to date, even up to the minute. my clients can get estimates instantly when asking for them. my bookkeeper can see what's going on with me right now.
great app. has helped my business be very successful.
works and convenient. easy way to enter sales and expenses. i've had no problems with this app.
. better program than the internet site on my mac book pro! very easy to use and very seem less operation.
. it's a great program, not the most user friendly app ever but still a great appprogram.... the fees are high as well but depends on your situation if it's worth it to you or not...
makes life easier!. helps me keep record of everything from invoices, payments customers and expenses. all from my phone
app crashes on ios 9 and ios 10. when i click on support it takes you to a web page that also does not work properly. do you have email support ?
. app keeps closing right after opening even after uninstalling and then installing and also clearing app cache and data. the only update available to me is the 19.5.2
. 1 star : i have been inundated with advertisements are so much i went ahead and download it it just so that i could give it a review. hopefully they will not continue to bug me with youtube videos and all these unimportant advertisements i didn't ask for in the first place.
. takes ages to load then crashes to a black screen. i have had the app for 3 months or so and only ever got it working for a few moments once. as it is so unreliable i could not trust it as an app to rely on, for example to use in front of a customer in their home, therefore i cannot recommend this app. i run a ltd company and we use qb as our accounting software.
very happy. i changed from myob to intuit and my only complant is i wish i did it years ago.
i am truly loving this app. been hunting for a simple app for managing the finances of my farm business. this helps me with capturing and analysis of all my expenses and income. the reporting is also amazing. i also love the fact that i can even get more stats and reports via the web. amazing stuff. already introduced it to quite a number of industry colleagues. truly an amazing app
can’t use properly  soooo slow. i can’t use qbo app properly, the application is so slow, unable to load my data on my mobile (wifi lte network)
fantastic app for my ipad pro!. i recently acquired an ipad pro to use for my business and instantly downloaded quickbooks to use on the go. this app has been wonderful for sending invoices, logging my expenses, and managing the books in general. so far, i have yet to experience a crash and everything has been working well for my needs!
. useful app
. apps bad after last update... you can't easily see invoice and or estimate amount anymore, you have to click each invoice & estimate to see numbers... i will be changing program's soon if not fixed.... we need to be able to easily scroll up and down the hundreds of open invoices and see where things are, not open each invoice to get information... way to timeconsuming... can't screenshot what's going on because the update before prohibits this now.... please devs fix
great. great app
. like a bookeeper without the paycheck expense
. i would like to tell everyone who reads this that my small company and i were victims of a fraud through this app and they did nothing to help me and at this moment they put my company in collection !! in addition this is not a good app!!!!!! 🤬🤬🤬🤬
"too many free apps for me to pay for this service!!. if they are a ""top developer"" then make a free version with limited functionality for basic users like myself and a full subscription app for small business owners like your competitors do."
no invoices. not very useful.
awful. slow, takes ages to load photos, can only load one photo at a time. constant errors where the invoice will be paid twice
they got it now!. the online quickbooks works great. thank you. this app is really working and syncing, good job intuit.
love qbo it's fantastic.. this app rocks. i can see they are adding more features.
perfect for my business. i like that i can access any information quickly. very easy to use for everyone. the invoicing, payments, and sales reports are perfect for a small business. my only wish is that quick books small business would integrate easily with quick books online. maybe soon this will happen ?
. deleting your account is a nightmare!!
simple and magnificent. love it. that is all. 😀
". downloaded the app to be able to view estimates and invoices from phone while i'm away from my computer and someone calls wanting to know ""how much did we have in this job or that job"" well, the app is prettt useless when you have hundreds of estimates out and you're trying to find a particular one , but there is no ""search"" tool to look for what you're trying to find."
slow, expensive and with poor support. i have been using quckbooks for a year now. it's terribly slow on here and also on the pc, the support is dire, and mostly just does not respond. the only thing that happens quickly in this app is the removal of service if you fail to pay your subscription. avoid! now i'm looking for an alternative that i can migrate my business info etc to without too much fuss.
q books. i love this app it's very useful
freelance business functions like agency. this app is brilliant. i can check the status of invoices, p&l's, reference invoices, and client trends. best business app i have on my phone!
ability to do transfers. good app just wish i could do transfers between my bank accounts the same as the online version.
update broke. i cannot accept transactions. the only things accessible on the baking screens are back and trash. please fix otherwise it’s useless.
. why doesn't all my business info show up on the invoice? address, phone number... i had to add my address under business name but couldn't fit number.
. as someone who is constantly on the go, i have minimal access to a desktop computer. this app makes it easy to invoice and record payments right from my phone whether i can make it to the office or not
lots of steps. i like the app but there are lots of steps and it takes me a while. occasionally the transaction doesn't go through. it does update my quickbooks so i like that and it saves my bookkeeper time
. your app cannot use in india.
. was working ok then app was updated,. help centre can't give time to fix or troubleshoot to be able to use this whilst out on jobsites not happy at all costing money
. can't connect my bank account. please fix this error. i have to manually put my expenses in the app because when i try connecting my bank account i always get a pop up saying an error occurred.
great product. i couldn't be happier with this app is the best of the best, probably the purchase i ever done for my business
must buy two services. i’m selfemployed and need to track miles as well as be able to send estimates. with “quickbooks selfemployed” you can track miles but you cannot send estimates. with “quickbooks online” you can send estimates but you cannot track mileage. to me, these things should be doable with the same serviceapp but here they are not. plus, customer service is not educated on their product or helpful.
good but not perfect.. some features missing that you get on the website for example, taxes. i haven't been able to add taxes to an item on the app. i'm sure there is an option but hard to find. also, why does it keep signing me out every now and then. i have to resubmit my password and then setup touch id again.
. great, can create invoices on phone and send on the spot
. great software and service for small companies
keeps crashing. crashes on latest ios version on iphone 6
great for invoices on the go. being able to do estimates and have it linked with the office is great.
messed up. this program really stinks downloaded my accounts and it got all my accounts wrong
. smooth operation. easy to use out on jobs. quite happy smooth operation. easy to use out on jobs. quite happy.
. where do i start. purchased to help with accounts for small self employment business. did not upload new transactions from bank account or paypal as advertised on app or the full site. mileage tracker was not accurate. user interface too basic. so frustrating as i would use this constantly but as it does not upload my transactions properly, it is unusable. far too glitchey as an app. wish i had done free trial and not wasted money on it.
so good. best account software available
. why can't i see bank account details in the app? you can on the ios app contacted help desk who couldn't help! without access to accounts the app is effectively useless.
down graded. i down graded to qb online. it appears it was released about a year too soon. nothing but frustration from day one. the phone app is all but useless.
nice app. needs few more improvements
need to support multi account. i have 2 accounts abs it’s a pain in but to switch.
brilliant. this app is very easy to use and does everything i would expect...i am finally getting control of my business after 10 years! thanks quickbooks
easy. i don't like accounting whatsoever however quickbooks online is so easy to use and does so much more than keeping the books up to date.
. can't access canadian accounts with it. so you really can't get a full picture of what is going on. you have to do some stuff on the app then wait until you get back to do things on the other account. it's basically half an app now.
login' this app. makes my life so much easier. i can do everything on the go. saves time! love it!
. worthless program. i am a quickbooks pro advisor and user for 20 years. this just does not work well and there are better applications out there.
slow to load and outdated info. the mobile app is pretty much useless, continues to give outdated balances, the only report available is a basic p&l. i need to see a running balance, not just the bottom line which is usually wrong but no way to check! i see many updates but no improvements, only rate increases!
. great app helps my business run smooth and never miss invoices
. i installed it on my cellphone but wasn't installed because of insufficient storage. so what i did was to delete some apps on my phone. when i tried to install it again to the phone it won't work because the said phone now cannot be access because it's now not highlighted in this quickbook apps
. pretty simple
great app for accounting on the go!. i don't know why people are disappointed in this app it's an app, not an entire accounting software. plus it's free! i love this app. i can create, manage & send invoices on the go. that's all i need to do. it has a simple interface. kudos to qb.
awesome app, love quickbooks. use it often to add expenses and check bank data. nice feature of receipt photo, works great
. great product simple to use. great price. one less headache!
. very happy with this program an app hats off to u for such an awesome buisness solution
qb online and ios app. with the online and ios app this is exactly what i needed to be completely mobile. i can start on one and finish on the other.
. i really like being able to do all my estimate and invoices on my mobile phone
easy to use.. does what i need it to do. helps me record my sales and expenses without a pc.
. easy to use, nononsense basic accounting software that even firsttimers like myself can master. smooth invoicing, affordable, all you could really ask for. not as fancy as se other accounting software out there but then again, for a sole trader like me, more than sufficient.
. doesn't actually show invoices or customers. features are mostly broken or sporadic. using the website is a much better option.
. magnificent app
payroll done quickly!. love this app!
. does everything i need....
great for my business. i use it to keep track of my customers. if i am not at my desk top computer, i still can let them know about their order.
can't login. worked fine, but now asking me to login and then keeps saying there's been an error. please fix!
fairly good. not too bad, does most of the things you can do with your browser on pc but i would like to see the ability to update your bank account in the app
. the green box you have to put your receipt in is every where. the box won't stay the same size no matter how still you keep your camera.
so easy. this app is user friendly and intuitive. i like being able to see the reports and add attachments to expenses. highly recommended for small businesses owners.
easy. easy to use, and has all the features i need to run my lawn care business. i recommend it to everyone. my only issue was getting my subscription paid for. i worked it out by calling customer service and they were awesome.
great for my small business. integrates well with my online booking app and square reader. helps me to stay organized, spend less time doing administrative duties and more time to focus on what i love to do.
amazing in app and on line. the perfect accounting platform. easy to use, fast and simple.
. this app sucks! i can't even login
confused. unlike using my laptop to filter purchases, payments, and deposits the app is extremely confusing and when purchases are made you cannot view them live or even see previous ones, instead i have to spend a lot of time logging them in. i purchased the quickbooks online through my laptop in hopes that the app would make my accounting easier by using my phone, as i do not have time to constantly log into my laptop. the app is too time consuming and confusing.
logging out.... every time i open the app, it logs out. so now i have to keep my qb password with me. love qb but hate this app. have raised the issue, been ignored.
they discontinued this app. do not download this. they stopped the link so it no longer works. too bad because i was using this to run my business and now i'm screwed. i have to find another app quick to do my invoices with. i like razorsync for scheduling but i am not thrilled with their estimating and invoicing. if intuit had kept this up and just made some improvements it would be great!
. doesn't work on pixel 3xl. crashes as soon as it starts every time. wave works great though!
not happy any longer!. having issues logging in every single time now, very frustrating and not happy at all. always asking for finger print, and when typing in my password, it takes about 5 attempts before it’ll login to my company info. also having a constant lag when trying to inputsubmit any items to customers. this is extremely upsetting when trying to submit invoices before a deadline.
sales tax. cannot use the app on my phone because it does not calculate sales tax correctly. spoke with customer service. they know the issue and do not seem to think it’s important to fix it. makes the app almost useless to me
. great app for small business
"love this app. it is so awesome to be able to login to our accounting software and services do an invoice right from the service location we just finished up on... i can actually send a store manager a estimate sheet as a ""what was done  sign off sheet for his record in the case of a corporate billing. i am so glad i chose qb's online..."
. can retrieve the old account but it won't re activate. created a new account and password.. can't log in. seems to be an app issue or software
great for business, especially if you drive a lot!!!. this app is great as well as the self employed app! make sure you do your invoicing all on one. they don't work together and have to reenter on desktop or quickbooks app. you can select personal or business for mileage and customize trips. all in all this is a great app!
small business. way to complex and slow going to make a new invoice for a new customer on the fly
onion vs. desktop. i have just purchased the desktop version. i would.like to use the app to record my expenses on the fly. from what i can tell you need to have an online account to do so. please help if there is a way.
wouldn't know what to do without it. love it helps keep me honest in line and stress free
great help. i love technology.
easy to use. makes accountingonthego very easy for our business. also is very easy to understand how to enterprocess all information.
not pleased. for one i still can't redownload the app after i accidentally deleted it. it's been months. i hit the cloud button and it does nothing. i also put an estimate in and the phone didn't save it. when i checked desktop it was saved 6x because i kept trying to do it on the phone. the app has many glitches but it is helpful when i'm not by a computer but u cannot rely solely on the app.
useless since update. the last update brings a gorgeous splash screen. i know this because i see it dozens of times each day since i have to log in every time i open the app! completely useless now.
. awsme app
syncs to everything!!. awesome app. i'm using quickbooks for my personal accounting. saves a ton of time. intuit's phone and online support is terrific as well. couldn't recommend this app highly enough.
useful app for sure. thanks for the refresh feature, will definitely make my job easier. 5 stars.
. app with easy to use features
. great app. i love it.
it's only a trial. this looks brilliant until you've set up the account only to find out that it's a 30 trial. by that time they've got your email. well done them. clever!! immediately deleted
can't open.. i loved this app. i could work up estimates on the spot. add my receipts. it was really functional. i just got a note 5 and it won't even open the app. if not fixed soon. i will cancel my membership.
easy to use. easy to learn and use. nice to set up. help is always there if needed.
. so far i'm pretty happy with it. since i run a very small business i don't have a big budget for bookkeeping, but luckily, quickbook offers just about everything i need with very affordable subscription fee.
business easy. i enjoy qb on my phone! it makes it easy to adjust, stay updated, quickly send or add while on the go!
makes life a whole lot easier. the easy way to track you business.
new version stinks. one of the main reasons i use the app is so that i can pull up my customers entire transaction history when i'm out in the field. the previous version did that beautifully. other problems as well.
not as good as desktop. needs to be able to do more with employees and checking invoices and managing the dashboard
good program. wish i could see if my estimates were “viewed”, like my invoices.
incomplete. the mobile app is not very useful compared to the online version, missing so many functions! like time sheets and billing be with them!
handy, but needs work. the app is pretty hand for some of my clients to invoice on the go or take photos of their receipts. i find it a little too dumbed down for my uses. i would love to be able to add delayed credits and charges and drill down on the financial statements. it would also be great to pull other reports, not just p&l and balance sheet.
app not working on iphone. i’ve been trying to install the app on my iphone (6s) with the current version of ios for the past couple of months. the app downloads and installs. when i tap the app to open it, the screen briefly shows the intuit quickbooks logo and then closes. i called support but the told me to go to apple. the ability to use the app to capture receipts etc was a big draw to using quickbooks online. very disappointed.
great app. i haven't subscribe fully but am definitely paying for this...
fee increase is a bad deal. fees increased but same services rendered. otherwise it’s a decent app. i’m disappointed that they get people to invest all there invoices and history in app and program then up the fees in them nearly double. can’t trust a company that does that to ya.
why use the app when you it lacks the features of the website. you can’t change the status of in invoice on the app and must be done online only. this is a major flaw in the app. once i do my taxes i will no longer be using quick books, because of the enforced complexity the system is rendered mostly useless. the app needs to have complete functionality of the site.
great app. works well recommend for chippys like myself :)
slow to respond from time to time .. the app is sometimes slow to respond.
needs a lot of work. very disappointing they removed card payment facility, only reason i went with quickbooks over xero. also don't try and do anything within app or your accounts will get into a right mess (things like match a payment or transfer) you will end up with duplicate transactions that can only be deleted by logging into web client. upsetting the company that all those years ago changed the industry (and took on sage) have failed so badly.
100% broken. they must have changed something with the login process. i only get a message saying it's for online users (which i am) and not mac and windows users. cannot even login anymore.
very disappointed. ever since i updated it doesn't save my expenses and crashes a lot. very disappointed.
very useful. just as fluid as the full version on my pc. easy to use, and can generate invoices quickly..
. compared with the apple version, the android version scrolling doesn't work
sales tax calculation is wrong. when creating an invoice, the app does not honor customer's sales tax setting. it applies tax even on customers with tax turned off. please fix asap!!!!
really helpful!!. i am a computer engineer and being able to make estimates and invoices in the field has really helped me!
underdeveloped & terrible support. the software is totally undeveloped and does not have the features of the regular desktop version. tech support is horrific, they can't help because they don't have the knowledge. intuit had no business releasing the software to the public it's not even ready for beta yet. the iphone app is worthless!
demoted from 5 stars to 4. using the app on ipad and iphone for more than 5 years. dashboard has been unable to properly show invoice status for at least 3 months now. version 17.9, at least 3 updates ago? no fix yet nor response from intuit after feedback. while i’m not fond of frequent updates, one expects to have these kinds of obvious bugs fixed in the next update.
superb app. works everytime for me, allows me to update invoices, expenses and record payments.
love the software. understanding that all software are more friendly on the actual computer than in the cell app, even though, the cell app is very helpful for invoices, estimates, reminders for payments “on the go” just to mention a couple of them. being an 8 years user from checkmark multiledger and payroll and making the transition to quickbooks is just a huge step forward and very efficient for my firm.
. i've been trying to download the app for 12 hours. i've got solid internet. i've restarted my phone twice. it wouldn't let me submit a comment until now. what's up?
. accounting standard for small businesses
great app. very functional and easy to understand. works well with desktop version.
. more nicer with the update but i still can't give my customers discounts, i wish it would let me make a negative quantity or rate while making and invoice.
subscription portal broken. infuriating support staff that don't have a clue. actually tried to make me pay a second subscription to access my data.
great tool for those on the go!. while there is a lot of functionality missing that would make this app even more convenient, what it does offer is a tremendous help while on the go. from creating invoices to recording expenses to seeing your p&l and balance sheet, this app is a great tool and extremely easy to use!
awesome app. awesome app and online as well. runs rings around xero. app is 100x better
simple and efficient. this makes invoicing on the go so simple. i love that it syncs with my computer and i can take a photo of receipts and it adds them to my expenses. very convenient
. i've used quickbooks since starting my own business, plastering, it is very useful, but also very hard to understand and navigate. loads of features you can use, if you can find the information or spend ages trying to find and work it all out. hardly any help. easily take your money every month, but i am struggling to resubscribe!! does all my info disappear now! the time i've spent on this and the money, so misleading, very frustrated with quickbooks at the moment!
. so user friendly
. horrible. difficulty in getting customer service rep. when asked to speak to a manager she continued to argue. not easy to speak to a rep. i signed in and went thru steps to set up quick books it didn't like my information to deposit money. horrible and don't advise wasting money. sat on hold for a manager for an extremely long time more than 15 minutes.
. please update. can't login
. i've had nothing but trouble with this app. i've sent numerous error reports made several attempts to contact customer support with no reply.
slow to respond from time to time .. the app is sometimes slow to respond.
great costumer service. i hope that they improve the app but so far so good. very satisfied with the product.
bad customer service and bad app. i’m use only one month is the most terrible app. never used this app
contractor. love this app
. very easy step by step accounting software
update broke. i cannot accept transactions. the only things accessible on the baking screens are back and trash. please fix otherwise it’s useless.
awesome. this is a great app it's really easy to use with seamless integration with my desktop version. the response has been consistently fast when you process transactions, highly recommend !
ca uday soman. good software for sme
. the app use to work fine but since last month i can not update any invoice in the app. it keep givig me error unable to edit. there was adding this invoice. if this problem continues please call customer care. i have uninstalled and installed saveral time no luck.
great program. great program and its user friendly too.
. 1 star due to being conned by the sales staff. downloaded app and was offered 50% reduction if i signed up. next day get a call from quickbooks sales team saying they could offer the price lower for 12 months, signed up and looked at the offer on the app was lower. its a good tool but sales obv just want to meet their targets
awesome!. fantastic app. as a freelancer i am often away from my office. being able to create estimates and have my clients sign them on the spot has been great. and being able to send invoices from anywhere has absolutely changed my life! love it.
entering bills?????. why have intuit decided not to support bill entering on this app?!? it great i can import my paper receipts using the camera, but whats the point if i can't enter as a bill only an expense?!?
needs more bank options. this app doesn’t support my bank (becu) si in that case it’s worthless to me. please refund my money thank you!
. great app. been using it to run my business for the last 3 years and loving it still.
. great app
like it but has its let downs. i like being able to get stuff done on breaks throughout the day. givea me more family time when i get home but the computer version is 10x better. if the app were set up the same would get 5 start from me
only missing a mileage tracker. i recall i primarily looked into a system for mileage tracking, now months later i’m hooked but i still don’t have a solution. the invoicing, banking, etc features are all great! glad i made the investment, just need to find me a mileage tracker. hee hee
partial funcionality. useless for my business, i have to do my accouting work on a computer, this app doesnt have what i need
. doesn't have my back in its list, so it's useless. i've cancelled my subscription. when i contacted support, they were obsessed with my subscription, rather than the actual issue.
. i can receive money's from clientele and keep all of my expenses organized in such a simple way!
great. great app easy to use and all but needs a mileage tracker logbook like the quickbooks self employed has
changed my world in a good way!. simple, intuitive, any device, anywhere. let's me do my accounting on the fly instead of working though a pile of admin at the end of the month.
does the job. great app for fast results
. the quickbooks app has been a life saver! very easy to use and helps when i need to do estimates or invoices on the go.
super & excellent apps. very user friendly application . i would recommend this software to other people
. great way to manage my business remotely. easy to use. great app!
awesome. streamlines my entire business, saves me tons of time, lets me take credit cards, and best of allows me to bill on the spot.
must have app for any business!. easy, fast, comprehensive and dependable. makes the handling of my business a breeze.
. it is awesome, very intuitive, simple, more than value for money paid. can you add bills and bill payment to the mobile version?
horrible and near useless. often doesn't sync properly with online version, customers and invoices disappear, crashes often. basically... find another solution because this one will only drive you insane.
tremendous time saver. i rarely login to quickbooks online any more and have never looked back from switching from the full desktop version. the mobile app is a tremendous time saver and allows be to better server my clients.
needs better support. i thought this was a great app then it wouldn’t allow expenses to be uploaded, one of the main reasons for using this on the mobile app, support we’re worse than useless and could give no time scale as to when this would be fixed to a small business working on the go this defeated the whole point of using a mobile app, am looking for alternatives
. less useful than dealer version. convenient but sufficiently different from qb pro to require retraining staff. many favorite reports and easy navigation missing from qbo. constant strongarm marketing to upgrade or add features removed from qb pro (ie. payroll). very handy to permit off site accountant to review at their leisure
loads of bugs since updating to ios 13. broken links. can’t call up customer information. dashboard only shows banking information. invoices and estimates haven’t saved when generated on mobile device.
great program for what is asked of it.. great program (i use desktop app on my macbook pro). but constant “improvements “ make it hard to find menus you once had. needs a one click solution to print all open invoices at once. biggest complaint is i get thrown off a few times a week. it’s a quick reload, and i have not lost any data, but annoying.
. does everything a small business could ask for!
okay. i'm new to doing my own bookkeeping and find this product clunky and not very easy to use. issues with importing transactions and program changing dates and the order compared to the bank. it's not very easy to see what account transfers are moving tofrom. it's hard to distinguish credits for debits. poor customer service. no good summary graphs. slow to attach receipts. multiple clicks to do basic things. cuts off file names if there too long.
meh. still not sure how quick books became the market leader and they have been resting on their laurels for years. the app is no exception. there are lots of improvements they could make but they are too lazy.
qbo and this app two thumbs down.. how does such a large company make such a crappy product. basic logical steps can’t be completed. you go to summit a improvement and tons of people have listed the same things and nothing ever gets fixed. the app jumps back and forth between web view and app view. support is horrible. you can’t even move different parts of the invoice or estimate around in the app. switching to zoho
wow. great app
great app. yet again another update and even more glitches, you charge a fortune and cannot provide a decent service  i’m considering switching to a competitor as you have breached the contract that you have with me. this needs fixing urgently and you need to refund subscription fees! my advice to businesses and the selfemployed is do not use quickbooks!
. great app. never knew how much time you spen in transit until the tracking app was installed. 👍👍
. great app!
. does not work in india
". error message that cannot be fix ""cannot add this invoice, if error continues, please contact support"" that cannot be fix from quickbooks my android app been like this close to 1 month cannot create invoices estimates so on my business suffer cause of that, have use regular computer to create what was said. not good for business all subscriptions are active."
it's scam don't download 19.99 per month they took from my account. i just did download almost 8 month ago this app they took from my account almost 19.99 per month after cancel also they are robbing very bad don't download at all even no customer service to help you to talk also bad bad super bad
. won't let me sign in from phone (s10). app is useless unless used from computer
. really useful in daily tracking
great app!. easy to use, syncs nicely. very user friendly and keeps me informed while on the go!
great except one thing.. i like everything except when the app times out while i’m trying to save an invoice that took me 5 minutes to write up!! and no when it does that it doesn’t save the invoice. other than that it’s good.
getting too flaky. i’ve been a subscriber for about 2 years now but am now randomly getting locked out of the app where it thinks i don’t have a subscription! i’ve reported the issue , it always gets resolved but then returns ! went to do my accounts and quotes this weekend and guess what .... i’m locked out ... again! is that acceptable for a business app ! definitely not.
. this app isn't ready for primetime. used to work better. the reconciliation doesn't work if you need to hit the back button on any transaction no matter how many you approve before it. completely frustrating and gets worse with time.
office assistant. i am still a huge fan of the desktop version! the one great thing about the qbo is the online feature! it still needs improvements. if you have multi companies you have to pay individual packages for each company and log out to be able to log on the other. there is no switch between companies feature on the phone app like on the desktop and the full qbo site.
. great app love that i can use it anywhere i need.
i can't stand this program. logins don't work most of the time. functionality is severely limited (no expense tracking, no bill entry?! seriously). crashes regularly. horrible customer service.
. it stop tracking my miles 3 days ago and now it's useless to me. don't waste your money.
. it's pretty good but a little clunky on the phone compared to the desktop. and some of the available functions are different which is perplexing to me. at least it's somewhat functional but i i'm still not comfortable doing an estimate on my phone which is sad. billion dollar company and can't get the app right is disappointing. it needs work so that it can flow and function more like the online version.
total crap. this app doesn't work. it shows numbers which doesn't make sense, you can't rely on it. i just go to safari web and login to my quick books account. please change it if you can.
. stress free app
good program. wish i could see if my estimates were “viewed”, like my invoices.
track time. so far i’m pretty unhappy with this app because i thought that i could use it to track my time while i was with a client with a timer. i know that i read that somewhere when i was researching this app. that would have been a perfect feature. if this is something that i can actually do and someone can let me know how to do it i will change my rating to 4 or 5 stars.
app not working since update. normally i'd give the app 45 stars but every time i log in now it says sign in successful but there is no online account associated with the email and to start a free trial. however when i login from safari, i get in no problem. please fix as i am unable to access data from my phone.
excellent app.
. since they changed the app its not working properly nothing appears on the dashboard and can't produce invoices
last update killed this app. i can't even.... will wait for the next update g to then i can't use it.
. and using quickbooks desktop for 15 plus years. the online version makes a lot of activities more convenient. overall good experience
too many clicks for attachments. i keep track of all transactions by taking pictures of the receipt, checks, deposit receipts, and just about everything then attach them to the transaction. with the user interface rule of thumb of three clicks access to specific functions, attachments can take as many as five to six clicks to save a picture, which is very annoying and time consuming.
. quickbooks notified me of this update at 1am. not nice.
quickbooks online app. although i do like quickbooks online, the mobile app version is horrible. i downloaded and logged in and it did give me my balance sheet, but said i had no expenses, i could not find a way to put in a journal entry and other reports showed zeros as well. i deleted it from my ipad and will just use the nonapp version ( which you need google chrome vs safari to work properly not a big deal but a bit odd).
. some things are difficult to use and set up but all in all a good app.
great app. i personally find the app easier then the desktop version. everything is quick and easy to do. raise an invoice or estimate instantly and see your bank account balance. great.
. i love the ability to issue invoices and check the current payment status. bring able to photo receipts and record expenses as and when they happen is a great touch too.
pay attention to billing ~ unethical business practices. intuit upgrades subscription and charges more than advertised price when you are not looking. horrible customer service  unable to reach by phone to resolve their seemingly intentional billing errors. they practice unethical business behavior, but switching costs are very high once accounts are set up.
signin process needs work. i allow fingerprint signin, but that option doesn't show up when i need to signin. i enabled twostep verification and set up google authenticator, but when i signin the only option is text message. the whole process just feels very sloppy and halfassed.
expiring sessions suck. it's a great app and i'm using it all the time but the expiring sessions are infuriating. if you let us use touch id or a pin, don't make our session expire and force us to use our password! it completely defeats the purpose of pintouch id. it doesn't increase security, it's just super annoying. no other app that utilizes touch id does that  not even my banking apps.
"useless. i use quickbooks online extensively at my corporate office. this app, and what is available through the ""mobile"" website version of qb online, is useless for getting any work done outside of the office."
great bookkeeping app. this is a great app for tracking expenses sending invoices and overall bookkeeping. it is especially great if you are a mobile service and always on the go, easytouse from your phone or tablet or computer!
great app overall. great improvement to the app. can pull up a lot of information on demand. still need some better viewing of bank register on the app. also need to be able to click on expenses in p&l to drill down into the detail. still a great app, but areas to improve.
excellente app!. excellent app!
pretty basic and useless. can't do a lot of things. it's very very basic , pretty much a basic overview of your account. you can’t do anything even as detailed as seeing the transactions in a pl report. it’s only broad overview stuff and entering new transactions. can’t even switch cash vs accrual. severely limited and cannot work in a pinch when you can’t use an actual computer.
most productive app. using this app on my iphone and ipad hs made my life so much easier! i've been able to invoice my customers without having to lug me laptop around. truly an awesome app!
. similar issues as gillian, dashboard blank, constant error messages on mobile. i also ended up accidentally reinstalling a slightly different version and was paying double!! i didn't realize there were two very similar apps!! i also uninstalled reinstalled and it didn't fix issue. i am currently trying to figure out how to recover all the expenses and photo's of receipts for the tax season.
excellent accounting software. exactly meets my needs as an ecommerce professional. the reports are limited to pl and balance sheet, but that's is the heart of what you need. i've had it over 2 years now and love it.
don't bother. been using qb desktop for years. disapointed in the sasmobile version. mobile app is slow and frequently fails to load at all. not much functionality at all besides creating invoices. checking account balances or customer ar is not worth the bother on mobile app. this is an ok solution. i bet there are better options available than qb mobile app.
great but.... very great app. i rated three stars because you can’t enter employee time from your mobile device. i know it’s a mobile app but you should be able to enter time . i understand that mobile apps are a little different but this seems like a simple task that should be possible. i send invoices and estimates all the time with the mobile app other than that it’s a great app. will update rating when these features are added
easy and convenient. as a first time user, both app and desk top versions of quick is easy to use. moreover, the app makes my life much easier. even when i'm out of the office, invoicing, paying, receiving, and quick views of current status can be done at the fingertips.
disappointed. downloaded this app so i could buy the payroll feature for my new company but it crashes immediately upon opening.
awesome app. this is a brilliant app. i have all my invoices and expenses at my fingertips. very easy to use and synchs perfectly with qbo on my mac. keeps me on track with daily reminders of overdue invoices. no one gets away with not paying me now.
. nice app
effective. we love the fact that our company can work together from distant  separate computers. we really appreciate that quickbooks continues to upgrade and modify their program.the initial ( 4years ago drove our bookkeeper a little crazy) but each update makes sense and increases speed of system.
after ios 13 update. after updating to ios 13 the app is not opening and i couldn’t use it.... please look into it and give us a solution
. i have seen personal budgeting apps that have better user experience than this. here just some of the glaring issues:  it forces you to relogin alot, and it does not support google signin, which means you have to retype a complex password every single time  you could use pin login from settings, but it is useless..  it forces pin code reentry everytime you use the camera or switch to another app.
user role permission not supported. custom user role not supported on ipad. quickbooks recommends you to use online but the invoice interface is “blowout from screen” in chrome and safari and no available signature from customer. its annoying to use it online. this happens, at least, when the user have custom role, just permission for sales for instance.
. think it is great to a point. having trouble posting a sales receipt. can't get to my comp. wanting and needing more.
great app even a green horn can use.
app is awesome but works better on iphone than android. love the app however why can't i pull up profit loss statement graphs on my s6? this was extremely simple on my iphone 5. any help?
awesome!. i have always enjoyed using quickbooks. over the years i have moved from quickbooks to quickbookspro to quickbooks enterprise and now quickbooks online. this online system is awesome. if integrates well with other systems i use, it’s easy to navigate (once you take the free courses), customer service is excellent when i have issues  and it will move straight into my turbotax corporate filings. love, love, love it!
learning curve and then it's awesome.. takes some getting used to but i've now got it and it's actually very useful and easy to use. integration between my pc and iphone make it easy on the go and sitting at home. estimates, invoices & expenses all in one app.
. great app to managing income and expenses
they do not fix bugs at all.. constant new annoying bugs that have been around for years now. i have written multiple times to help make them aware, now i have been writing complaints and still no fixes. am literally logging into the app every single time i open it. i have to use this app for my work. no choice. but if you have a choice then you should choose literally any other app. this company is terrible.
". can not change most settings comes an error ""you and xxxx were working on this at same time "") tried on different browsers, nothing changed"
great customer support. when they updated the app they changed how bank deposits are recorded. it used to be from the home screen you could tap the plus sign and in addition to entering a debit you could add a deposit. they took that away and i was confused. but their customer support responded quickly to my review explaining that they had moved it to the top three bars. i’m solved! and i really appreciated them responding.
handy for sole trader. some things aren’t available on the app, like editing your invoices.
simple and easy.. great program, easily accessible. this program does seem a touch too simplified, and an enterprise version that runs and feels like this would be great.
not getting started on phone. neither it is getting installed newly on my android phone nor i am able to recover the password of my older account . after collecting all the data it says we don't support it on android in india
overall i recommend this app. i have a mobile veterinary service and use this for all of my billing while i'm on the road. it saves me time by allowing me to bill my clients on site at the time of service, and even process the credit card if they choose to pay that way. the only downside is that the cost per month lewis going up.
. great app
good but could be better. overall quickbooks online is a reliable usable and productive app. it continues to lack obvious things like an ap screen on the landing page and better shortcuts to accounts. but it does the job well.
changed my rating to 5.. i used to upload all my account transactions from this app. now they are gone. that was the only thing i used the app for. it is now useless to me. ***update*** your suggestion worked. changed my rating.
works well. works great across all devices. very convenient. great time saver. excellent app.
. love it, can do most things on my phone too, really useful for a tradesman
app is almost useless for me.. the only reason i upgraded to quickbooks on line was so that i could do estimates and invoicing on site. this app will allow me to do an estimate but will not let me do a partial invoice. if i can’t do a partial invoice on the app it’s simply a waste of time for my small fencing business.
. perfect for anyone in business. easy to learn and navigate. my clients love the fact i can give them a written proposal or invoice on the spot.
. good app
. quick books online is perfect for a small business owner like myself. i can have a professional bookkeeping,payroll, and tax service with also being able to provide estimates and invoices out in the field. its perfect!! thanks so much much quick books. trey blocker blocket tree service
great app for qb online. when i need an invoice sent out and i'm away from my pc, qb solved the inconvenience with this app. one thing i can't find is how to change the figure slide login.
banking. great app just the banking doesn’t always pull over on fist couple tries to load transactions
needs milages tracking. how i can add car miles in this app. needs milages tracking very important.
easy to use. i have been using qb for almost 3 years now and have had nothing but good things to say about the service provided. the support has been great anytime i needed it, they were johnny on the spot. i would highly recommend this to any small business that wants to take the stress out of bookkeeping.
great app. really like this app but switching from iphone to an android device i miss the expense option in the app. for the iphone you could input an expense on the app with the android you can not. i would like to see that added for the android app.
. limited in what the app can do...
ok app. missing alot of important features
need an important upgrade. i love the app and all the updates but we really need to information from journal entries to show up in the expenses on the app. it shows up on a computer but the app gives us false information.
. the service online is terrific. the app errors anytime i try to update from my smartphone for over a month now. support is unresponsive via email.
. great app.
last version have a lot of issues. since i got the last update, the app crashes a lot and its very slow!!
can't open.. i loved this app. i could work up estimates on the spot. add my receipts. it was really functional. i just got a note 5 and it won't even open the app. if not fixed soon. i will cancel my membership.
. full details of the most important things to do with the following link from the uk and ireland and wales with company number of the most important things
great app. works good for on the go
. omg please fix the lag!
. nice app
hd lawn care. this app has help me so much with my business billing. i highly recommend it.
this app is useless on android.. i can not believe that this app is this bad. i can only see customers invoices that i have been to in last 2 months. i use to be able to see 10 years worth of invoices. please fix asap. unless you can carry a laptop at all times which is not practical this again is useless.
bookkeepers or better only! too much info available to users.. this app would allow a salesman taking orders to view way too much information. it's nice that it integrates with the qbo program, but what am i supposed to do about salesmen that only need to check inventory and write orders? surely they should be excluded from the company books! very disappointed in the time i wasted talking to intuit salespeople who materially misrepresent the functionality of the program
. very useful app.
it sucks. after a year it erase the clients info. and it doesn't give you the option to edit to purchase order.
. used to work perfect ever since update it's very unreliable. can't log into app reliably. it often locks me out right when i'm standing in a customer's house trying to invoice them or locks me out when i need to go through my client list for a phone number etc. i suggest you consider competitors software until the app becomes stable again.
. after this last update the app is worse, you can't see your last invoice or overdue invoices, you can't create new invoice or see your customer or create new customer.
awesome app, love quickbooks. use it often to add expenses and check bank data. nice feature of receipt photo, works great
"super userfriendly. i love this app, as it is very easy to use even if you aren't completely accounting savvy. i would like to be able to setup ""reminder"" emails to clients who have past due invoices. other than that, i'm very happy with the features of this app."
no way to categorize transactions. no way to access bankcredit card accounts to categorize transactions. what's the point of having the profitloss tab if that's the case??
quickbooks app. last update is much better. use for day to day operation and quick entries.
perfect. great app and works terrifically. thanks.
app crashes constantly. i used to love this app. the last couple of months the app crashes daily and multiple times. i’m in the middle of working and the app says critical updates are needed and logs me out. i’m extremely frustrated with this considering i pay over $20month to use this software across all my devices. no resolution or contact from customer service. it happens almost weekly. what a nightmare. looking for alternatives.
helpful app 😊. so far very satisfied with this app. able to record expenses and deposits on the go and quickly. less time spent doing tedious book work. two thumbs up! 👍🏻👍🏻
perfect!. great app with all the functionality i need to take care of business. i can do much of my books on the go and not let things pile up. love this app!
. it's very useful
great app. added immensely to efficiency of our business and interface with customers
works when you're on the go!. easy app navigation. easy to create, send,invoices.
. great app easy to use.
broken app. unusable. app fails to load company data. waited an hour on the phone and never got help. killing my ability to invoice customers while mobile, which is the only reason i chose the online version that i pay for every month! intuit is not intuitive, they're only into your money. zero support. zero answers. zero. the worst.
low rating until the app supports chart of accounts. the app continues to be undeveloped for functions that are developed in the web interface. the app is excellent for invoices and credit card transactions if you have a merchant account coupled to your qbo account. the camera can be used in app to document your receipts to the cloud and i use it extensively for hotelairfarerental car expenses and they can be attached to invoices when emailing your customers.
only a trial. would have been nice to know it was a trial only, i saw the in app purchase option but no where did it say trial.
brockton driving school. great app, keeps my business manageable on the go.
makes life easier!. helps me keep record of everything from invoices, payments customers and expenses.
does what it needs to do. it does everything i need it to do. wished it had the pin code like the ios version.
. makes life so much easier, i would recommend this to any entrepreneur.
. i love this app more than my wife and she knows it. lol.😃
. does everything i need and more, really streamlined my admin.....
made to measure. this online accounting package fits like a glove. after using the desktop version for some years this is now streets ahead in terms of speed of accessibility, very user friendly with very good visibility of information on the home page and excellent tracking of sending, viewing and tracking emailed invoices. simple excellent for my purpose.
great app. far easier to use than desktop quickbooks. great software
. app doesnt start until i hit link 4 ot 5 times
easy to use, even for a newbie!. great app. easy to use, even for someone with little accounting knowledge.
love it and support intuit provides. very convenient app for expensing. had an issue crashing while logging in and customer support was very quick to respond.
qb online. just upgraded from wui quickbooks pro 2011 to quickbooks online. this program is absolutely fantastic. i love the ease of receiving payments. love that i can take photos of my receipts paid to vendors. simply a great product. customer support was also wonderful in helping me get transferred from 2011
does not work on 3g. i am unable to use quickbooks over a cellular connection. this has been the case since ios 9. sometimes after certain qb updates it works, then others it won't. i will be making notes of the versions when this issue occurs.
using new app for a week more problems longer i use it. really unhappy  i am missing data and receiving error messages and my only option for assistance is to use a form. am completely disappointed in quickbooks. limited functionality! come on intuit can't do any better than this and keep up with the times i have to use a computer or laptop to get full functionality?!
great way to keep track of business nunber on the go.. although it's not as good as the pc version it allows you to keep track of expenses as you make them while your away from the business.
great app. absolutely helpful and useful
excellent. first class app don't know how i managed without it!
. great app, works well with the desktop and online versions. great to have my financial info at my fingertips when i need it.
great app. i am just learning how to use it better things i would like to see is how to create a priceless
great app. love this app
. it a great accounting program. i just wish you could do more from the app with out having to go online
. no problems for me. works great
easy and user friendly. i have been using for 5 years
great app.. i am new to quickbook, but found this app as very helpful tool to run a small business, no matter where i am, at home, in the office or on the road. thanks +++++
great app. great integration. very easy
awesome. great app for working on the road
great resource. a little tricky to manipulate at first. but now i love it.
it works well. only thing i didn't like and don't like about other great apps is the persistent pop ups asking for a review. i get it and all but people will review if they want to. great app though does everything i want it to and more. highly recommend to everyone out there.
crapapp. quickbooks program is nice though the company's blatant lack of interest in the osx platform baffles me... this app is basically worthless and does not update to changes made online four weeks ago... they have light years to go before this app is worthy of being used...
qb online has changed the way we do business. qb online has changed the way we do business. we own a pottery studio, and do not have a fulltime bookkeeper. as a small business owner that employs only my husband and myself, qb online with apps for iphone and ipad, have made bookkeeping quicker. it has also improved our estimate and invoice system.
". refreshing bank transactions doesn't work. after refresh and upade still say "" ! error 22 days ago"". causes double entry after entering expenses manually by no refreshing and posting them. doesn't refresh bank data."
. qb desktop has a far superior user interface i did not realize that this is not the same program
normal. güzel bir uygulama ama raporlama eksik
great app. app is great and worked well with my iphone x but just updated to iphone 11 pro mac and app will not open crashes and closes every time please fix
fabulous. such a pleasure to use for both myself & my clients. thanks qbo.
awesome app. it's a womderful app, so versatile and functional
one man show. this app helps tons: estimate and invoice from anywhere.
intuit keeps working it but stumbles on occasion. i've been a qbo user for over 4 years now and run my whole oneman business on it. each app version is a bit better than the last and they do fix bugs when notified. i continue to be happy to see intuit continue to improve the app and the web interface. the blanking of bank account data in the dashboard appears to be fixed in v5.3.
"works great for my business needs. i can send estimates quickly and they look professional. one feature i really enjoy is knowing my customer has viewed the estimate! occasionally the ""+"" arrow doesn't seem to respond on the app... otherwise i'm very pleased. dc"
waiting time.. impossible to connect it on my samsung tablet. very disappointing.
great app. can see my transactions in real time.
great compared to alternatives. could use more options available though the website (like inventory management, receiving payments to elsewhere than undeposited funds etc)
. terrible. my bank account will not sync and support refuse to contact me. no transactions show up other than the ones that appeared the first time i downloaded this app. definitely not worth paying for the full version.
assholes team. if your app doesn't work in india, why did you collect basic data ? this app is just a trap to collect your mobile number, mail id and other basic details.
easy and effective. very easy and convenient, would just like if they add the ability to create a purchase order to suppliers from the app.
. doesn't work on my galaxy note 5
couldn't be more useful. i should have been using this a long time ago. now i can keep up on the go. replaced my word search game when it comes to killing time, and the best part is i'm productive.
great. great app, ensures all my needs and saves me time so that i can be out in the field more often
. desktop on line was great had to upgrade to the new online version ,total nightmare can't fined customer statements or customer credit notes etc. very few reports unfortunately have to use the online version due to the new digital vat rules or would just dump it. online chat is as much good as a chocolate teapot. there must be another accountancy package out there that we can transfer all our quickbooks data to. terrible
. works well. there are some functional restrictions from the desktop app. but works well enough
purchase order. i like the app it's a good app there is one screw up and a big one i wonder if it's only me who uses it why can't i make a purchase order on the app ??? other wise it's a great app
great but how do i renew?. it says i need to renew or pay? i hit ok and try to go to the spot i need to but don't see anything. smthis happened while trying to make someone a receipt in person.
excellent. quickbooks online works great for me and makes my work much easier especially with the phone app
. can't view emails that it sends, it doesn't track when reminders are sent on past due invoices, you can not offer multiple terms (i.e. invoice net 30 but offer a net 15 discount if they pay early). tech support wait times are extensive (40 min on one call, 20 min on a chat). all that and it's expensive.
nice app. good to run the business with this app
exactly what i need. the app combined with the online system does exactly what i need it to do. i can invoice clients as soon as i've left their premises, no more trying to keep a record and doing the paperwork later. invoice matching and bank data feeds make reconciliation so easy. this has reduced the amount of time i spend on my accounts significantly. goodbye sage, hello qb online. happy customer.
. app keeps closing even after uninstalling and then installing and also clearing app cache and data.
. can't create an account. fails every time. can't update due to server failure. no support available either.
great app. highly recommend this app to anyone with a small business or a business that's on the go. i switched over from quickbooks desktop to quickbooks online and it's way better for me.
need this feature too!!!!. if an invoice is send it is send along with the intuit notification. as i am using a purchased version i need the invoice to be send completely under my company designations. apart from that drawback everything else is fine.
horrible ever since update!!. this last update completely ruined the app.
. it would be very nice if i could attach my pdf warranty to every job without having to upload it from my device every time and choose it from a list like notes. but notes is so stupid you can only attach a jpg to it, no documents!!
more than convenient, it's necessary. having the app makes it so much easier to do business on the go. you can send estimates and invoices before the client meeting has even ended. efficient and essential!
can't see vendor activity. needs improvement. when a vendor is asking for info about payment, i can't see any of that info from the app. i have to go into the computer to look at vendor activity, which means i also need to be in a wifi location.
quickbooks online app a+. app is very easy to use, even people without lots of knowledge in bookkeeping can manage their small business with quickbooks online through the app.
small business owner. i have been skeptical about leaving all my business information in an external server, thinking that one day, the software seller is not longer in business. intuit has given me that confidence and now i am very excited with services i have received so far. the program is easy to set up and easy to use. very friendly menus. you can use as many functions you wish. is good even for those who have little experience keeping track of business.
. like the app. interface is great. would like to see an charge option for customers, so i can tally up customer's account over the course of a month and bill at the end for my lawn care business.
. i would give at least two more stars if the app actually lets me use my card reader, followed by the lack of automatic syncing and not even using active price rules whenever i need to make an invoice for a particular customer. please fix the card reader settings at least.
. love the invoice function on this app
binoy. easy to use interface love the app
worst service. changed a template i have used for invoices and estimates for 5 years without warning or reason i cannot access the ones i sent even one week ago customer service said i was using a classic template and it's gone and not coming back . makes zero sense it's 2017 get a clue . don't buy don't join charge back!
no place for attachments. when i first opened the app i was so excited. i have been a quick book user for years and now everything is available at a touch from my ipad. but the only thing that was missing was a place to put attachments from the banking screen. so bummed hope this gets an update with the attachment feature.
great. great app i use it everyday, makes invoices a breeze and makes it easier at the end of the year for tax purposes.
top notch program. i use it everyday for business! easy to use and cut my estimating time in half. i can even send estimates from the program. definitely worth the money.
excellent app. cool app to have. no accounting experience needed.
***** updated latest.. very useful.
. app no longer works at all. i've tried uninstalling & reinstalling nothing. i've left emails for qb to contact me regarding this and no response. not looking good for them right now
great!!!. i love this app i love qbo what else is there to say. recent update created tons of issues with ios 9.3.3 some glitches evolved not sure who's fault but hope they get fixed. i appear to get error messages entering my expenses :(. can't save invoice created either please fix. otherwise when the app works it's great one star is its current state.
. this app was needed a year ago!. i don't know how i started the business without it. mature and reasonably fixable! best finance app in industry. works countries outside us and canada. say saudi arabia
poor. the program is slow and it is hard to find what you want. does not compare to their desktop version.
. the desktop app is great, the mobile android one is bad, it freezes all thr time, crashes, doesn't work.
worst thing i’ve ever used.. can i give this no stars, it is awful, as others have said awful support, i’m not vat registered but after an update my account changed so it started calculating vat now left with a massive bill for the accountant to fix all the entries. my advise avoid like the plague, wouldn’t touch this app with a 20m barge pole, it’s the worst app and worst support i’ve ever seen.
. great app
not very good. this app dose not work with samsung galaxy s 6 or 6 edged, iv phone over 6 time now and just keep getting fobbed off , i don't even think thinking quickbooks technical support know wat they are doing i'm just left in the dark
easy to use on the go!. super convenient way to keep up with your accounting and invoices from anywhere on the go.
. switch to xero even though its more expensive. better off wasting money on a useless app. cant even save a transaction. lousy support and engineering team to not resolve such a essential feauture after 1 month. subscribe at your own risk.
quickbooks app. does not work well. needs a lot of improvements. each time i back up my files i end of with multiple copies on my ipad. have called several times and each time they blame the app developer which i have contacted but never heard back from them. poor program that needs fixing to get it up to good standards. do not recommend until they fix problems.
. just awful. i never know if or when it will work properly. i've uninstalled and reinstalled, tried with and without wifi, this app has cost me a lot in time and money. i never know what it will screw up next and support has never once been helpful in solving issues
waiting for updates. quite frankly, it's been totally useless. the app does not sync new data entries with the online database. i've already spent well over three hours with multiple customer support reps. the idea of creating invoices is great....only problem....it does not work!!!
it just works. it works well across all platforms. laptop pc, ipad, android phone. i am very pleased with it. still so much that i need to learn as i don't know much about business.
great for mobile services. i'm a computer technician and i use this to send a invoice or estimate for clients. quickbooks has a brand name which is good when you email your clients a invoice, it looks very professional. the best thing about this app is the cloud base syncing of your invoice, clients, income and expenses. it's worth the money if you want good quality invoices for your clients.
quickbook app. quick and easy
limited features in the app. the app has extremely limited features as compared to web cant send customer statements or edit recurring transactions or match partially paid invoices.
. awesome app
. great app
horrible. crashes every time. horrible customer service. move on to another app.
great app  easy to use. enough said. it helps me keep track of my invoicing as well as my expenses. great for small businesses.
can’t access. i can’t access quick books off my mobile then i am unable to access it off my laptop as well, i log in and it just does nothing on my laptop and when i log in on my phone it logs me out and says i don’t have mobile access..
great. amazing app but whoever did that last update screw it all up. can save estimate or invoices. horrible. i hope they refund at least a month of fees because i'm loosing money having to do all my estimatesinvoices at my house instead. needs to be fixed asap.
worthless. i have never once been able to generate a p&l for a board meeting. the reporting function just does not work, which is the most useful part of accessing this program through a browser. also, even though i can enter a sales receipt, doing deposits from the + does not work and i am unable to make corrections that are relatively simple from the browser. this platform provides no service at all.
small business owner. this app is perfect! 100% of what i need all the time!
great app. after a little getting used to, this app works well. we're a small construction company that works two to three jobs all over the southeast. we've used quickbooks desktop for years, but as we've grown, jobs have taken my partners and i to different regions at the same time. qb online app allows us to ensure that all bids are taken care of, and allows us to see who's doing what.
user friendly. quickbooks has saved me so much time and stress! i have a small business and tried excel and failed miserably. but when i switched to quickbooks it took me no time to figure out it could do everything i needed and more! also the customer service is wonderful, anytime i have called for help because i'm terrible at technology they walk me through step by step without making me feel stupid. i'm so happy i switched to quickbooks!!!
. have had an issue with sending invoices through my app for the last 3 days. even after several calls and emails no one can tell me when this will be rectified. poor support and unorganized for such a large company.
pants app! does not refresh, to many glitches!. poor show on the app! creates more work for me then needed, stick to logging in online. far easier than trying to refresh the app manually, i'll get grey before i can do any accounting with this app!!
best accounting app except for some glitch. it is the best accounting app that i had so far. i like the inventory part. what i don't like is that the activities for the suppliers are empty but with the web and desktop app the activities appear.
. awesome company! app works great!
love this app!. easy to use and convenient to have access to your books in real time.
easy to use. makes life easy for tracking all business expenses and payments
worse than useless. i downloaded this app as use quickbooks daily, the pc software is great! the apple app is such a waste of time, i can’t access any reports and the info it does show me is a waste of my time just a load of numbers that don’t mean anything. no thought has gone into this app i suspect it’s just a tick box exercise creating an app...
great app!!!!. very happy with the app works great and allows for same functionality as desk top
. it would be good to be able to save pdf receipts downloaded to my mobile straight onto the app. all i can do just now is take a screenshot.
. easy to use. make business life easier
bank transactions not loaded. there are several limitations with this app. but my major issue is the inability to load bank transactions. the connected bank account goes sometimes for weeks or months without the transactions transferred to qb. other times they are uploaded every couple of days. there is no option to upload the transactions manually through the app. i called customer service but no one helped. this makes the phone app pretty much useless.
great. it's a lot easier to use that the 10.0 version i had installed. love that i can invoice customers right thru email and get paid within 2 days!! linking bank accounts is is a huge plus too! ! i'm honestly excited about tax season this year!
great app!. works great on a samsung galaxy s5. features are coming along nicely. it would save a step to be able to add another expense from one just saved without having to back up from that record but no complaints otherwise.
. awesome to keep my books neat, love how i can send and estimate via my mobile.
new receipt feature not properly tested!. this new receipt photo feature is terrible. it captures about half the receipt every time! fix it, and test your changes before releasing them. a massive step back.
great app!. great app!
not free. not a free app, just trial. tfn. re: your response, like i said it says it's free but it's not free..
. this just turned into a must have app
exceeded expectations. it may not be perfect but it is way better than it use to be and better than any similar product i have used. integrates well with all my bank and credit card accounts across numerous canadian providers.
. error with signing up. can't sign up so i'll uninstall.
good. love that i can get information where ever i am. i wish that it was closer to the computer screen to make navagtion easier but it works
"not useful at all. disappointing that it comes with the name ""quickbooks"" yet it doesn't actually allow you to really do that much. you can't run reports, check accounts, etc."
overdose on ads. screenlock adsdo not like this. plus, too many ad notifications. i want notifcations to see my alerts not be solicited and have my lock screen taken over by quickbooks. what a shame.
electric company. quickbooks is the best invoicing program i have found.
great app. i have been using it and it is good. though i wish more features were added for suppliers.
. often doesn't work. customer service tells me not to use the app, to access account from web browser. the numbers you get there may be undependable. don't trust it.
. 😃snooth and always there. doesn't matter where i am. if i have data quickbooks are there for me.
. is it possible to link this app with my desktop quickbooks software?
. in general this is a good accounting app but lacks some of the features of the desktop site. the automatic email from the app and the desktop site is also more like its promoting qb than my organisation. new projectclient costing is very good so far.
. not free at all.. they take your valuable information such as email and phone numbers.. then say its 30 days trial.. you will have to pay to get this apps.. many of good free accounting apps are available in play store..
. the self employed app was better at tracking milage this one doesn't even track milage anymore this crashes when i try to add manually it won't let me set the endpoint. won't log me in on fingerprint sometimes, hangs and crashes a lot. overall its no where near as stable as the self employed version.
quickbooks. great app especially if on vacation!
not industry standard software. this is a clunky, disappointing, entry level piece of work. qb has been available for many years and i cannot believe that, having been recommended to download by our accountant, it feel like it has barely reached beta testing level. a real pity that microsoft money is no longer supported. that’s how to put a piece of software together. i have littleno confidence in the product.
no pdf attachment. 3 stars as the app only able to upload photo of the invoice, not other format. you need to understand that pdf is much small in size and more practical for mobile upload. as for photo, it is at least 3m nowadays and it took almost 1 min or 2 to finish the upload.please look into it in next upgrade
. quickbooks technical support is very bad and technical support dont know about how to customised form of bill and showing in their theam but donot show in my bill how to solve it thay don't know ..... and my network speed is 5mbps but opening quick books need time 10  20 minutes to open ... i don't recommend any one for supscription or purchase .... this is a overall very slow software
. never could get it to work, after months of paying and a call into quickbooks (who do not support the product if bought through the playstore or apple store), i gave up trying to use this software. $160 out the window with not a single useful action resulting from owning this product.
. really great app, highly recommend it!
so easy to use!. i really like the flexibility of this app. i found it easy to set up and get started with only a small learning curve. i have the ability to use this app on the go with whichever device i have available; using my phone, tablet or laptop it really makes it the perfect software to run my very busy business and life. the fact that it's online and i can access it anytime anywhere is awesome!
. excellent app
nice app. i really like this app, but wish it was a little easier to navigate and do more.
like not love, needs work. our company works on the road, and is trying to eliminate paper invoices. the problem is that we can’t get signatures on the invoices if we use quickbooks in the work trucks on the job. this is a big deal because us getting a signature on the invoices can mean the difference between getting paid or not.
ios 13 incompatible. was using this app, working fine on my ipad with ios 12 but updated phone to ios 13 and will not load app but crashes every time i open it. i’m not paying for a dud app. fix it or refund my subscription.
not able to login. never download this app. i have reported this error many times to the quickbooks support team. till this date they haven't even just looked into this issue.
. nice to have everything on my phone. the app works very well.
. wow isn't enough ... 100000 problems 1 sollution.. بتوفيق الله سبحانه وتعالى ... و برحمته و بفضله ... والحمد لله رب العالمين .. الخير كل من عند الله سبحانه و تعالى ...
best. app ever
great for handyman businesses. qb is great for me! i run a handyman business and my office is at my clients place or in my truck. i can sent estimatesinvoices while i am on site. it so nice because i use my tablet or phone when i’m on the road and when i’m home i can use qb on my computer and everything is automatically updated
. has potential but hasn't let me update any transactions since day one. tells me to try back in a few hours. not the best way to run a business budget. update: it's been a week and still broken. performed all the suggestions in the response article. update 2: yeah did email them like you asked. still waiting for a reply...
. fantastic app!!! reliable and extremely convenient
. app is amazing everything i need for my company is in the app. really worth it
. quickbooks is amazing! this program and app has made our small business easy, organized, and is the main hub of our online customer service and accounting!
. if you have to write off expenses for your business like meals, travel ect.....get this app now!!!! very simple and user friendly.
great app. love that i can get estimates approved right on my phone!
never worked. downloaded app but it has consistently failed to open. only the message 'unfortunately quickbooks online has stopped'. tried all the suggested work rounds, uninstall, clear data, clear cache. called help centre and their agent couldn't have been any more disinterested. appalling customer service. not worth subscribing. dreadful service.
app is glitching. ever since the new update to the quickbooks mobile app, it has been glitching every time i try to open the app. every time i click the app it closes by itself. it's frustrating whenever i have to log anything in the app. i have to constantly delete the app and reinstall it for it to work properly again.
qbo is great for business. qbo is great. i just wish i was able to do more from the mobile app. would like the ability to download and classify bank and credit card transactions from the app.
". checked this app out to see if it was good for my business. i was charged 7.99 for a ""free"" 30 day trial. decided it wasnt the right app for me. thanks for the 2 days i used it and was charged for. awesome!! (insert sarcasim here)"
needs some work. this app is good but needs more work. error message kept popping up while working in it. some tasks are missing like entering bills. can't find sign out button or switch to a different company.
. game changer
great app with a few refinements needed. this app, together with quickbooks online, does everything my business needs it to do, almost. but that's just my business. this is a very sophisticated system but easy to use! love it
qbo and this app two thumbs down.. how does such a large company make such a crappy product. basic logical steps can’t be completed. you go to summit a improvement and tons of people have listed the same things and nothing ever gets fixed. the app jumps back and forth between web view and app view. support is horrible. you can’t even move different parts of the invoice or estimate around in the app. switching to zoho
perfect!!!. this software is perfect!!!!
good program. as a small business quickbooks online works great for me. being able to access all of my business information from all my devices is awesome!
. being mainly a cis contractor it won't let me make invoices in app so have to use browser which doesn't work so have to wait till i get home to invoice from laptop. any chance of this being resolved
. this app is fantastic and easy to use
pretty nice. i like quickbooks online, it makes my business run so much easier. there are some glitches here and there, but they seem to catch them and fix them
i can't stand this program. logins don't work most of the time. functionality is severely limited (no expense tracking, no bill entry?! seriously). crashes regularly. horrible customer service.
can't even open an account!. i live in spain and the app won't accept my mobile number. i even tried a uk number but even that doesn't work. thumbs down for not even letting international customers to use or even view the product.
. quickbooks please make it so there's the option of where payments are deposited on sale receipts for the android app as its available on ios. other than that is not a bad app.at all. 👍🏼. still waiting for the option on android of where funds are deposited.
difference maker. love the program, made it much easier to price jobs, track paidunpaid invoices and keeps track of all business info
. easy accounting! using this to help me get my small business started. the service is a little on the pricey side but having this app is fantastic!
. does not work its rubbish app
simple, just plain works.... easy to set up, use and send invoices, receive payments and figure out the taxes.
not reliable. app logged you out while you’re still driving or doesn’t log you when you need it to. this used to be a great app but then this glitch happen with it not logging in and logging you out when you don’t want it to and when you contact customer service there’s no help other than delete the app and redownload it relogin yeah that doesn’t work.
. great app!
please fix. 1. when creating an estimate or invoice you can not add the project location. 2. also i have an item for notes on my estimates which should not show any price numbers (0.00) 3.i can not edit the way estimates  invoices look. i try it in android and apple both apps have the same problem. if you fix that the app will be perfect.
. brilliant app, very easy to use even for beginners. also has great customer support for your problems and queries.
good product. use this for small business. works good for all basic business functions. updates have made it even better. i enjoy and appreciate this product.
all of my clients love it!. the ease of use is fantastic. i love that i can quickly load multiple accounts. the qbo app makes my job so much easier because my clients love tracking expenses and sending invoices on the go!
easy to use.. does what i need it to do. helps me record my sales and expenses without a pc.
crashing at start up with ios 13. love this app but it crashes with ios 13 :( please fix
. looks simple and imteresting
easy and efficient!. the app serves perfectly to capture transactions on the go, snap a pic and enter amount and accounts then review later if needed on a computer. simple, some people expect this to be fully functional for some reason; if you need a fully functional program then you really should have the appropriate expenses towards computers and software anyways. this app makes the book keeping process easy as cake for clients and the accountant.
no bank rec?. how do i get bank rec. myob n xero do
. keeps closing and telling me to report an error but closies before i can click on the link to repoet the error!
still doesn't work. touch id is still not working. must manually log in to the app each time i use it throughout the day. this is super annoying not to mention time consuming. and time is money!
can't create po's through app. i use quickbooks for 2 things mainly. to create estimatesinvoices and send pos once the invoice has been paid. i can't create po's with the app so it's useless. i have to go to the website every time i want to create a po. it makes no sense that they would leave this feature out.
. i downloaded this app and not once has it worked. it crashes when i'm trying to login. i've never made it past the login screen!
great for business on the move. this app is a solid connection to your quickbooks and allows for quick and straightforward posting of expenses, invoices and estimates.
unable to see expenses as anything other than cash. even if i input it on my computer as credit card and i save it as such, on the app, it'll say cash. can't change it either
. great app!
it's good enough. this a good app helps out when in the road.
not impressed. started using the app because it was recommended to install it with quickbooks online. the app does not show any up to date transactions that were entered on the quickbooks desktop version, you cannot search by phone number or address only customer name in the app also. i would have thought the app would have been more useful to use while out in the field.
. great program
. unique app
horrible since last update. constantly crashes and slow to load. not to mention we are paying almost $800 a year to use this crappy program. lacks many features the desktop version has.
. very miss leading and is nothink like the tv advert. not to easy to use and over all disappointed. having to use it because of my accountant. no impressed!!!!
no ability. i download the app and signed up, then i realized that i have to be self employed
new version is much better. touch id is now working. this updated fixed many issues.
great but could use a little more. overall pretty great. clean easy to do basic tasks, would love access to a few more advanced features...but overall it's a great app. the app is stable, love the fingerpint login (even though it's still a little buggy at time of writing the review), it's clean & easy to read, good navigation. overall i'm very happy with it!
. inuit customer service is a joke
app needs major work. the app is useless, i have to pull out my laptop or wait till i get to my home or office. i would love to use my ipad pro, that i carry everywhere but the app is literally useless!!! please fix asap
great app. great for when you're on the go
. instructions to cancel do not allow me to cancel my subscription.
horrible. worst company and app to deal with. had to click 1 star they are negative 5 stars
. does everything i need it to!
constant errors. errors have gone away working flawlessly!
brilliant. best invoice app i've had
can't imagine not using quickbooks!. so much easier that our previous accounts package. so many apps and addons you can build a complete solution what ever business your in.
qb. completely unusable since 6th september update. crashes all the time on latest ios please fix this.
quickbooks. great app for on the go
comprehensive app for a small business. i have excellent experience and is easy to use with all functionality that i required. have tried xero, myob as well but quickbooks stand out for me as far as feature & function and good value for money.
owner. has bugs but no more back ups .no more lost files
qbo rocks, mobile app is lacking. in the day of mobility, this app lacks key capability around reporting and navigation.
awesome app. as a small business owner i'm constantly on the go. this app is amazing. with very little effort i can quickly add a new client create an invoice and get paid how i want.
down fall in quality. not a quality app. the screen is difficult to maneuver around in. there's no back or close.
almost great. this app would be better if it had a little more functionality. i would love to be able to upload photos to invoices or even send an invoice from the app. i find myself not really using the app very much because it does not have full functionality. it would be nice if qb could mirror their web based app.
sooooooo easy. each update gets better and better, making bookkeeping easier and easier.
very disappointed. ever since i updated it doesn't save my expenses and crashes a lot. very disappointed.
logs me off all the time. every single day this app automatically logs me out, displays a message that there’s been a critical update, and that i need to log in again. even worse it requires you to actually enter the password rather than allowing face id authentication.
not good!. i would expect that a company like qb will hire a high end software company to design their online website & mobile app. whoever did this is absolutly no good!
subscription ridiculous. this subscription crap is getting out of hand. what happened to the days when you could buy software and own it? as if quickbooks itself isn't expensive enough, and i would gladly pay once for a quickbooks android app, $125 a year is ridiculous. i don't need your cloud, i have a server of my own, why shove this crap down people's throats?
help. hate trying to get help this way, but my app keeps crashing. i love my online version, but basically i can’t do anything with the app. would make my life so much easier if i could
. the app is useless. google sign in simply doesn't work. links to my invoices still open in browser even when i have the app installed.
. this app is great for being on the go. love it!
. très bien et excellent support clientèle.
nice app. i really like this app, but wish it was a little easier to navigate and do more.
. great app. but wish they would integrate more reports on the mobile app. sometimes on the road these reports are crucial, but there is no access to them in the app.
invoices. i would like to be able to sort the invoices as they come in by day.
. please add 2 factor authorisation to the app instead of having to receive a text or email all the time when i log into the website.
. account function is good . but technical support & help customer service is poor, not responding. wrost app
very handy tool. in small business? you're going to use this app... a lot!
owner. great app. keeps me up to date.
qbo app rocks!. finally, we given the proper tools to make educated financial decisions on the go! thank you intuit!
. love this app! very user friendly and great for my small business!!
. app crashes a lot. several times after updates are made to the app it will crash after i have to sign in again. now it just crashes after i try to sign in.
keeps getting more user friendly!. the new video tutorials make it easy to learn. the portability of switching between the mobile app and the desktop version online is a priceless feature, thanks for all of your hard work!
perfect for my small business. i am a wedding photographer and quickbooks online is the best way for me to keep track of my expensesrentals and write up a quick invoice or estimate while i am on the road. i absolutely love how user friendly it is. as long as i have my smart phone i can work from anywhere.
still missing a lot.... if i can't manually or automatically integrate my bank account, then that's something huge missing. when you have an idea that is usable worldwide then you make it as easy as possible to use. bottom line: i want to be able to add my bank account manually and see bank transactions on the dashboard since my country's banks are not supported. more so,it takes forever to open
. very convenient app. can manage a lot on my phone when have time and when busy to get to the lap top. highly recommend for small business.
. awesome app and links with qb online.
can't sync. can't upload data from my desktop to qb online. i have qb pro 2009. is it not compatible?
good but needs more. i love this app and use it every day  it has taken me from doing my accounts once a year and being ridiculously late with invoicing, to on the spot invoicing and totally up to date with everything ... except receiving payments
great cloud based platform with all the features i need.. qb online is a phenomenal cloud based accounting platform (when using apple products). quick easy invoicing, banking, payroll, and report generation for the business owner on the go. seamless integration from mobile device to desktop with realtime updates and editing across all users. this platform slow me to run my $1.5 mil small business from my bed, boat, camper...virtually anywhere i have cellular signal. it allows me to be as mobile as i wish.
excelente. es una app genial me a facilitado el trayecto administrativo un 100%
. brilliant app, very easy to use even for beginners. also has great customer support for your problems and queries.
. complete waste of time app doesn't sync with the online version. the advice given by the help to delete browser history and cache doesn't work either. unreinstalling the app doesn't work.. in the long run you will end up wasting too much time on this program. be warned !! ###edit i've cleared cache, deleted app data it it still doesn't sync.. in particular it's the supplier list and transactions that are all missing
. great experience. easy way to keep your business organized.
. now, can't even access some of my clients from the app. i have sent the error logs several times to intuit, but no response. it keeps getting worse. lacking the fingerprint option to login. also, accepting transactions from bank feed in android not as smooth as it is in iphone. app starts freezing after accepting a few transactions. additionally, progressive invoicing does not work in the app. should make it more useful for accountants though, adding bank reconciliations capability would help.
track time. so far i’m pretty unhappy with this app because i thought that i could use it to track my time while i was with a client with a timer. i know that i read that somewhere when i was researching this app. that would have been a perfect feature. if this is something that i can actually do and someone can let me know how to do it i will change my rating to 4 or 5 stars.
lost a key feature!!!😡. update is great except they took away the option when creating a new customer to use a contacts info that's on the device.
would be great if…. this app would really be a great app if it woukd have all the functions as on the pc. for exsample i wanted to issue an invoice with a different currency, and the app blocked it and sent me to the pc. so for what is this app good if we have to go to the pc for almost each transaction?
almost there. the developers are working hard at making this the best accounting package for smes. especially ones whose top management actively participates in reviewing reports. great for compact companies. great for hands on ceos. please check other reviews for page organisations and their experience.
love quickbooks. we started and successfully operate a small business. quickbooks has been fantastic for us. we can see the cash flow as well as invoice, manage vendors and taxes. it has been a complete package for us and provides a professional appearance to our customers.
nice. good app for business
. i would rate the app 5 stars if you could trust that the info was accurate. i have, so many times, quoted customers their balance on my route only to discover that it is missing invoices. it appears that this app is virtually worthless as recent invoices are never uploaded to app.
stable. no longer crashes. the first update into ios 10.0.2 was really bad. wouldn't load. this update fixes that issue and i'm back working. was a setback for a week as i do a lot of invoice updates through the app, but i made due.
. i have been experiencing some trouble when doing the banking reconciliation function. every other app works fine, and even quickbooks is okay until i use the banking feature. updated everything and rebooted phone, still very slow. using an lg v10
. after new update app stuck on dashboard. unable to perform work on app. please fix this issue
easy & intuitive. plenty of available materials and support. plenty of support along the way.
. this app has told me there is a temporary problem on and off for approximately the past 12 months. this app is detrimental to my business. please fix asap!
. great app. as a small business im able to send my customers invoices and customize them to fit my company needs. i love this app and highly recommend to small business owners that needs to keep track of all of thier company finance. thank you quick book for making my life easy.
superb. the app on the iphone is great. works perfectly and great for quick invoicing. the ipad app is even better as provides much more in depth information. even better both apps work seamlessly with each other. don't know what i would do without this app.
makes life easier. does everything i need! only 1 suggest...i want to sort quotes by date created...
no american express support. we use american express for expenses and we cannot manage these transactions within the app. not even see them. the app tells me to view quickbooks online in a web browser to manage amex transactions. this makes this app very useless.
not pleased. i put the qb online app on my new ipad thinking i wouldn't have to lug my laptop around the country anymore.... it does not have the functionality or settings i need in canada. it's made for the states, which normally isn't a huge deal because we are very similar. but i couldn't input my tax codes or even my province! lame........
. good app
major problems with the newest update!!!. the app was working great until a few days ago. now i cannot receive payments on my iphone due to a bug in the app and i also cannot send an invoice via email on my iphone or ipad now. ☹️
easy to learn and use. everywhere access, integrated bank and credit card transactions. easy to create transactions on the road.
". downloaded the app to be able to view estimates and invoices from phone while i'm away from my computer and someone calls wanting to know ""how much did we have in this job or that job"" well, the app is prettt useless when you have hundreds of estimates out and you're trying to find a particular one , but there is no ""search"" tool to look for what you're trying to find."
new receipt identification is much worse. the new version of the identification of receipts when taking a picture to upload to an expense is much much worse than the previous implementation. this version hasn’t worked accurately once in 30+ pictures, whereas the old version worked accurately 90%+ of the time. how does this stuff get through testing...? :
doesn’t support enough features in app. can’t generate invoice with cis. not sure i will subscribe after trial.
awesome. i couldn't run my small business like a big business without quickbooks! just that awesome and simple!
. as a small business owner it is very easy to balance the books and to get paid within the same app.
. brilliant app for small business owners
. i only gave it a stare so i could write a review! there are hidden fees and bad customer service! i will not recommend this system ever!!!!!!!!!!!!
very helpful. this ap has been great with my ipad! being able to enter receipts and attach a photo right from the camera is the best! i love having the ease of bookkeeping on a smaller device that i can take with me everywhere.
great!!. works so well. love how easy it is to use, love how seamless the app works as well as the computer version. so easy to send invoices via email. was so happy when i found out easy it is to use!
. quick simple and easy to use for startups and small businesses
. love it! super easy to learn and use
problem with account.. website says i got android subscription. android says i dont. account about to expire and there isn't a easy or direct way to renew... guess it will be running out
took out deposit option! why?. i can no longer record simple deposits from the mobile app. i’ve been using quickbooks online for over a year now and make use of that functionality weekly. why did they take it away? not every deposit is an invoice payment.
a good portable quickbooks app. the app has most of the important features, is easy to use, and is certainly a better option than trying to use the quickbooks online on an iphone. it is not a complete substitute as there are several features not available on the app,but it does allow recording time and expenses while on the road and even allows checking on and updating bank balances.
user friendly. love quickbooks still getting used to everything it offers
excellent program. we are extremely happy with this program, it has made our company administrators live so much easier.
chris. love it!! great setup! easy. just love it!!
stopped working. i used to get nice p&l reports on my dashboard. all those reports disappeared after latest iphonr update.
easy for new users. i have a virtual operations management consulting company & use qb for invoicing accounting. i find it simple to create, send & receive payment from my clients & recommend them to use it as well.
. this app is not syncing my data from last 15 days. even support team is not responding with resoultion
great app.. wonderful!
. so simple to use i love tht i can send invoices on the go and accept payments with my phone!!
update ruined app. crashes constantly and that when you can get in. half the time it’s ‘downloading company data’ and won’t let you do anything. i find this making it actually harder to run my business.
great!. it is a very useful app however i am doing various kind of trading and i can't find a category that suit my need.
worthless!. until this app can sync with the desktop version of quickbooks, it is worthless to my business. i'm sorry i downloaded it. but i have already deleted it.
update killed app for me!. used to love this app as i’m a paid subscriber, but the recent update doesn’t launch anymore. i’ve tried removing and reinstalling same result. iphone x.
. great program to use. super simple to learn. has everything you need to run a small business.
quickbooks online. does everything i need without problems.
not working. unfortunately it's not currently working for me on my samsung s7. i keep getting errors when trying to sign in.
good, not great. you can do the basics, like sync bank accounts, run a few basic reports. but you can’t take many useful actions or get reliable search results. the bank accounts render weirdly. it’s more like a novelty rather than a tool.
missing key features. most notably, there is no way to create bills on qb for ios. this is a major feature that is just not available without a desktop. i can’t even use a mobile browser to login because the web gui gets cut off when entering a bill, even in landscape mode on an ipad.
worth it!. i got the 10$month plan and it is totally worth it! you can connect your bank and organize all your expenses. view reports and detailed graphs! even plan future investments! it’s handy on ios mobile (iphone 8). and imac.
. country like bahrain and kuwait currency has three decimal. is there any option to set currency in three decimal? we submitted so many requests regarding this issue but no response
excellent. i love this app. best ever
. app is pretty much useless. pointless to have an app when i have to enter my transactions on a desktop anyway. i want general journal entries in the app (or ya know, a better way to enter my daily sales info) or my damn money back!
app. best app
great ap. i love using this quick books online. very easy to use and it a lows me to use my ipad phone or desktop to access your account.
quickbooks online. takes a little time to get the program. but once you learn it it's a great asset to anyone's company
new update 115. the new update is horrible!! i used to be able to search customers by address and the search bar is gone. also, whatever screen i choose to be in, i have to fully close the app out to go back! what happened?!?!
. fantastic. best app ever
not happy any longer!. having issues logging in every single time now, very frustrating and not happy at all. always asking for finger print, and when typing in my password, it takes about 5 attempts before it’ll login to my company info. also having a constant lag when trying to inputsubmit any items to customers. this is extremely upsetting when trying to submit invoices before a deadline.
. this app literally will never open.
"error. i dont even understand why massage always popup said ""failed to connect with server"" when everytime tried to login using this app..send several of email to support team but theres no answer n solution..please do something i am a quickbooks online plus subscriber.."
easy to use. no training necessary. links to desktop. love it
worse update ever. finally you eat our petition to add calculator to the invoice keyboard and removed on this update? app freezes a lot
update google signin never works. update: quickbooks support contacted me. i uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it works now.  i have tried and tried to get into the quickbooks app using the google signin. i get it to work maybe 1 out of every 50 times i try to login. i don't know why they haven't fixed this issue yet. i always end up logging in on my mobile browser instead. fail
. it is really user friendly.
roofing company. the app is great, although it needs an update with bugs fixed. the app won't allow me to modify, save or send invoices. very frustrating.
a pretty good app. update: they added deposits! it does everything i need now, upgrading to 5 star! all in all, this is a pretty great app. it does just about everything i need it to while on the go, but it is missing one key piece of functionality. it does not allow the recording of deposits and that is really important for me. other than that it functions flawlessly and has never given me any trouble. overall, i love it!
owner. great app
. great app,
great system easy to use. i really like the online version better than the windows. the app is easy to use i highly recommend this app quick books has completely changed the way i run my business. every thing is so organized and neat now. i don't lose recipes any more. witch is a plus the total functionality of the system is great.
. no response from tech support does not work on my moto x running 4..2. 2. i have sent email twice with no response.
predatory data collection. the app wouldn’t allow me to accept payment without my giving it geo location. why do you need it, other than to use it in ways completely unrelated to my bookkeeping? the app was already near useless. good bye qb app!
great software. with each update this app gets better and better, great integration with turbo tax small business
app crashes in ios 13 & 13.1 .. app crashes in ios 13 & 13.1 . customer service had no clue
user friendly. love how easy it is to invoice clients
. ease of use. ability to send professional estimatesinvoices from anywhere. the ability to load price list makes creating estimates and invoices easy.
limited functionalty. the app has limited functionality, can't see transaction details of any expenses and income accounts; can only see the assets and was told to use the browser version. can't drill down from a report to see the details of the transactions. touch id login is handy. so it's better to just use the browser version.
so easy to use. i've been using quickbooks for just over a year now and i'm still finding new ways of working, making my life easier! thank you
signed up with incorrect email... how can i reset password without the right email?. email error
. they want nothing more than taking your money! wouldn't refund a $10 purchase when they couldn't transfer my subscription to the correct company file. i had a duplicate company file setup during my online migration, which according to support happens often.
good for invoices. the mobile app doesn’t have all options from the desktop app. and it’s something that makes sense... i mostly use the mobile app to check on invoices status. also the alerts ... it sent notification when an invoice is paid, and some basic information as well.
no way to categorize transactions. no way to access bankcredit card accounts to categorize transactions. what's the point of having the profitloss tab if that's the case??
convenient.. this app makes book keeping a breeze. billing can be done on the go. i no longer end up behind on my billing do to not being in the office.
. great app but have had issues with mileage tracking freezing up while i am categorizing. it then kicks me out.
excellent tool. this is great as a mobile app.
ok but. reasonably happy with it but so many of my customers are also suppliers so i really would like an entity database where an entity could be both a customer and a supplier rather than having separate customer and supplier databases which necessitates the creation and therefore data entry for the same entity twice.
perfect. for what i need this application is absolutely perfect. saves a lot of messing around creating an invoice in word and then sending it ... great app !!
forced payroll system not working. since march 2017 our payroll that they force you to pay for if you have employees has not working correctly. edd efile is non existent, cannot archive reports, and irs efile is sporadic. customer service wont credit any amount nor can they fix the problem even after “escalating” it to priority customer support. three “cases” opened, none of which fixed the problem. do not buy this product.
no more ios 8 support. disappointed that app developers are dropping ios8 support. not everyone upgrades the second apple comes out with a new ios
great app. i’ve been a subscriber for about 3 years it’s a great app ... for me the one thing lacking is being able to enter and track progress payments.
"soooo slow. i have been using this app for about three years , and it was very functional and useful, but now, almost every time i open it, it says ""downloading data,"" and stays there... for 35 minutes doesnt matter whether my phone is on wifi or cell coverage. i hope they fix this bug."
great program. i find myself keeping better records. very user friendly. great program
"not as good as it was.. getting worse. incorrect allocation of funds to invoices. the mobile app doesn't allow expense entering anymore (""we're working on it""  november 16). yes, you can see invoices and forward from the phone, but wouldn't want to do anything else. come on qb, get your act together. u.k."
great work!. the app works great and is a very useful tool for on the go business matters. i have not yet figured out how to add single time activities on the app ... not sure this feature is available. but other then that it's great!
ipad trouble. i’ve been using the self employed app for almost two years. i had some issues with crossover between a new mac and my iphone. though a painful process, tech support eventually fixed it. now after downloading the app on ipad, the app won’t work on the ipad. says mobile access isn’t available. well what have i been doing on my phone for two years then?
. very useful for small and midam business company
great little app. excellent app for basic book keeping invoicing etc and keep up with the book keeping on the fly. but to do the serious stuff you still need to work from a laptop or desktop.
. this is a easy to use app and makes keeping track of finances easy i'm still having no problems using quickbooks and it just gets easier and easier . and if you need help the team is there , i recommend this especially if you have no real experience u swing an accounting system
. simple, effective accounting, easy to understand and tweak to personalise.
"mostly useful. i like having access to my business via my smartphone, however not all features are available (reports) and some calculations don't seem to work properly. after adding payment for clients, the invoices entered afterward are not automatically attached to said payment  even though the overall balance on the account is recalculated. the invoices sit and show as ""unpaid"" even though the account balance is at zero."
decent. works for me..
. makes book keeping simple and informative.
. i was scared to switch from spreadsheets to quickbooks because i thought it would be hard to use. it's not. it makes everything easier. it also made me realize my spreadsheets were way off. a good investment for small business owners.
useless. invoices won't save please fix
. pathetic when it cimeys to app. never gives real time update. often can't refresh. a big no
. makes my job sooooo,much easier
does not support multiple currencies. hope they can add multiple currencies soon. it's useless if you have a primary currency other than usd.
. zero! the app says it needs to update, then brings me to a screen giving a choice of uninstall or open. if i choose open, i'm back to the need to update. if i uninstall and reinstall, that's just more steps before i'm back to the same useless place. garbage software.
needs some improvement quick books mobile was so much better. when any of my customers get an email it goes into spam and most can't open invoice from intuit sites. one of my customers tried paying invoices from site and that didn't work either. i don't have time to spend all day on phone to resolve continues issues.
login' this app. makes my life so much easier. i can do everything on the go. saves time! love it!
amazing app for a small or medium business. very user friendly. don't have to be an account to enter data, app allows you to do everything on the go.
easy to use. this app has been a life saver for starting a business and trying to keep the records straight. makes it easy for my accountant to access my records. good job quickbooks
". so broken that the ""report an issue"" button doesn't even work. login takes multiple tries, vendor activities are all empty, clearing cache does not help, android back buttom exits the app without even a confirmation. as much as i enjoy using the website, this app is pure frustration."
amazing. this is so much easier to use and access. we are out in the field more time than at the office and to be able to email am invoice to a customer in front of him is awesome.
"locks, freezes, and won't sync. updated last week and haven't been able to use it since. i've reinstalled, cleared cache, resynced data... nothing. qb customer service ""can't see any issues with my login"" so who knows ? ive been reduced to entering all my invoices from my computer at home (defeats the purpose of the app doesn't it?). until they fix this update, don't download it."
simple.. i'm a 30 yr old first time entrepreneur and small business owner. i wish i had paid a little bit more attention in that intro to accounting course in undergrad. but the beauty of qb is someone like me can get up to speed pretty quickly. what i love about intuit's products is they simplify your life, and qb makes keeping accurate and precise books very gratifying.
"so frustrating. ""updated"" the app... telling me now that i need a new version of the app and since i already have it, not sure what i'm supposed to do. even my accountant agrees quickbooks online is too confusing. waiting for 2016 to close out my books and use a new program."
. good app, has some minor flaws but does work in a pinch when your out on the road and need to do a quick invoice
bugs and bugs it a jungle. 1. kicking out of the app very often. 2. not able to email multiple invoices at one time. 3. limited search capabilities. cant search notes and description. :(
great app!. for a business that is always on the go this is an awesome app! i love that i can work anywhere!
. worst app don't use it. it shows us a very professional look and feel but truth is that it doesn't work in android mobile in india and online version of desktop is totally sucks just because it is very slow. these peoples are making fool of us totally.
struggle. guys i've been struggling to log in onto this app from my galaxy s6 for several weeks now, i'm considering switching to another provider. please fix this bug. ive tried for hours at a time, everytime it asks me if i am a robot, but it never logs in just hours of saying signign in. the whole point of having this app is being able to do stuff on the go and right now thats not working...
transferring to turbotax. transferring company file from online quickbooks to turbotax is only was possible by transferring the company file to desktop quickbooks and from there to turbotax. to do this transition you will need an old computer with windows 7 and ie11 32 bit. totally ridiculous and intuit looks does not care about this issue and left their customers alone with the issue. it’s a shame.
do not waste your time on this free version. this is a very limited app. do not try it! app is limited and they just try to up sell the full version. support friendly but can not support a mobile version on an ipad . this product only good for desk top computer. would not recommend to anyone. beware. check out other reviews i simply ignored the negative reviews now i am writing one.
bug fixed. your problem with app
best app for my business!. i already have invoicesasap, now i have it's companion, quickbooks! love how they sync and work together to help me understand my finances!
subscription errors. nothing but problems since january. i switched from the download to the app so i could do it at home and it's been nothing but problems, and not even the same ones!!! i have 2 companies, it's june, and i'm still trying to get this straightened out to input this years data.
time expense and mileage. great product. inconsistent functionality across desktop, iphone and ipad. for us professional service peeps can we have time expense and mileage please!
major issues.. i am a plumbing contractor and mobility is so important. currently i have multiple estimates for the same customer. it would be great if i could search for an estimate by a job name or a po. right now if i want to look up a specific estimate i have to open and check every single one in hopes i find the right quote. need a better reference system to look up estimates and invoices.
great app. i'm a technology consultant and really appreciate the flexibility this app affords for invoicing clients and getting paid on the spot.
"buggy, rough, glitchy. frequently disconnectswon't sync to my companies data. frequently ""has trouble emailing this form"" when i try to send clients invoices. frequently is unable to save invoices. using 4g lte network and wifi with same results. says i'm offline when connected to wifi and network. only way to solve problems is seemingly to uninstall and reinstall app. update: now app frequently won't create pdf's that i can then print out. absolutely horrible for mobile business convenience."
. absolutely the worst. they cost us $3,450 that a customer sent to us as a payment. they held the money from us and them. an the rep was so happy, they even closed down our account. sad
perfect app for any small business owner. as a qbo pro advisor my opinion may be somewhat biased but i can not brag enough about the software, customer support and resources offered by quickbooksintuit. qbo has allowed me to become a completely virtual bookkeeping firm, increasing my service area, customer satisfaction and turn around time. love love love them!!
useless. this app is useless because if you have an online account with mac or pc you cannot use this app on your ipad! save your time, don't download it.
don't bother. been using qb desktop for years. disapointed in the sasmobile version. mobile app is slow and frequently fails to load at all. not much functionality at all besides creating invoices. checking account balances or customer ar is not worth the bother on mobile app. this is an ok solution. i bet there are better options available than qb mobile app.
best app ever. it works awesome i recommended 100%
useful app. adds a lot of useful abilities to your mobile device. i'm not a heavy user of it, but i have not had issues with it for months using the basic features.
great app. this app  software really saves my life.
. app is crashing on login. i cannot access my business now.
. i can not believe that this app is this bad. i can only see customers invoices that i have been to in last 2 months. i use to be able to see 10 years worth of invoices. please fix asap. unless you can carry a laptop at all times which is not practical this again is useless. hello quickbooks how about a fix?
app needs major work. the app is useless, i have to pull out my laptop or wait till i get to my home or office. i would love to use my ipad pro, that i carry everywhere but the app is literally useless!!! please fix asap
. simple and easy to use
. so far i haven't enjoyed this app. you can't scan a receipt with details auto uploading but you can on the selfemployed version and also had no luck at uploading a file into an expense when manually loading details from a receipt.
they just keep changing the app.. my biggest complaint about the app is the limited features on customer entries. the pc version you can enter a customer as tax exempt on the phone you can't. further if you open the customer information on the phone and save it it will clear the tax exempt status on the pc version as well. so it is a constant battle to keep who is and isn't exempt straight.
very nice!. i love have this power in my phone! i can email invoices or print them out, all on my phone! this app is easy to learn and soooooo fast when you get used to it. there was a lot of thinking when they designed this app, wow
. it sucks scam!!! so i tried quickbooks just for hel,p i got logged out of the app and now i have to pay $400 just to restart my password other companies are free.
business on the go. if i could pay my gst from the app it would be perfect
horrible app.. when the app is down more than few times a month, it's not convenient especially when you have to hand write the invoice and than redo on qb later on , it's frustrating when this becomes an every week story.
quickbooks online. great app. saves having to cart round invoice pads.
crash crash crash. it used to work but now it crashes right when i try to open it.
great small business tool. excellent on a laptop, dient handel banks with authentication dongles very well, mobile app doesn't handle them at all. can't do payroll from mobile. receipt tracking is easy and works well. reports and snap shots handy.
. great app!
. still learning the ins and outs of the app, but so far i love
good luck getting any tech support when you need it. not impressed! what a joke. don’t waste your time here.
. piada! além de não sair da tela de cadastro inicial, a galera só fala em problemas relacionados a pagamento nao devolvido e mal funcionamento. o apelo é extraordinário e carente aqui no playstore, mas esse aqui tá ferrado!
. disappointed...like horribly disappointed! this was supposed to make my life easier but instead i lost multiple hours either trying to figure the desktop version out to then trying the app and the tax rate were getting doubled...while chatting with help desk to be told that it would get fix a week after still didn't fix. uninstalled to try to start fresh to realize the price had gone up! chatted again with customer service to be told someone would contact me within 2 hours...still waiting!
. easy to navigate
release ios 13 update now. i pay way too much money, and it’s going up in october, for you not to have an update day one ios 13 is released. you guys are always behind with the bugs. i cant even click on a customer, save an invoice, send an email etc. give me what i’m paying for.
best mobile accounting app. great improvements in the latest version. easily the best ipadiphone app for accounting, that sits well alongside the full featured qbo software.
. fix sales tax to enable for existing customers!
ios 13 incompatible. was using this app, working fine on my ipad with ios 12 but updated phone to ios 13 and will not load app but crashes every time i open it. i’m not paying for a dud app. fix it or refund my subscription.
good but could be better. i mainly use browser based interface while this android app syncs well to give me a quick overview when i'm out and around. but i do miss the features like overview money bar and bank feed. hope these can be added in the near future. from a qboa australia user.
. great app.
dashboard is broken. app needs work.. the app dashboard appears to throw up numbers completely unrelated to reality and almost always reports inability to retrieve all data. the web version, on the other hand, works fine. it seems not much attention has been put into app development. disappointing.
. ne fonctionne plus depuis hier
made my life easier. i use to spend all weekend doing paper work and now i do it as i go in the car.
great for start ups. i am wanting to know if it has been considered for users to use their finger print as an option other than the password to sign in on the app?
"don't bother. it says above ""get full access to everything quickbooks online has on the web"". but in fact it is a totally different application geared to salesmen on the road. don't expect to see your accounts here, all you have is:  customers  estimates  your invoices and sales receipts. very disappointing; forget it"
. love it, it makes my life easier.
. really, no way to tell a bank account to go get updates? i wasted my time downloading and using this app.
. i have been using this app for a year now, it helps me keep up with all my recipts and invocies for my cleaning business.
. we went from pro 2012 to the online version it easy and the android app works very well i can now run my business from under a fishing brolly if i want a day out,! updated, one thing that needs looking at is a ' restore' point i made a mistake and deleted a file with no back up available! can we have a back up please?
great. app
. it is a good program
. great app once you get logged in. repeatedly returns to login screen after entering correct password when using google login.
complete waste of time.. 100% completely useless and a total embarrassment. in the year 2013 quickbooks is the only company left that cannot figure out how to make their full product work on an ipad. please fire your entire tech department and hire a high school kid with skills.
still no touch id. i used to think this was a great app, but now with these last 2 updates, i have to constantly uninstall the app and still no touch id. why when something works fine can you not just let it be. please fix back
. works well and great support thanks!
locks up. cannot load company data. does not work since app update.
. great app! still learning, saves so much time.
. app is very convenient to use but remains shy of all the features that exist on the online web platform. keep up the good work.
app crashes. this app crashes or cannot save my data on every entry i make. horrible app!!
doesn’t let you do self assessment tax. this app only does my business tax return, and whilst it doesn’t explicitly promise more, because it doesn’t let me do my self assessment (buy to let) it means i still need another app to do this. and an account on top. being such a major tax app, the fact it can’t deal with all my tax matters is a major fail.
impossible to print packing slip from app?. i would give quickbooks a 5 if it wasn’t so dang hard to print a packing slip from my phone either through the app or quickbooks online. ugh.
bad update. can no longer accept credit card payments. keep getting error code 6000. tech support advised this is a known issue but no eta on fix. please revert back to previous version.
. this software is extremely easy to use and worth the subscription. i started my business last october and i have no interest in switching. cheers apollo butler c.e.oowner of hornet waste management.
. this is what happens when a company gets too large. first app worked fine and then suddenly refuses to connect to my bank. customer service is a joke. reps were unable to figure out why error 103 kept appearing. after two hours on the phone i was then told it is a systems issue that needs its own ticket. two days later an email arrives stating that the issue is resolved. guess what, it wasn't!! come up intuit! you can do better than this
excellent!!. does everything it's supposed to
affordable truck repair inc.. great app, makes it very easy for us to keep track of our books.
qb makes me look good. qb app is fantastic. i can write and present an estimate right at the job site or give my customer an invoice, or accept payment. in brief....it makes me look good!
. great app was worried about using it but it so easy
excellent customer support.. features wise need lot of improvement. still giving four stars because of excellent customer support.
amazing. i haven't seen smart accounting software like this 👍🏼
this app rocks!.
thomas storey. i downloaded quickbooks online to my tablet. i have used it once to get out a quick invoice. for some reason i can't download it to my phone through google play. is there a different way to get the app?
great app for small business owners!. i have a handyman business and this app made the paperwork side of the business easy!! i definitely recommend
cis deductions on apps!. unable to do a cis invoice on the app.. massive let down as this is not a feature yet
more harmonisation needed.. i find myself, more often than not, logging in to the desktop version. bank updates are very “hit and miss” particularly early morning.
. awesome app
new to qb on line. brilliant package but did need support on getting the data i migrated over sorted. but worth the monthly charges. great job quick books.
can’t paste password. when i try to log in i can’t paste my 32 character password from the clipboard. this is a frequent frustration due to how often i have to log into the quickbooks app combined with my desire to use long, complex passwords that i store in a password safe. please fix this issue asap.
. user friendly
. well after the experience so far it's great when i need to merge all apps at home then i can rate better. customer service has been just awesome so far. thanks it makes tracking expenses easy as taking a picture and putting the irs info in.
. it wont open. keeps playing up and wont let me cancel my subscription
valuable tool to have in the field. i installed the app, imported company files from my desktop and boom i was doing estimates and invoices in the field.
. since the most recent update i cannot see my dashboard or add expenses to my company. fix it. done all diagnostic steps so this update is invalid. galaxy s10+ here
. this company is a joke they will not allow hempbased transactions it is preventing my freedom of doing business the fed has mandated banks take money on hemp transactions
beware!. beware quickbooks is not software it’s ransomware. they force you to upgrade every two years and the price of the upgrade is the same price as a new one.
to complicated. don’t know how to get the max out of this app
dissapointed. this is the frontline of my business as i am a mobil service technician. app no longer will save or complete an invoice. this is crippling my business! fixxxxxx please immediately!
please fix. we use quickbooks constantly. it has enabled us to grow at a much faster rate, helped us keep our books in order, and allows us to take online payments easily. however, the recent update has been causing the app to close unexpectedly and also has many other glitches. please fix intuit. we are not hating on quickbooks, but this is the worst update we have ever seen.
. great app
money grabber. quickbooks will offer subscription service. i paid for it because of the discount and then they didnt allow me to accept payments through their app. you have to assess the profile first before asking for payment.
payroll. it is worthless for me. uninstalled it as soon as it was installed. can't do payroll.
signature issues. the app crashes every time i get a signature or it doesn't save the signature. please resolve this issue. it has now been a week and this is still an issue.
. i do not see an option for entering bills from my suppliers. i have to do bill entry from desktop. also how do i issue purchase orders from this app
update is horrible!. i've been using qb online app for a long time. and it seem like the app finally had started to improve and now this latest update has caused some great frustration. i do not recommend updating totally get these glitches resolved.
. i only give 5 stars if the app gives me free food.
not bad however. could we have a fingerprint scan to open the app as a measure of security please!!!
. app doesn't want to update. i need to use it now not later. this is unacceptable.
. i can't use it on mi note 5 pro. giving error
limited functionality, issues signing on, given up.... i have tried to use the app for sometime but find the functionality limited and not sufficient to be practical. in recent weeks i have had an issue switching clients which support has been unable to resolve. i am deleting the app & will use the web version.
great for on the go. it helps me send my customers invoices while i'm in the field
. i like the service and how quick invoices are sent to claims
. very easy to use on any device at any time. customer support is on it quickly when you contact them.
made my job way easier. been really useful for creating invoices and collecting payments for our company!
works but needs work. for the most part the product works, but has many errors and sometimes says there are errors but they are never fixed, i run the lasted ios on an iphone 6 and still have many problems
still no touch id. i used to think this was a great app, but now with these last 2 updates, i have to constantly uninstall the app and still no touch id. why when something works fine can you not just let it be.
. great app, much easier to invoice customers.
cant update billing info in app. slow, awkward layout, intelligent prefill of categories usually incorrect slowing down workflow. will be using moyob to set up accounts for my next fy.
great, but can learn from others. just my observations: mobile app should be mostly used to record expenses. it lacks ocr tracing. moreover scanning a receipt is a multistep process. should add forcetouch to add receipt (open in camera). invoices: been searching how to add my banking information. cannot believe quickbooks does not allow for adding banking information to invoices. did i miss something? or is it a hidden feature? not very intuitive (pun intended). otherwise good. like the integration with bank account.
. useful and handy
. great product easy to use and understand. not complicated at all make changes view reports and see everything clearly.
. i do invoices and print from my recliner. love this app. and sometimes generate estimates minutes after finishing my work before leaving the clients home. very convenient !!
ok... like seriously. i’ve used this app for 2019 mileage and expense tracking. but every week i have to reconnect my bank account. like every single week! why?? i don’t have time to do that. fix this! or i’ll be forced to find a better working service!
. this app is very useful for preparing and sending quotes and invoices on the go. so if i'm out of the office for the day, i can get work done.
. works well. can create invoice and estimates on the go.
. lacking critical features. you have to manually track down and cut and paste the customers email address when sending a reminder for an overdue invoice. to top that off, there is no audit log. there is absolutely no way to see when an invoice was sent, reminders sent, who it was sent to, etc. this app is worthless to small business owners who work on the go.
can't save an invoice since update.. please fix asap. i use to use this app everyday and now i can't. i love quickbooks but this is bad!!
. input all your expenses for your taxes and not have to worry about keeping all your receipts
c'mon, you know you need it. subscribe already. better than zoho or jobber. very organized and useful. such a time saver and it makes my company look 5 times more professional. recommended!
owner. this application and online service is the best i have ever used. it keeps me up to date with all book keeping. the reports it provide makes doing taxes a synch. the only thing i haven't mastered is tracking all jobs separately. if i can get this program to give me a report identifying what the profit was on each job that would help tremendously. i am fairly a new user about 2 years off and on. other than that, i give this app
keep crashing. after last update keep crashing i can't create and send my invoice please fix asap
. my app has stopped working on my samsung s9 for 2 days in a row. you should have sent an email to inform subscribers if your app is going to be experiencing a downtime.
. very handy
"best app tool for small business. i love everything about it. just please change when emailing estimate, remove ""please pay"" and change to total estimate as it is only estimate and not an invoice."
. app looks great.
horrible accounting program. barely an accounting program. one would think qb would create an online version mirroring their desktop software. navigating the online software is a headache, let alone using it for basic accounting purposes. of course qb ever improving their software is as likely to happen as me winning the lottery.
fab. brilliant app that updates instantly, giving a visual handle on your business at any time. thank you
missing a lot of functionality. big disappointment from regular quickbooks. both qbo and quickbooks app have a lot to be desired. they both lack ability to make custom fields in customer database. cannot make deposits or see the check register via the app. the big hype was to be able to access quickbooks from any device. sure enough you get access but you can't do much with it so what a waste.
. easy to navigate very helpful
no more ios 8 support. disappointed that app developers are dropping ios8 support. not everyone upgrades the second apple comes out with a new ios
bad customer service. they are not helpful. they made a mistake to deactivated my account, after my complaint, they asked me to key in every single invoice again. this is unacceptable.
poor compatibility. online version does not work with safari. quickbooks refused a refund stating it is not there issue. avoid and just get a good account
excellent app. keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
invoice and estimates not saving after last update. you will have to delete app. then reinstall then it will save.
brilliant mobile app. it has changed my life . i am able to do quotes in the run and save so much valuable time .
quickbooks. this app is excellent and the version on my computer is even better save's me hours when quoting well worth the money.
. does not work with marshmallow 6.0
great app but. i have been using the desktop 2012 version and have been used to navigating that. the online version would do well to have a more compatible and similar version for experienced users.
lacking bank register. i don't really touch the other features, i'm solely interested in coding bank transactions when i have a few minutes spare. cannot be done via this app.
. changed my work style this app changed my work style. now i can handle my accounts from any where in world. love this
what a great app!!. it's easy to understand and use, just as easy as it is online. have had no problems so far 👍
. much better than another accounting app that also ends in 'books'. works fine for me
app crashing multiple devices (ios 10 & ios 11). i use this app for my business and after the last update the app has been completely useless on my ipad and on my phone. the only way i can log data is by sitting at my computer when i get home from work. please fix asap. using freshbooks until then. thanks.
. useless wont connect to hsbc to import transactions, then locks you out of internet banking very stressful wouldn't recomend.
crashes every time. when app is installed i can log in to my account. then the app says « downloading data » and when download is complete it crashes. if i open it again (so still logged in), i cant even get past the launch screen.
great app. i haven't learnt all the features yet. but, it's worth every penny.
. great app makes my life much easier.
pathetic. so i have quickbooks, a banking transaction fails, they straight away stop you from using quickbooks, what a unprofessional outfit this is.
doesn’t mirror quickbooks online. it’s good for looking up customer info like what they owe or phone numbers. if you create an invoice online you may not be able to edit it on the phone. and if you use quickbooks for time tracking the feature doesn’t seem to be in the cards for the mobile app.
it's very nice app. nice aap, now i can mange company whole activity
i love quickbooks online. i love quickbooks online & my accountant does also. this app is really good for doing your expenses on but as far as invoicing i still do it on the computer. it's very handy for a small business. the fact you can enter an expense, take a picture of the receipt & go on your merry way. i'm sold.
amazing. east, fast and quick to learn. highly recommended
quickbooks online. works well once you get use to the change from the desktop program.
. awesome app this helped me increase my efficiency by a big margin
expenses tab stopped working. please fix the expenses tab. it's greyed out on this version and i can't use it.
. this app doesn't allow me to sign in, so it's been useless.
looks great!!!. keep the updates coming! great job of being quick to update the app and user interface and continuing to add great features!
. very user friendly app.
. as someone who is constantly on the go, i have minimal access to a desktop computer. this app makes it easy to invoice and record payments right from my phone whether i can make it to the office or not
. good app
. app never opens complete bull
great app and accounting. excellent accounting software and a great app as well. nice work qb!
crashes constantly every time i try to use it!. crashes multiple times every time that i try to use the app! on line works fine. the app keeps freezing saying saying critical updates needed! but i already updated app and deleted the app and reinstalled it. i tried everything i could do. so frustrating! older versions worked well. this is on an iphone xmax. newest phone .., latest version ... not working!!
. very easy to enter receipts. very easy to keep track of expenses. super easy to do quotes for contracting once all of your inventory is loaded.
owner. great app
. cant use this app point, wont allow me to attach my business bank account to it.
. super userfriendly! very professional invoices. i love it.
lacks expenses. one of the handiest things for me is logging an expense right when i buy it. can't do this as of now. (apparently this is a limitation of the canadian app)
fantastic app for small business. i have been using quickbooks for a year now. before i used to use myob and it used to cost me double what i pay now. it has all the features i need and usually works without any problems. i can write up quotes onsite, and send invoices before i leave the job. i highly recommend this app for small businesses.
. connect to banking and reconcile in minutes. email invoices...so no snail mail.
. great app
. i am totally dissatisfied with qb small business app and quickbooks in general. i'm also using an android and having the same syncing problem. i will be cancelling my subscription with quickbooks altogether and will be going with one of their competitors. it has been a waste of my time with all the phone calls with their technical support in the philippines who gave totally incorrect information about the issue which was clarified when i spoke to customer service in sydney.
underdeveloped & terrible support. the software is totally undeveloped and does not have the features of the regular desktop version. tech support is horrific, they can't help because they don't have the knowledge. intuit had no business releasing the software to the public it's not even ready for beta yet. the iphone app is worthless!
. so handy. like having an accountant in my back pocket.
works great!. for an app this is very powerful and lets you know the basics on the run.
awesome. i have an hvac business and everything in this app is awesome. the invoicing,estimates,collecting payments, emailing invoices or estimates, the whole thing. my wife does the books and she loves this version of quickbooks better than the pro version. i can access it from my ipad or iphone and my wife can access it from her samsung phone. all around great app. you do have to have the quickbooks online version on a computer and it has a monthly fee, but well worth it.
"keep getting ""session expired"" message with every log in attempt. completely makes the app nonfunctional for on the go business. critical flaw! please fix it!!"
great and user friendly!. although its quite hard at first but its quite easy to adapt.
easy to use. it have save me time and money.
". was ok before, functioned similar to the web. now any functionality it has for creating and sending invoices ""requires web to use that service"" i will be uninstalling until this app can function similar to its web counterpart."
business at a glance. for the detailed stuff, i like to stick to the desktop version, but for quickly seeing the status of invoices  profit and loss, the mobile app is great.
outstanding app!. owning a small business has enough headaches as it is. with quickbooks, estimating and invoicing projects and services couldn't be easier! everything is streamline! here's a look inside my day to day as a landscaper using quickbooks: initial client meeting> estimate delivered before i leave the property.. bam! they call back that night or the next day and we have the job. after we finish the project, turn that estimate into an invoice on site.. bam! paid! $$ in the bank!
great product. i love using the cloud version of this software to make my business more streamlined
disaster. was forced to use qb online due to always changing fees for desktop version. always crashes. hard to use. terrible. wish i could use another program. new version has new colours!! yay so practical!! doesn’t accommodate qc payroll deductions like cssnt but that’s ok, it’s colourful. intuit idiots.
. very easy to use mobile app means i can invoice quickly!
no complaints!!!. 👍👍👍👍the first business app ever that i'm unable to find anything wrong with. my boss & i love it. it's incredible how close this app comes to the qbo full website in terms of what we're able to access and accomplish using it. leaves all competitors in the dust. keep up the good work qbo!!!
needs to improve. the more i use this the more i find things that annoy me. when reconciling the bank why can i not just add a receipt photo to a bank transaction. that way i don't have to add it as an expense then match the bank transaction. it would save me time. seriously considering giving xero a try.......
. little slow to open, all in all does what i expected. good for use out of the office.
problems. what my bookkeeper is finding is payments being applied to the wrong invoices. it’s really messed things up. from the checks being deposited from my bank. also, for some reason my quickbooks is duplicating invoices. i will have to erase the app and download again.
awesome app. i'm in sales and this app is so much easier to use than my computer. it takes me 2 minutes to fill in the info and i'm done and my costumers can be on there way. thanks quick book.
great app. extremely easy to use and has made doing my accounts a much easier and enjoyable experience! would highly recommend!
"confusing and cluttered app. i love that nearly all of the features in the desktop app are here in the mobile app. however the interface, especially the home page, is confusing and cluttered. ""company activity"" is a bit useless as the default page. show me the charts of paidunpaid invoices. i think the developers are tasked with including every single feature and that clouds their design judgement. it's not an easy ask but let's make this app more mobile friendly."
o melhor!. excelente!!! minha ferramenta de gestão financeira.
. the app is horrible. doesn't update ky information, ia like a month behind. very frustrating. you are good at billing me every month, that part is up to date🙄.
can't add or view expenses. the expenses option is not available! so why to have this app then?
garbage. quick books won’t upload garbage use and other accounting software.
don't bother. been using qb desktop for years. disapointed in the sasmobile version. mobile app is slow and frequently fails to load at all. not much functionality at all besides creating invoices. checking account balances or customer ar is not worth the bother on mobile app. this is an ok solution. i bet there are better options available than qb mobile app.
allsecuresysyems. love this app. works great!
. app looks great.
excellent. quickbooks online works great for me and makes my work much easier especially with the phone app
. great app, love that i don't have to write a note to bill someone or change something later. i can do it right after i hang up or deliver an order. still learning all the options. it's not always as straightforward as i'd like, but a couple clicks and i can figure my way around to where i want to go.
customer service and functions. you can be completely locked out upon renewal of your subscription. it has locked me out of entering for the last six days. tech support has been pretty useless at fixing it. with all the other flaws the online program has, avoid with every thing you have. you get no back up, high incompatibility, and many accountants hate it. your emailed invoice has a habit of hitting the spam bin,it isn't even compatible with other intuit products. avoid avoid avoid
still needs work. one thing needed i’d making it easier to change customers info when doing a new invoice for a previous customer but at a new address. i have many customers that own many places and i need to be able to put the address in for each place where the work is done with that same customer and the app doesn’t allow this to happen.
do not use mobile to create your account. lost all our data on our old account because apparently if you first sign up using ios you absolutely cannot continue the subscription using your computer. had to just make a new account. you also can’t access any of the profile from the computer once the subscription runs out so i wasn’t able to download and save any of the data either. do not use mobile to create yor account.
. big time saver allows me too stay in the field, no need to make a trip to the office, no problems at all, love it.
. the support is terrific
. best accounting app.
. love this app.... only two things that i can't figure out. first, will not let me have a service date when making an invoice. most important, cannot figure out how to get it to accept the online payments thru ipn. on the desktop version it is highlighted on the invoice and in the email when its sent. other than those two issues, this app is great. would love to use this daily!
. excellant app helped taking the stress out of book keeping
new update crashes every time. new update makes me close and reopen every time for critical app updates
easy. i can't believe how easy this app is to use!
. great app to use for all my business needs
so easy to use!. this app is easy to use! i like it more than the desktop version!
. love it. does all i need for now
brian peterson remodel. great app. wish i could attach pictures to estimates and invoices using my mobile app.
changed my rating to 5.. i used to upload all my account transactions from this app. now they are gone. that was the only thing i used the app for. it is now useless to me. ***update*** your suggestion worked. changed my rating.
managing partner at green mesa capital, llc. a very useful app. i can do everything i want through this app. in addition, the app has features the browser does not have, like the expense receipt capture.
. user friendly
a1 app. i love this app ! i'm using it all day !
. great app
love it. we love quickbooks online, we would be lost without this app and online access. thanks quickbooks :)
. great app for my small buisness. quickbooks is always improving. best customer service when you have questions.
. i would give at least two more stars if the app actually lets me use my card reader, followed by the lack of automatic syncing and not even using active price rules whenever i need to make an invoice for a particular customer. please fix the card reader settings at least.
. incredibly hard to unsubscribe, i have been paying for this app and do not need it after 2 years. i still cannot find the unsubscribe part on google play and have followed the useless instructions to do so. not happy.
almost perfect. it would be perfect if there was an overview dashboard that showed outstanding invoices like the online dashboard.
best accounting software i've tried. this has got to be the most intuitive feature rich reasonably priced cloud computing package for small business i've ever seen. waaay better than myob, such a great little app.
more of a headache than a help. registered online, used same login info for the app, and the app says it's a free trial. online service not communicating well with app and i was hoping to use the app most of the time. sigh.
lowered rating. gave it 4 stars last year. since then it is completely unreliable and almost useless.
. no option to import sales and purchase. even a free software in india provides this feature. need to install a third party software for that and is very confusing. purchased the service but not now i will not use this.
. very slow and not convenient as current fast trend requirements....it's waste of money..i really suggest for zoho..very good..very fast ....best service and users convenient...
. it makes invoicing easier
why isn't app as easy to use as actual online. the online version is so much easier to navigate. i don't like that the app and the online version have things in different places. it makes it much harder to locate things. i would rather have one streamlined version to use on all devices.
. excellent app need to improve speed only.
pathetic on ipad. i don’t know why intuit bother to have an ipad app. it never works, has less functionality than a browser. the latest update tells you your account doesnt exist, the exact same log in as a browser. someone in the development department is being paid far too much for a substandard product. avoid the app like the plague
. can't add expenses. my husband has the mobile app on his iphone where we can add expenses. i do not see this option on android. bothersome.
crashes. app crashes every time i'm using a lg g5 emailed support for help 3 weeks ago no response.sent response never heard back.
. make sure you know what services they provide, as customer support likely knows less than you do.
fantastic features. all the features that works under this single app. i used to work with excel spreadsheet, invoice app, expense app to complete the business on the go. now everything has being simplify into this one subscription saving me time and double entry. i am absolutely happy that i can email invoice, take pictures and enter expense using my iphone. best of all these is update into the cloud. great excellent accounting software nothing comes close after trying others accounting software.
missing key features. most notably, there is no way to create bills on qb for ios. this is a major feature that is just not available without a desktop. i can’t even use a mobile browser to login because the web gui gets cut off when entering a bill, even in landscape mode on an ipad.
unable to log in. i have used quickbooks at office and decided to get it for my self but after downloading app it keeps giving me an error when i try to log in to the app. very unfortunate...i really like quickbooks
two thumbs up!. have only been using for about 30 minutes and has made my business 1000x easier!
qb makes me look good. qb app is fantastic. i can write and present an estimate right at the job site or give my customer an invoice, or accept payment. in brief....it makes me look good!
. great app!
good for on the road. let's me add invoices and expenses while away from the office, works well.
very happy with qbo. it beats invoice2go and is very friendly to use. no doubt it's the #1 invoicing app.
pretty convenient!. i quite like being able to enter transactions on the fly. this app keeps me from procrastinating!
please add a “transfer” option on app. overall good app but would like to have a transfer option on the mobile app i find myself having to login to the desktop version just to transfer amounts between my accounts. also, someone please find a way to mark estimates as “readseen” by the customer just like the invoices do. ipad version needs help; jumps around too much
5 star. with expense tracking. this is now awesome
good app. good app
. well after the experience so far it's great when i need to merge all apps at home then i can rate better. customer service has been just awesome so far. thanks it makes tracking expenses easy as taking a picture and putting the irs info in.
. i'm hooked love to send estimates and invoices on the fly.
this app is harmful. support is useless or you really can’t recover the emails you sending to the clients with your invoice
keeps crashing. every time i try to upload a receipt from my phone, it crashes when i press save & doesn’t save at all. i’ve tried closing the app & trying again, but it does it every time, so basically i can’t take a picture of any receipt & upload it. please fix!
an entire office mgmt team in one app. quickbooks literally took me from a life of getting to work at 7:00 a.m. and eventually falling asleep in my chair in front of the computer try to keep up with invoices and tax documents. for 3 months this went on and now about 20 minutes after work and the rest of the night is mine to enjoy. thank you immensely.
. log in issues and it stopped tracking my mileage on its on. i'm trying to pull my information for my taxes and it will not let me log on. more than frustrating, i want my money back!!!! and yes i have tried reinstalling the app!
. tells me to update the app i go to up data and at boots's be back i can't even use it right now
useless. this app is useless. you can't even see your check register. pathetic.
used to love it.... ever since the app was updated, i can no longer get past the sign in screen on my galaxy note 5. at least it still works on my ipad i guess...
. very easy to use mobile accounting app
was enjoying it until ios13 update. this app was working fine until i updated to ios13...... boom! nothing now. crashes on opening everytime.
. fantastic app for keeping my expenses up to date on the go and much more!
. love it. great for doing estimates
great as an assistant to the desktop version.. i've found this app to be a great mobile partner to the full desktop (or online) version. there's a couple functions that aren't available in the app but everything you do need is easily available. i can't connect my bank account because my (non us) bank isn't listed but being able to input expenses as they happen is a great way of keeping updated accounts. reconciliation is a breeze afterwards. it's a great app.
zero stars 10.3 is junk. i used this app several times a day. i run my business on this app. since april 10th i cannot access my data. my business is suffering and intuit cannot fix it. i still have to pay. tech support at intuit  quickbooks recommended i switch to a android. (i doesn't work on my iphone or ipad) i really do not want to invest in new hardware. stay away from intuit they do not care and offer no solutions.
just like the web version. the new updates are great. it's just like the web version minus tax lodgements which is possibly due to regional differences. the only gripe i have is the lack of keyboard integration which means you will need to use the touch screen but it's an ipad app so can't really complain there.
app crashes on splash screen. on iphone 6s plus. this has been happening for so long and there is no action taken. i’ve tried uninstall and reinstall multiple times and nothing is working.
small businesses best friend. if you have a small business this should be the first thing that you get. having this on your phone to do invoices on the spot is the only way to go.
small business owner. absolutely awful. i was forced to switch to online because of a fatal error of the desktop version on mac seirra. there are so many bugs and things that aren't available on online that were on the desktop. i literally call support for 2hrs a day.
awesome. this app is great and extremely helpful with my small business. it saves a lot of time and work. not only do i find it very resourceful but it's easy to use. customizing my invoices and estimates is probably the best part of the application aside from it allowing me to check my profit and loss. i recommend this app to any user, especially a business owner.
won’t interface to bank any more. after several months since my bank kicked qb out of accessing my bank account for reconciling, the problem still remains. accessing my bank account and reconciling all transactions over my iphone was my number one reason to use qb. still disappointed. i have to pay a bookkeeper to do my books with qb now. why can xero have bank access but qb can’t sort itself out after several months !
. great app for small business owners that are always on the go..
india is not mentioned. sorry to say that but i uninstalled the app in 3mins because india as a nation is not mentioned.
please stop making my sign in. every other fingerprint authentication app on my phone (banking, password manager, file managers) does not nag me to log in via password every other day. why does this app do so? please fix.
customer service and functions. you can be completely locked out upon renewal of your subscription. it has locked me out of entering for the last six days. tech support has been pretty useless at fixing it. with all the other flaws the online program has, avoid with every thing you have. you get no back up, high incompatibility, and many accountants hate it. your emailed invoice has a habit of hitting the spam bin,it isn't even compatible with other intuit products. avoid avoid avoid
. great app for invoicing and tracking expenses
great piece of kit for small business. i have a small business servicing skis and selling waxes from home, i had to send all my invoices out using a word template, this has streamlined all my admin and accounting processes leaving me more time to work with my customers equipment. highly recommended
very good. one of the best way to do estimate and invoices highly recommended
. this has to be the worst app going zero customer support constantly lied too been trying for 3 weeks to send an invoice and they don't care as long as you keep paying absolute rip off...not far from being a scam spoke to managers about problems and still nothing done do don't waste your time or money...try any other program or stick to pen and paper far better and less stressful
. since your app can't seem to stop asking me to review it. well here you go. 1 star. i pay you a ton of money each year to use your app, which means i'll review it if i want. stop asking me every time i open the dumb thing.
. good app. looking forward to the future and a full use of the online version in the app.
. i use this app while i had my quickbooks trial, and it seemed to be working fine. the minute i subscribed, the app stopped working properly. i emailed support, no one seems to be answering my questions, and when i phone the customer service, they don't know how to help with the app. i'm stuck and ready to cancel the whole thing.
makes it all the easier. program runs excellent always active on me note 3 a couple of things id love to see added. purchase orders and file attachments to invoices this would perfect it for me.
qb enterprise user. intuit forgot about medium sized companies with the need to use their program remotely. shame 😝
. would like to be able to send invoices
great for a busy contractor!. i can send invoices or check on my bids from the job site. very convenient!
latest update buggy. the latest update will not compiler updating.
. how to find bill for supplier in mobile app ?
. made delivering estimates to my customers an immediate action. right from my car in front of their residence.
easy. real good, compatible with my metro phone.
simple things just don’t work in this app.. now i can’t copy my password from my password safe into the quickbooks login. this means i will have to use a simple easy to use and less secure password. also, there is no way to enter check numbers into the bank transactions. this works fine on a mac and online but not in the ipad app. these simple problems make the ipad app almost useless.
. pathetic for indian users. quick book online for android not supported fir india. there website never successfully register for trial..so poor user experience.
easy and super user friendly. first time user of this type of app but it was easy to set up. sent out my first invoice after 1hr already.
easy to use. hey it's worth the money easy to understand and help you to keep track of everything access anywhere .this is the future! thank you quickbooks
. best app to have to keep updated!!!!
stopped working after the update. this was working great until the software update last week. now i end up creating multiple copies of invoices and estimates and the app just freezes on the saving screen. i can only finish off by logging in through a web browser and completing the task. please fix this fast intuit!
"quick books is the bombdiggity!! ya heard!. as a small business owner it saves me time, click, picture of the receipt, click and the expense is logged in real live time. no more saving piles and piles of receipts. it also pin point tracks your expenditures. it's the ""bombdiggity""!"
. can do a lot quickly. like most apps doesn't allow you to do everything you can do on full site. great for adding invoices on the go.
. best accounting app i have used. the functions in the app has enabled me to easily access clients information to provide information for decision making. best
great app. easy to use when on the go.
don't support in india. if you don't support in india why you create account in first place.
. terrible...i am still trying to cancel the trial period...i contacted them via phone, email and followed all heir instructions amd nothing...the section to cancel doesnt exit for me ..they keep repeating the same and avoid t9 answer.
"great app for distributors. we can invoice and deliver on the fly without having to go back to the office to capture the ""in the moment sales"". our accountant has access and was able to set our account up to match his categories for a fast and no worry tax prep."
. love the mileage and receipt feature.
. good apps.
love it. simple. powerful. streamlined. definitely worth it if you have qb online.
experience getting worse. entering transaction requires way too many taps. it isn’t location aware to suggest transactions you just always search. recent updates have some bug that makes the app download the data file with almost every login and login often you must. usually twice a week it loses my password. i have enjoyed quickbooks online but this app experience may have me evaluating competitors in december.
. u need to put the all app in full.
really enjoy this.. so happy to switch over to qb online, from the pc version. easy to set up, runs smooth and quickly, and like that i can access from any device.
. the image quality of attaching receipts automatically downgrades and makes everything blurry. this renders the receipt image capture completely useless.
don’t waste your time. the developer is very slow to fix bugs and non responsive when a complaint or ticket is generated. the tax rates are a total mess in the app. there is very little control over adding new or editing existing rates generated by qb while using the online version. any time i use an apple product i have the same issue.
help desk is horrible. please hire someone who either speaks english or will transfer your call to someone who can when directed to do so no fewer than 5 times. pathetic.
very good!. really does help to keep everything at your finger tips, it's a convenient way to keep track of your earnings and invoices. one quick glance and you know where your company is at! 👍🏻
disappointing. i've been a longtime user of the desktop version of quickbooks for the past 20 years and just recently switched to quickbooks online. i was really looking forward to managing my company's expenses, print checks, and enter bills from my new ipad. i am terribly disappointed in the complete lack of features available in this app. it's actually completely useless and a waste of memory. how could intuit release such a piece of garbage such as this?
very useful on day to day business. makes mobile invoice and payment tracking a breeze
. love this app. hardly have to get on my computer
. it's a great app. i use it all the time with my company. very efficient, and easy to navigate. automatically logs out so no one else can get access to it ( logs out after being in active for a certain amount of time). making banking, estimate invoice, and employees records very easy to keep track of. also love that i can store customers an accept payment online also. only downside sometimes it can be slow but other than that it's outstanding
great app!!. just switched from quicken, and i don't know why i waited so long. qb is very versatile and comprehensive.
. just new to quick books and new business owner find it very user friendly easy to navigate and edit without too much tutorial going with basic version for now will upgrade in future.
new update has me locked out. automatic update to my software today. now i can access my account. fix it now! i am paying way too much to not be able to access my account!
update killed app for me!. used to love this app as i’m a paid subscriber, but the recent update doesn’t launch anymore. i’ve tried removing and reinstalling same result. iphone x.
very happy with app. the app is very good, and provides a lot of useful information that can be sent anytime, anywhere.
great app. helpful for small busines
. invoicing only works when it feels like. app is very hard to navigate. half the tools i have to log in to my computer and do on the desktop version. very dissatisfied and will be cancelling this service soon as i find a better alternative.
. the app is a wonderful accompaniment to the software which makes tracking expenses and invoices really easy
. another app failed to provide the timely support i needed. i have used quickbooks before and i am sure i will have a great experience!
failure......again. when will quickbooks get their act together???? touch id to log in is gone with this update, still a lot of features from desktop version are missing. don't like the idea that the user has no control on the data and backups.
pathetic. when will intuit wake up and get a real program for the ipad? very limited unless all you want is invoicing....disappointed....was hopeful at one point but have had it with intuit
a j rooter. it's an easy program to use makes life a lot less aggravating when you can do your work on the road
. quickbooks have never let me down. this app is great to manage my business.
esd works well needs one more feature. works well for the features that it offers could be better with if it included pictures for invoice transfer to portfolio
. explain to me why i cannot screenshot anything any more? i have multiple customers that like to see their over all balance owed but now i can't send them a screenshot anymore. so you update the app to fix things, manage to mess up the one feature that worked best for me and still haven't fixed th spelling on the word supplies (it's literally spelt suppliea). great job!
cannot edit suppliers at all with the ipad app. i think the title says it all. i started an invoice from a supplier, however i cannot continue it on the ipad. it is just impossible! it just cannot be done. so it is for that reason only i am giving it one star. on the computer it is great, the ipad app is useless.
. love this app love this app
would be better if i could manage payroll on the app. i would love to be able to do up my company’s payroll on the fly if i’m out on a job site or on a business trip. please fix this
great functionality across platforms. i use qbo to do estimates and invoicing on a laptop, ipad and iphone. i occasionally swipe a credit card too and they all perform very well. little bit presentation on each device but they all work!
improved quickbooks. it has many features than can help small businesses. the app can help you to organize, make use of spare time to do work.
"customer service is outstanding.. i'm a contractor, not a ""business man"" by any stretch. but, the qb staff have helped me many times to navigate and learn. kudos!"
". loving being able to access and invoice on the go! can be slow but so can online. entering invoices on phone i have to hide the keyboard to go to next field  be good to have ""next"" button."
. improve ur app i clear all my data buy in app its still coming
. it's been years and the login still fails 80% of the time. have to clear data in the app just to login. it's a nightmare.
need more work. it’s ok for beginners they still need to improve it
. the customer service for quickbooks is ridiculous their merchant services handles your incoming payments and places holds on them with no notification until after banking day has closed and until after their business has closed. unless you are a multimilliondollar business i do not recommend using quickbooks for anything this was the biggest waste of money i have ever spent and is almost cost me to close my business.i would give you negative stars if i could you are the absolute worst platform .
. not as user friendly as the desktop edition, but it does that job well.
. i cant for the life of me grasp how i need to male an account before even seeing a demo or testing. not cool
ridiculous omission. i can not believe that with all of the updates that you still can not create a purchase order with this app. ridiculous.
great timesaver. i used the free app and i have made up my mind that i will be purchasing this for my small construction business.
. apparently i don't know my password or id, yet i just used the exact same login details to login on my pc... level of angry right now is fairly high
great app. i use this everyday! wouldn't want any other invoicing company
self employment. great app
easy enough to use, works best with the online version. i'm only using this for the basics of bookkeeping, so it's enough for me. the functions in the app is different than the online version, so i mainly use it to take pictures of invoices. i enter an invoice online, then snap a picture of the invoice using the app. i also use the app to quickly get a monthly total per supplier, which the online version doesn't have.
. a little slow at times. navigation could be better
awesome app. simple, clean. just need the banking feed for the android in canada please!
great book keeping app. use this app with the online version at home. very happy with it indeed. support could be a little better. but support is adequate. been using it for a couple of years and i'm very pleased.
crashes. app is unusable after ios 13.0 update.. crashes. app is unusable after ios 13.0 update.
doesn’t work with ios13. pls fix
. sweet app
"it doesn't synchronize. the app is totally unusable. it doesn't synchronize customers and supplier and the transaction with those missing from the list result as incomplete. tried also to dis install and reinstall: same story. on top of this it must also said that the assistance is unresponsive, many days and repeated enquiries to finally get emails full of irritating smileys and useless answers like ""we are constantly improving the apps to serve our mobile customers""."
quick books. awsome app. helps when your always on the go.
new to qb app. love it
. great app! keeps me going while on the go!
app. grate app worth purchasing i'd recommend this to anyone
crashes constantly every time i try to use it!. crashes multiple times every time that i try to use the app! on line works fine. the app keeps freezing saying saying critical updates needed! but i already updated app and deleted the app and reinstalled it. i tried everything i could do. so frustrating! older versions worked well. this is on an iphone xmax. newest phone .., latest version ... not working!!
. good app but it's annoying that i have to remove and reinstall the app for almost every update that's released.
. as a new user, very user friendly, tools are available it just takes time to learn everything!
much room for improvement. if it were free, it's a great product , but as a paid program and app, it could use a good deal of user input towards improvement
administrator. nice application.
crashing in on the reliable. overall not a great product  i actually do enjoy quickbooks online. but this app is just atrocious. history improve in so many ways just to get one more star out of me
. great app loving it
. it's super annoying when you need to use it for issuing 1099s, or for anything tax related. it constantly makes me relog even though it's an app, on my phone, which also has a password. very irritating. finally i'm absolutely sick of seeing and hearing their stupid ads all over the place. unfortunately it's the most convenient program available, which isn't saying much, but that's why i didn't give 1 star.
real convenient. it's a big time saver. i'm able to send invoices from anywhere. that alone has allowed me to get paid quicker.
yep. great app...appart from the lack of multi currency function...
great. for ecommerce in india, please add easy integration of csv files from marketplaces directly to quickbooks. third party apps are not upto the mark.
best quickbooks i have used.. this app does everything for your business it's quick it's easy and fast so i recommend this to anybody
very useful!. this app allows me to send clients a sales receipt as soon as they hand me the cash, invaluable when visiting clients.
a good start. i have 19 overdue invoices and quickbooks sent me 19 alerts about it, telling me i have 19 overdue invoices, all at the same time. how about sending 1 alert only?
awesome app. feature rich and also user friendly
easy and effective. very easy and convenient, would just like if they add the ability to create a purchase order to suppliers from the app.
easy to use. overall i like this. having a quick option while on the go is great.
great for small business. i run a small business mostly through through etsy. this is a great program to keep track of finances. the only thing i wish is it would integrate paypal here payments like it does square. it would be amazing if it could do the same with etsy. alas, i have to type them in by hand. i love the integrate on my iphone, ipad and macbook. it is very streamlined.
questionable developers and qa. don’t bother with this app. more time updating this weekly with version changes and bug fixes... jokers
keeps crashing. for the most part, the apps work pretty well. however, for whatever reason the app on my iphone crashes every time i login the first time. it gives me an error saying critical error please sign out. most the time when i sign back it, it’s ok after that. but usually requires restarting the app.
. very slow to load.
. app doesn't have all features, as we have it in web application.
very very useful. this app is a great way of using quick books online. some limitations compared to using the full version via the web but enough to make things a lot easier and on the spot. one star off for limitations etc but recommend.
purchased but won’t work.. i can not contact customer service to save my life!! i purchased this after my trial but it won’t acknowledge that i have. very upset and frustrated!!!
i'm an accountant. it make my life sooooo easy...live doing accounts from the swimming pool with a cocktail in a hand and phone on other ;) i❤technology
. fantastic app to keep track of all my construction expenses, so much simpler being able to log expenses straight from phone.
could use improving. i love that i can quickly post payment and send invoices, but there needs to be a way to see everything and use all of the features. a contractors version would rate more stars from me.
efficient app. as a bookkeeper i use qbo for all of my clients as well as for my personal account. it just keeps getting better and better. accepting transactions is a breeze as is setting up invoices, paying bills, and writing estimates. one feature my clients find helpful is the receipt attachment. i would highly recommend this app for anyone who uses qbo.
good when it works. i had internet quick books for my small business. had log in problems almost every time i used it. canceled it.
when i am done, i am done!. as a contractor i love to do my estimates one time, hit convert to invoice one time, hit receive payment one time and i am done with my paperwork and money is heading my way before i leave the job site. when i get home i can just spend time with the family rather than swim through paperwork. great service!
". app for android stinks. only loads a few visible parts and if you try to update an invoice, originally entered on the desktop, it will ""zero out"" the parts not found on the app (causing invoicing discrepancies). ayou also can't upload attachments to invoices (which i use frequently in my business). until intuit can make their app consistent with the desktop version it is unusable for mobility."
just tolerable. why limit the time going back to review past invoices? does not make sense.
. i have down loaded the app but its not working properly its frustrating
would like to see. new user, so maybe i'm missing something, but there should be a way to create an expense report and bill it to a customer.
really good!. overall i think it's a great app. the one thing i would like them to add is the total dollar amount in the invoice section. in other words it would be nice to see a dollar amount on the tabs for open invoices and past due invoices.
awesome app, love quickbooks. use it often to add expenses and check bank data. nice feature of receipt photo, works great
ipad app. please update your app to be more like the desktop version...i can not track inventory received through the ipad app i purchased and ipad pro hoping to do away with my laptop and so far its been seamless, except for this app not being able to track inventory received. i hope your developers can figure this out before my 8 year old laptop crashes! thanks
owner. love the app. makes running my business so easy. i would give it five stars except once i was using the app and the system was down for little while. made me feel a little uneasy
incomparable with ipad pro. this app works terrible with ipad pro. basically made this business expense a complete waste as the app and web program useless on the ipad pro. extremely disappointed and frustrated.
bad update. keeps asking me to sign in every time. can't use touch id or pin. fix it quick! 😩
a difference. i show a difference between the bank and the gl, that does not reconcile but the app isn't giving me any unreconciled items. it doesn't make any sense.
not useful at all. this app was written by someone who does not understand quickbooks and its purpose. get back to basics please if this is to be used by us.
excellent once setup. i run my whole business on quickbooks. it was a little tricky to set up initially but once my bookkeeper had given it the once over, everything was perfect. great stock management system that ties in to the invoices and hooks in with the business bank account. this makes self assessments etc very easy and saves loads of time. very happy :)
easy. great app just what i need as a digital nomad.
great that it exists, now it needs to be great. it's so awesome to be able to manage my business from my phone. but. that's not the same as the app itself being so awesome. it's frustrating to use at times and could benefit from some thorough ux work.
unable to signin. since the update, qb won't authenticate on iphone 5s: either it states technical difficulties or the login info is incorrect. i'll uninstall and install to see if that resolves this new programming error.
president. this app is great for small (mobile) business owners doing paperwork on the fly. it keeps office time to a minimum.
. great app..
awsome software. that is a great app but still far away from the desktop program .... limited access for a lot futures it's ok but not wow for the yearly cost
great app!. so easy to use, really makes a difference to be able to invoice and do payments on the move.
. fantastic overall experience. easy and convenient to use
great app. easy to use very helpful!!!!!
. best accounting software! worst customer service ever!!!! hold times are hours & when you finally get a person, which is a miracle, they get offended if your upset & will hang up on you!they do not want to help you, just keep you trapped in their maze paying that monthly (rediculous) price! all they want is your money! & will hold your important business info & data entered as ransome. *horrible business practice*
beautiful app, curious about next features.. the revamped qb online is really attractive. still people coming from the classic qb are missing features. qb uses a great system to allow customers to vote for features. the success of the online version will depend on how fast qb development will be able to produce the big wishlist of new features.
. the app makes use in the field easy.
. pos is not available. app struggles to load despite i have a samsung note 9
. i want & need a 5 star but i cannot get any kind of help with my issue , which is i cannot get my invoices to go out via gmail. help!
best app. very helpful online support
h2a solutions. best way to invoice my customers
. app don't update with bank account need to use desk top
. good app. always improving.
really good app. ok, at first i was reluctant to use it, but after trying it i found it really easy and simple. don't wait, use it.
great. so nice to be able to do invoices on the run. very user friendly!
nothing adds up. when you run a business you want your numbers correct. i don't have time to troubleshoot why your software can't add a simple paypal balance and leaves transactions out. your fired!
. amazing app
great. very user friendly
very nice app. very easy to use and make my all estimates and invoices very smooth and keep the updates very soon
. was working for a couple months. now i can longer link to my bank account and the app constantly freezes with either a blank screen or white screen. completely useless..
amazing. this app is amazing work flawlessly
don’t bother downloading!. this app was so hard to use, wouldn’t connect to my bank, wasted so much time trying. brought up all of my personal accounts transactions even though i asked it to hide them. wouldn’t bring up transactions older than 3 months. i honestly don’t understand how anyone can use it!!!
. slow, laggy and pretty featureless
. honestly it's great, good for simple business use.. links well back to qb online.
. not sure if this was resolved but in reviewing past expenses and invoices, it looks like 85% have disappeared. if i entered more than 1 expense on a single day, it kept 1. some days i entered 56 receipts if not more and now i'm redoing them all. switched to a bookkeeper this year so haven't used the app in 6+ months.
awesome. it saves me so much time. great to keep up with my business accounting. mostly simple to use. some features require a bit of basic accounting knowledge.
yep. great app...appart from the lack of multi currency function...and would be great if we could easily switch company as on the web
. great app. very functional.
. great app.
. malfunctions on every level. did not attach a single receipt picture to the transaction. brought in the bank accounts and scrambled them. even on the desktop deposits are expenses and you cannot edit them
disaster to sign out. i happened to see this app and found it is interesting to scan invoices but turns to be that i have to be a “company” to use it and have to pay so much for it! so expensive!!!!!!
really good software. i just wish the software team will work on all the glitches and fix the way done windows freeze... also they need to add to quickbooks online and make it more flexible accounting wise just like the desktop version
excellent app. keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
perfect business program. only thing missing is purchase order creation
. good app for startup
. best app
works and convenient. easy way to enter sales and expenses. i've had no problems with this app.
. best app for small businesses
. for over a week, the app has been failing to load my account details. i sent the error report by email too. i am using the correct login info and i have a samsung galaxy s10 plus. the app is poorly designed and maintained... spending all the money on those commericalsads vs on the actual product, not looking to renew once our lisence expires at this rate... we can just build our own system instead or use other functioning ones..
. great software
best app. this made my life simpler!!!
ios 13 incompatible. was using this app, working fine on my ipad with ios 12 but updated phone to ios 13 and will not load app but crashes every time i open it. i’m not paying for a dud app. fix it or refund my subscription.
great app!. at first, i thought that this app was pretty clunky and i didn't enjoy using it. in the last couple of years or so, it has gotten considerably better. i really like using it now.
great app. accounting on the go!. ahh my favorite part of the day just got a whole lot easier. this app lets you track you individual transactions on the fly. it also lets you categorize and itemize expenses. if you like neat books and your on your phone a lot this app makes things easy. it's free so just try it out.
customer files. sometimes all the estimates and invoices don’t show up in the customers file when i go into it on the app.
very useful. would live to see bank figures in there too
sweet app!. love the app for keeping track of my ar.
as everyone said wish you a good luck. it looks like this is not my issue, but everyone issue. i'm using it because, i have no other options, but think 1000 times before you put your books inside, i wish if i had this advise before i jumped in. good luck with quickbooks, and your new friends (customer support).
. great no problems
great app but....:.. good application but we need features that enable generation of reports
still needs some changes. multiple addresses for a company is still a drama as it changes all previous invoices and quotes. plus ipad app continually won't save edited quotes. have to use desktop version to edit invoices or quotes successfully. annoying!
. great app for mobile business owners such as myself.
online version need improvement. the online version specially on ipad is very difficult to use. if the could make the ipad version like the desktop version gui it would help. the app is a little unstable because of the cookies and the background history that doesńt refresh the actual data timely. overall, it is a decent product they just need to make some tweaks.
hate it. i officially hate this program and will be changing to another accounting software in july. i have been using quickbooks since 2000 and used to love its simplicity but it has become time consuming and harder to use. make a mistake...can't fix it. if you are away you can' access all the feature using the app  you find a computer and log on.
. great app
. seems to work well, very useful way of sorting receipts
great app!!. i love it! this program has totally transformed our family business!!
blair. app is extremely unstable. every time i need to get on it i have to force quit the app and re loggin. i have an iphone x and it runs horrible on here. hoping they fix this asap because i run my entire service company from the app
drafting estimates. when drafting estimates, system should auto save as many times hours of work is erased if you don’t constantly save before stepping away. in addition when you click the description box there should be an undo button in case it grabs all the text and it gets erased by pressing any button in accident. two very simple and logical things.
feedback. the app would be better if you were able to enter bills not just expenses. very annoying to have to also use my desktop computer to finish my book work.
projectivity. great app for my consulting business. once you enter your data quick books can show you a picture of what your business looks like; where your money is coming in by customer. instantly produces reports, reminds you if you have invoices overdue and can be linked to your bank. what more would a small business want? i love this bookkeeping program. :)
pretty good!!. just started my business and so far liking what i’m seeing. the app is pretty neat.
. ☢️ testversion — 30tage  nur englisch 👎🏼 ☢️ deinstallliert ⚠️ edit: aber wozu eine app, wenn ich um die website nicht herumkomme ⁉️
. update sucks
awesome software. easy, user friendly, easy to organize and update!
problemas con la tasa de importe. no puedo editar ni agregar una tasa o precio del artículo en las facturas ni estimaciones en iphone 7 plua
. great software. so easy to use and very reliable.
. awesome app, makes management easy
. where do i start. purchased to help with accounts for small self employment business. did not upload new transactions from bank account or paypal as advertised on app or the full site. mileage tracker was not accurate. user interface too basic. so frustrating as i would use this constantly but as it does not upload my transactions properly, it is unusable. far too glitchey as an app. wish i had done free trial and not wasted money on it.
qb. completely unusable since 6th september update. crashes all the time on latest ios please fix this.
best app ever. thank you quickbooks making everything simple
. love the convenience i have used this app for a while and i enjoy how it facilitates my need to create and track everything on the go. i would recommend quickbooks to any small business operation.
excellent. does everything i need for my small business and allows seamless coordination with my accountant.
. i have always been loyal user of qb. this app is great.
. easy to set up and easy to use i reccommend talking to an accountant if your setting up a small business
great!. i've used quickbooks for years. very happy with the online. version, it allows me to take care of my invoicing anytime anywhere. my business is more profitable now because i can send an invoice when the job is complete and there's no forgetting to do it at the end of the day. if your business is mobile shouldn't your accounting be also?
. this app works well in ios, but a total disaster on android. i was supposed to renew my subscription, but instead, it routed me to creating a new company under a new subscription. i wasted my money for something i do not need. do not download this app.
tax problem in hong kong. i mostly use it to do my expenses, now with this update, they force me to input tax. but there is not tax here in hong kong. didn’t have the problem before. i don’t know how long they need to fix that. 👎🏻👎🏻
just what i needed. i run a small contractor business doing remodel work. the mobile app has been a godsend. i can track all my estimates, invoices & expenses in one place. helps me track clients that are late payers too (which sometimes happens). i like it. 100% worth the subscription
needs more. works good but simple
". was great, while it worked. like the previous review, on a galaxy s9 i just get a blank dashboard and cannot enter new expenses. so the product has no use. not very impressed with qb's ""we're working on it"" response. this should have been basic testing done by the team, not by paying customers."
. love this app. can upload receipts wherever i am
. i gave it a week b4 i changed my rating my qb is now working perfectly no more stress on updating my sales n payments... thanks team 5 star well deserved
ran into unsupported transactions within 1 minute. very disappointing. it seems like the app isn't complete.
. capable app for your expenses and keeping tabs on accounts on the go.
expenses. you cannot cost expenses to a particular job or client
". quickbooks is okay but the app is bad. won't ever let me log in the screen just hangs on ""hang on, we are getting your quickbooks data"" and then says that it can't connect..."
. haven't used it much yet, but just discovered you can't add time on the app. the main reason for getting this program was so employees could add time from their phone. when will this feature be available?
. user friendly... excellent app..
. great but like any software you have to take time to learn its capabilities and bugs
the best software. this software is just great
unable to log in. i have used quickbooks at office and decided to get it for my self but after downloading app it keeps giving me an error when i try to log in to the app. very unfortunate...i really like quickbooks
great for on the go use!. love using this app! great for small business use & being able to use anywhere! with multiple people using one app!!
great app.. helps so much w billing... highly recommended. .
. really like the taking pictures of receipts. mobile app is great
. update has not fixed this issue! why can't i see bank account details in the app? you can on the ios app contacted help desk who couldn't help! without access to accounts the app is effectively useless. i have done everything you suggest. home screen is now blank! so even worse than when i started. i have also contacted support with no solution as yet.
. great app!
great support but app is flawed. i have several companies setup on one login. this was done by qb themselves but it keeps crashing, stalling or telling me there is a fault. also don't choose 'other' as business type as list of income and expenditure categories is massively reduced and you will have to add the ones you want manually. customer service is excellent but i shouldn't need to know this!
very handy. excellent app love it save me hours in office
i would not recommend. 1. very very very expensive 2. not intuitive and not user friendly 3. no local support or live support from malaysia
seems to work decently. it crashes occasionally but so far i like being able to addmatch transactions while laying on the couch
. good overall very happy with this app. my only complaint is that my products are not listed by category like they are on the web based version so it makes it difficult to find items when creating invoices or estimates. the mobile site has this feature (but no option to create estimates), so hopefully the app could have it too?
. not for me and now i can't unsubscribe or delete account please delete account i don't want it and your unsubscribe tool does not work.
. good app, making it easier for me to work on the road.
bad update. was close to perfect, or at least practical. since the last update, this app is useless to me. hoping this will change!
not good. crashes often; slow; give frequent error messages.
hong leong connect first. i don’t get to link to my leong connect first account. please fix this so that i use it right away. my sister told me this app is superb.
. worst customer service ever.
. great app, i am a self employed consultant, i invoice with ach bank transfers for 0.0% free! all accounts synced. good stuff!
. hated it, warning, stay away. it mess up my quickbook online, duplicate everything, customer service promise to contact me, never happened. service bad. do not waste your time downloading. app version is useless, synchronization keep duplicates my receipts, and much more issues. stay away from quickbooks app. still not fix customer support ain't helping either, because is a third party app....
great & smooth accounting app. very good up to keep on top of your finances . it's the best on the market.
. terrible app and company. they hold your money and request ridiculous amounts of proof to get it back.
. love it kindly introduce an app for the managers too. which shows reports.
love it!. easy to use, great for mobile business. can create invoices with your own logo, receive payments and log them from anywhere. send invoices as well. i don't know what i would do without it! have a makeup business and recommending to my father too!
quick books online. good for customer data base. good for invoicing and receiving payments. fair at tracking expenses. near useless as an accurate or bookkeeping tool when linked to a bank account. so many obscure and poorly explained manual actions required that error is easy to introduce and tech support usually makes things worse. one may as use good old fashioned paper ledgers and a calculator. don't trust it with your numbers!
slow books. can’t accept transactions in banking section. sluggish app, end up using the computer more often.
adding pdf. can not add pdf attachments. to my invoices. app is crashing. please fix this.
could be much better.. this app needs lots of work. is not possible to assign an expense as billable. is also not possible to add markup from this app. lame.
makes books much easier to keep updated. this is a powerful combination of mobile, camera, and bookkeeping. much easier than relying on the desktop.
efficient. does all the work, and reminds me to collect on overdue invoices. i love it! not very expensive either!
do not sign up using the app. signing up from the app store restricts how you can use quickbooks online. you will not be able to change basic setting like email address or password. sign up from a desktop. then you can login to the app later.
. great now i can do alot of my office work while in the field. this app lets me have more time making money instead of sitting at home on computer.
inexplicably no timesheet support in app. the most obviously missing feature is time sheet support. the support team is also quite useless and closes cases without resolving them or providing any assistance.
quickbooks online + app. quickbooks online is making my business accounts so easy. the bank connections feature allows you to sync online accounts straight into your account records. when new transactions are available, you can view and add them straight into your accounts, made easier by quicbooks match feature that marks transactions with previous similar transactions. support during setup period has been excellent which has made switching from another online accounting software quite an easy process. very impressive so far.
"disappointing. if you also make ""mint"", why make your subscription service app so much worse? mint is great. this app is not."
great starter app. i wouldn't want to use this app all the time as is is a little annoying. does what it says on the tin, great as a starter accountancy tool.
. fantastic app
. quite limited functions got a few errors, will be nice to get most of desktop functions on phone.
so far so good!. easy to use, quick, simple. like it so far...
. mobile invoicing, categorizing expenses, pandl, ect. powerful. get it to save money and sky rocket efficiency in business. sooo good!
slow books. i am constantly waiting in front of my customers for qb to load
vendor purchase no option. it takes so much time for converting the invoice to pdf for printing.
new business. i just opened up my business and i'm being super careful of keeping track of all my financial expenses and sales. this app makes it easy!
fantastic qb's app. this app is great! works just as good, if not better, as the desktop version. to me it seems even more user friendly & it is just so convenient when on the go. definitely download! it works so well, i decided to pay the monthly fee to use it.
. awesome app..
hands down makes your business easier!. i've used qb for years. and and i've come and go thinking i'll find something easier. today's version of qb particularly with the mobile app hands down makes it so easy for me to track everything i do in my business. worth every penny you spend ... and oh ya ... it's a write off!
unhappy. bad program for ipad and android phone. bad customer service. very dissatisfied.
freelance developer. works great to record expenses and keep a copy of receipts.
could be better. still no auto save. it’s 2018 folks, time to wake up. does not perform the same on my phonetablet as my desktop. i.e automated emails on my desktop autofill my clients name, my phone does not. on my desktop i can switch the order of items on my invoices and estimates, on my phone i cannot. the simple editing features are extremely important on a device that smaller than my hand.
. the software just keeps crashing when i start it after i input password for last few months . i have only used compyter version. not very friendly software
. great app. easy to use
frustrating. decided to go with qb to simplify my accounts and let me do them incrementally through the month. very disappointed that sync works intermittently and leaves gaps. may be returning to paper is it isn’t sorted soon
good app. very detailed , im no pro @ accounting but i am teaching myself this app. its very in depth and i like it.
what’s going on?. i’m paying almost $11month for an app that “can’t update payment information right now.” this has been going on for weeks. i can’t even send current invoices. pointless to have at this time.
very useful. i use it every day for my business.
must have for small businesses. this has simplified my life immensely. i no longer have to worry about things falling through the cracks, quickbooks keeps it all in check. solid app, no issues or crashes yet after about 3 months of use.
great apo. this app has helped my business tremendously. inna smart phone society this app has helped me capture more clients.
comprehensive app for a small business. i have excellent experience and is easy to use with all functionality that i required. have tried xero, myob as well but quickbooks stand out for me as far as feature & function and good value for money.
not free. not a free app, just trial. tfn. re: your response, like i said it says it's free but it's not free..
. unfriendly interface need to load inventory data on invoice costs profits etc no facility
great app. easy to use. love the 4 digit log in option.
. great app.
great!!. works so well. love how easy it is to use, love how seamless the app works as well as the computer version. so easy to send invoices via email. was so happy when i found out easy it is to use!
"convoluted. extremely difficult to navigate. what should be a simple site to use, turns out to be very convoluted. far, far too many ""choices"" on how to input invoiced paid. transferring data from your bank account is a nightmare. site keeps suggesting i've already added that data....saying, oops, you have a ""match"". welllll, yeeees, many of my monthly bills are exactly the same amount each month, a recurring bill. not a match. arrggggg"
. 2 weeks into using this app it has made itself unusable, going back to paper invoices thanks quickbooks!
. this app is honestly magnificent. it helps me balance my checkbook. helps me track expenses and send invoices. it's honestly a must.
great. amazing app but whoever did that last update screw it all up. can save estimate or invoices. horrible. i hope they refund at least a month of fees because i'm loosing money having to do all my estimatesinvoices at my house instead. needs to be fixed asap.
. very easy and convenient, especially on the go
stock. the app doesn’t show stock levels under the products tab ! need this feature asap
simple and reliable. never quits. wicked easy to use.
. the app works well.
. love it. makes my life so much simpler. i own a dj company and for billing and keeping track of my expenses it works great! plus client service is a+
. easy on the go invoices
still not what i need!!. this is not what i need as an accountant to handle quickbooks functions on the go. why can't we just have access to the full functionality of quickbooks online? i still can enter bills to be paid or checks to be printed. these are two of the most important functions i handle for my clients. let me know when i can get it all!
crashes, not usable, nexus 5x. crashes and no longer usable on a stock nexus 5x on android 6.0.1. app is now useless to me on my phone which is a major problem.
worse and worse with every update.. the more recent the update, the worse this app runs. worked great until they changed to a new platform and now it's slower then ever. to logging in or saving pictures out in the field, it takes an additional 20 mins on the job site just waiting for quickbooks.
. installed on android yesterday. cannot see anything on dashboard. called customer service and they don't know anything about the issue and can't help. she said she can see it on her iphone. account can be seen on desktop version but the mobile app is useless.
. really nice
awful app  doesn’t fully sync with online data. i keep getting notifications about a 6 month overdue invoice, which i used for testing. however, when you try and remove the invoice, it can’t find it. the online version is fine if a little overpriced for soletrader business, but this app, which costs nothing, is worth exactly that. it’s next to useless.
best financial app for nonfinance people. the most user friendly, cutting edge, accessible and collaborative financial app you can find which is affordable and does the job with least amount of financial knowledge.
no support from quickbooks is brutal. there's no support options provided from quickbooks directly. that's a very poor customer experience, especially when paying $100s per year for this platform. the online community is somewhat helpful, but you're relying on contributions from other random users being accurate, which they may not be. please step up, quickbooks.
great app. qbo is a fantastic app for small business. it makes balancing the books easy and less time consuming than the old paper method. it syncs with your business accounts making the job of keeping track of your business accounts easy. you can get a snapshot of your business's finances, balance sheet, p & l from the report tab on the app.
super functional..extremely helpful. quick books app is fantastic! makes using my phone for invoicing and estimates very easy! recommend to anyone..... no glitches, no hang ups..... you won't be disappointed!
. no option to cancel subscription! don't subscribe!
does what i need. app is easy to navigate and has all functionality i am looking for.
. very handy
existing customers badly treated. this company refuse to permit existing customers to switch to (the less expensive) simple start package even when they meet all criteria. go elsewhere instead.
very limited!. i prepare weeks of invoices on my desktop for my 3 crews. unfortunately the online version rarely finds the invoices, and i end up having to go back to the old way of exporting pdf invoices. i feel like the desktop has so many flaws already, and the app is basically a worse version. i expect more from a legit company, but maybe i'm asking too much.
quickbooks. accounting app
app crashes on ios 9 and ios 10. when i click on support it takes you to a web page that also does not work properly. do you have email support ?
. great. great app. makes life easier.
. great app!!
. very good, i am on trial not sure how much full experience will cost, i'll update when i can
great for attaching receipts, not for entering expenses. i love being able to take photos of invoices and receipts and directly attach them to the expense. however, i am unable to add expenses because the app does not have access to my accounts or categories. if there was even a save as a draft option, i would give this a 55. however, i am not able to save any input if i can’t add the account or categories.
. very good experience, very helpful and pro
easy to learn and use. everywhere access, integrated bank and credit card transactions. easy to create transactions on the road.
. much easier than using the mobile site on my phone and very convenient for sending invoices
. very excited with qb, it become a breeze to navigate, and make my business very organized. love it.
updated review. try going to help & feedback and click refresh data. this may solve the receipts not savingsyncing on mobile issue and for touch id and pin sign on, go to settings and switch to on. not sure if the setting stays on once you actually shut down the app.
app crashing. after updating to the new version, app is crashing. kindly resolve the issue. not able to use
worthy app, very user friendly !!. personally this app is unbelievable. it dose pretty much everything. however, it would be even better if you could set up folders in a name customer by you. second, it would be even better if you could access certain command requests without it buggingout. so far that has only happened once. otherwise it would have got five star.
. when it works it works great. however i have to periodically delete and reinstall the app because it gets buggy entering new expenses. it will get locked in the expense screen. in the locked screen if i hit save 5 times it will record the transaction 5 times while still sitting in the entry screen.
the best. buy an ipad. shred up your paper estimatesinvoicing. stop using pens. download this app. holy crap i've been in business 4 years and feel stupid after downloading this. plus u look awesome w an ipad. plus everything's stored forever.
adding a photo to a receipt should be simple. apparently there was a recent update that removed the add photo option to tranasactions. it's not there any longer. i called support and they tell me i have to create a note, add the photo to that note, then go find the transaction and add the note to it.
. square app is so much easier to navigate on mobile app. plus square has instant deposit. quick books i have to wait 2 buisness days at the least. horrible.
useless. why even bother with this app? i can enter a bill from a sub or supplier on the website or the mac app but can only enter paid expenses here? i can do everything i need to do with my business on my iphone without carrying an ipad or macbook air except use the quickbooks app to enter or actually pay bills (only able to record bills already entered as paid). please fix this (or just tell us you’re not fixing it) !!!
doesn’t work like the app on a pc. the fact that the apps are not the same on a pc than on the ipad or mobile is frustrating. can’t see running totals on the register, can’t add transactions the same way, etc. and the kicker is the website version doesn’t work at all on the ipad, can’t scroll through the register because scroll bars are absent in chrome or safari. horrible adaptation and makes the ipad useless to conduct accounting business with quickbooks...
most of the buttons don’t work anymore. how could you make something this bad? buttons like accept transfer do not work. if this this was any more of a dog, it would shed. wake up and fix this over priced piece of poop!
not intuitive, not flexible, once in your stuck. terrible decision for a simple accounting software. converted from computer version...very unhappy.
. very easy and quick to use, would like to be able to access my invoices and stuff on a browser though
excellent. i love the immediate accessibility of our business's financial position. no need for me to meet with the bookkeeper and accountant nearly as often. i haven't had any issues with the app.
good. i wish i had full functionality for everything. great way to pull up an invoice on the fly.
. great software. so easy to use and very reliable.
awesome interface. awesome app. that's what it says it will do. the only problem is when i log an expense it attaches receipts as images and not as pdfs. also i do not like the image scanner it doesn't trim around the edges of the receipt. i end up having to use a pdf scanner and then attach the receipt in quickbooks online in a browser.
awesome app. this app really helps me keep track of all my transactions for my pool business. easy to use and has everything i need.
hvac. allows me to estimate, invoice and collect right on site. i don't need all the extra reports payroll, not as this point. so great for my company.
fixed bags. quick response in fixing the bags on ios 9. will keep you update....
disappointed. i work a lot with the browser version of qbo which is really excellent. unfortunately, the ipad version is far from good... when we talk about cloudconnected application, i expect to have the same functionalities whatever is the system used. wrong design...
not easy to do it all on app. find trying to complete and send vat return a headache. also we use coop bank doesn’t tie up with qb nor does it with starling business bank
great software. i have come to really like quick books online. quoting, invoicing, reports and my personal favourite... it links with your bank account to automate expense inputs. you set the rules once and the next time a similar transaction appears in your linked bank account it automatically categorises the transaction for you, just hit 'add'. saves me so much time and effort and to me it's fast becoming a business tool i simply wouldn't be without.
so useful.... i don't really use it like it's designed. i have 50 company trucks & 5 semi trucks to keep track of at our repair shop. this allows me to document everything. each vehicle as a customer with year & type always easy to find. each invoice acts as a repair, allows me to document every detail and track costs. luv this app! well worth the subscription fee.
almost useless. the app is good for sending invoices only. don't expect to be able to do any other business on the app. the mobile site is about as good as healthcare.gov. you can look at some things but forget everything else. again good for sending invoices only. i expected more from a established company.
chief operating officer. phenomenal software.
nothing quick about quick books. not easy and not quick. out of all the invoice apps i’ve used this has been the most awkward
check payment image. i wish if i can take of the customer check payment image and with in it on the app. both of them times it’s hard to search for invoice number and when customers overpay the system does not stop them and the refund process is so difficult.
poor reporting. not very happy. only report is p and l and can't change from accrual to cash to see exact position. cannot see any nominals or account info disappointed
lot of scope for improvement. finding a lot difficult to access even the simple features like search etc. hopefully the updates will take care of it.
j'adore!!!. tout simplement super! l'application est facile à utiliser. très pratique de pouvoir faire des factures directement chez nos clients et pouvoir leur envoyer par courriel en direct!
won't save receipts. try to record receipts in expenses, just get error message. called the number the message had, person they don't offer support for mobile devices or their app.**** update i did as you requested the day you requested and to date have not heard back from your staff. same issue with samsung 10.1 tablet and s6 phone.
the application for the tablet. the application for my ipad tablet does not let me see checks i have written that have not cleared. (it does show my account balance) i like the online version but i for the life of me don’t know why the internet based application does not work on my ipad plus and their application for ipads is simply said  horrible.
. love the app, makes running my business so much easier.
no employee section. this app contains nothing to help your employees, only the business manager. quick books could’ve at least added support for timesheets and such since they no longer allow you to save your timesheet in mobile browsers.
. love this app!! so simple and extremely convenient.
. generally a good piece of software... but, if you happen to get an unusual glitch don't expect much help. two of our invoices have been resent to a client 3040 times per day for the last four months. my customer is upset and my bookkeeper has wasted days of time on hold or explaining the exact same situation to countless tech support. come on @intuitbrad is this the best your team can do?
. qbo much improved over original launch product, and tge app has brought qbo up.to date. i love the ability to upload receipts tgat immediately sync with qbo and match to vendorsexpenses. qbos ability to have multiple ysrs working simultaneously is huge . realtime collaboration with my bookkeeper and accountant is now easy. no more thirdparty file sharing apps and concerns about version control. with the app i can now monitor financials on the fly. highly recommend!
. no longer working at all on my phone which is how i do 95% of my business. nobody to call or get a hold of to fix the problem since it is a 3rd party app.
. top app easy to use.
. where do i start. purchased to help with accounts for small self employment business. did not upload new transactions from bank account or paypal as advertised on app or the full site. mileage tracker was not accurate. user interface too basic. so frustrating as i would use this constantly but as it does not upload my transactions properly, it is unusable. far too glitchey as an app. wish i had done free trial and not wasted money on it.
keeps on crashing. i have uninstalled and reinstalled and it still isn't working. keeps on stopping after i enter my username and password. please help.
worth the buy!!!!. quickbooks mobile has made estimates and invoicing so much easier! definitely with the buy for any small business!
. not for indian. can register as i am from india
great invoicing app. works great for invoicing needs.
happy but need a little help on a question. i like the app. i can’t seem to get the job address or shipping address to show up on the invoice... it s a big concern for me.
quickbooks online keeps me up to date. i am able to get my business information at my fingertips. i can copy receipts and invoice customers in 2 clicks. fast and simple!
difference maker. love the program, made it much easier to price jobs, track paidunpaid invoices and keeps track of all business info
sssloooow so very slow. latest update takes forever to load splash screen about 8 seconds then face id happens fast then loading data: no problems. just takes for ever on the front side to get going.
it's great. enjoy this app
qb mobile. we use it at our retail location. love the integration the mobile app gives. its a nice feeling to know i'm always on the same sheet of music no matter where i'm at. excellent !
". made an payment 3 days ago and still getting an error ""subscription error"" ereceipt sent. update, it's been 5 days and i'm still locked out of my account after payment was made. quickbooks has offered to transfer payment method directly to them. google play informed me that quickbooks refuses to refund my subscription, while quickbooks denies that that is the case. fyi been a quickbooks user for 3 years now, and never had an issue, til now."
needs improvement. i love the desktop version but my app version and even the online version never works right! there is always something that doesn't work. i always go through the whole estimate or invoice and then it won't save it for me! very frustrating and i wish they could work out all of the kinks.
. takes hours for a verification email with pin to get sent. i can't wait that long before i can access my accounting!
exceptional. this is incredible intuitive software that keeps you completely up to date. it saves hours of time. this is very easy to use. highly recommend for every business owner.
love but.... great! except would love to be able to make a deposit with the app
qbo online (android). overall an effective and efficient application; and the price was a little cheaper through google play then through intuit online. the only function i wish was there is the mileage tracking, as it is in the qb self employed.
. awesome app
improving phase one detsiling. awesome app to help budget and keep my finances straight. the one feature that i love is how our customers are not only sync online on our computer but also our iphones and android lg tablets. that is priceless
. brilliant app, very easy to use even for beginners. also has great customer support for your problems and queries.
can't edit customers. you can make new customers but once one is in there you can't edit them unless i go to my pc
owner. its great doing my acct on the go, staying current. great mobile app adding more features all the the time!
. the best they have really improved on the app. definitely worth the money.
so easy to use!. i hate accounting, so this app makes my life so easy!
just started. i just started my business and only had a few transactions. when i downloaded qb online it was simple and everything reconciled perfectly. it's easier then the old software too which i am use to using.
broken in ios 13. need a fix urgently
quickbooks scheduler. we love quickbooks and how well it works in the field. we got the gopayment as well. the only thing i wish quickbooks would add is a scheduler for jobs open, accepted, and estimates pending.
fácil de usar. muy buena herramienta para administrar mi negocio👍🏼
. love this app!!
. i found it absolutely amazing, my team are starting to use it and they love it. reduced our time to monitor our income by a whopping 75%! we have also downloaded it into our tablets, iphones and can view and monitor and action it online and on the go, glad i bought the app!
. in usable black screen comes for a long long time in start up and during usable on android. the worst party is that issue has been there since ages. it's like qbo is not interested in developing this app
love it. i am an accountant and this is the software i use and recommend to all of my customers.
terrible customer service and often outages. terrible customer service and often outages. if you have a problem you're on your own because there are no numbers to call or anybody to message. it's only faqs
. good app, but please can you add mode of payment to sale receipts and receive payment. anytime i do sale receipt on the app, it post the cash directly to undeposited fund account i created instead of bank account of cash and cash equivalent that i created... please help us fix this pls
great for business. it's great that you can send invoices from phone. it would be even greater if it had a deposit feature. that way when you're at the bank you can just look on the app and see and check off your deposits from undeposited funds.
. great app trying to start a small business this is very helpful thanks
pretty basic and useless. can't do a lot of things. it's very very basic , pretty much a basic overview of your account. you can’t do anything even as detailed as seeing the transactions in a pl report. it’s only broad overview stuff and entering new transactions. can’t even switch cash vs accrual. severely limited and cannot work in a pinch when you can’t use an actual computer.
crashes all the time. no matter what version this is, it always crashes on me. i never use this this app, although it would be fantastic if i could.
. partial capability cant load expenses in the droid version but can on the apple version. expense management is important. a small thing that has a big impact. wouldnt take much to do and make it five stars.
. if you even subscribe to their free trial, they will call you dozens of times in a day. its too much. every time a new number, so i can't get rid off. heavy spamming. जीना हराम कर रखा है यार तुम लोगों ने
best in the business!. im a general contractor, tracking and allocating expenses is easy, i take a picture of the receipts with my phone and stays stored in the cloud, really cool. i like it a lot
impressed. i put off upgrading to online version after using quickbooks pro for five years, struggling to enter online direct debit expenses and payments. online version makes entering data easy and efficient. such a time saver for me. well done intuit! definitely worth the monthly subscription fee.
. awesome app
so happy. awesome app
user friendly. come from using myob. quickbooks is easy to use, calculates gst, bas and invoices. highly recommend.
partial functionality. every time i need to produce or view an invoice qb says i need to use web version because of register items that cannot be viewed. so basically ios version is not productive.
super awesome tool. best app you can get so you have total control over your accounts
bad customer service and bad app. i’m use only one month is the most terrible app. never used this app
banking synchronisation. the level of failure is becoming unacceptable. every update from quickbooks results in failure. then there are the occasions when the bank upgrade and qb does not. we rely on you to make it work seamlessly and always.
. i have called customer support twice now. each time, i am greeted by an overly friendly person who barely speaks a word of english. either time was the agent able to even understand what i am asking for. they could offer no help, they would not transfer me to someone else. i am left all alone here trying to navigate a program and run a business. i have no idea how to get any help from these people. thank goodness for youtube!
great app. this is very handy when running a business on the go.
okay. i'm new to doing my own bookkeeping and find this product clunky and not very easy to use. issues with importing transactions and program changing dates and the order compared to the bank. it's not very easy to see what account transfers are moving tofrom. it's hard to distinguish credits for debits. poor customer service. no good summary graphs. slow to attach receipts. multiple clicks to do basic things. cuts off file names if there too long.
very good app.. really like this app.
it's ok not super. i'd like to have the ability to creat checklists and forms that aren't effectively invoice like. i also don't like intuit screwing with their databases and allowing some invoices and expenses to go missing from my account.
where is the expense part of the app?. i want to take a photo of receipts in android app and upload! where is it? my husband can do it from his iphone, but my samsung s4 doesn't have an expense button with the camera etc..,
awesome. such a great package. it made my life so easy with the phone app that i can raise invoices and quotes on the go. it also makes your business look heaps bigger and professional by having proper invoicing that allows taking signature on quotes too. loving it.
. makes my job easier.
helpful app 😊. so far very satisfied with this app. able to record expenses and deposits on the go and quickly. less time spent doing tedious book work. two thumbs up! 👍🏻👍🏻
employees. was charge $30 for three months for payroll, which i was not using. called the payroll department and they took care of me: refunded the cash into my account without question.
. awesome awesome app.. could use the date option for invoices though
great to app to have. loving the app. i would give it 5 stars if it was able to function the same or close to the online version.
ios 13. app crashes before opening! please fix asap!
". 6.10.19  i hate it. you can't do ""billable"" expenses from the app. you cant edit invoices that have been sent. terrible. i hate it. 8.12.19  still hate it. noone has ""investigated""my situation. 👎👎 12.5.19. yup.. still hate it. i use it but cringe every single time i open it. pos app. zero stars"
credit note cis. you cannot issue a matching credit note for an invoice with cis deduction, despite speaking to qb for over 2 hours they admitted they dont know how to do it.
. the easiest, simpliest accounting cloud system ever ..
good if you use quickbooks for limited functions. lacks access to a lot of what exists in the full browser experience. particularly frustrating that not only can you not create a po, you cannot view them. other simple stuff missing or not quite matched up as far as fields being available for adding products, suppliers, customers etc. in light of them increasing their monthly subscription fees, hopefully some money is going to be spent bringing feature parity to their access tools.
worst ever app. i have no idea why is this app on app store. the moment i sign in it says your session is expired and you need it sign in again. thats the only vicious circle of time wastage is what this app has to offer its customer. worst experience ever
. userfriendly, can create bills and estimation from mobile app too
". mobile app is full of bugs, recent ""update"" has now made it so my account is unable to sync and wont let me log in. not very useful for my mobile business. tried reinstalling the app, still no luck."
bugs and bugs it a jungle. 1. kicking out of the app very often. 2. not able to email multiple invoices at one time. 3. limited search capabilities. cant search notes and description. :(
would be great if…. this app would really be a great app if it woukd have all the functions as on the pc. for exsample i wanted to issue an invoice with a different currency, and the app blocked it and sent me to the pc. so for what is this app good if we have to go to the pc for almost each transaction?
it desont sync. disappointed it desont sync with qbo, tried the settings to refresh the data but still no luck!
expenses. how do add an expense thats on a 30 or 60 day account?
keeps locking up. the app keeps telling me i need to update to the latest version, but i already have it. it won't let me log on. frustrating. please fix or revert back to previous version until glitches are fixed.
. very disappointed, missing 6 months of transactions from my bank, tried to fix it as i was instructed to but couldn't, you can't get someone to speak to, no customer service. big joke, i don't recommend it to anyone
nice app.
. can't print invoices should have a print invoices if on home network
great app!!. use this daily with my lawn carelandscape business. the only addition i would like to see is the ability to enter delayed charges. as we service each lawn, it would be huge to be able to input the charge for the work rather than do everything at the end of the day. otherwise, no issues at all.
signed out automatically. every time i launch the app it signs me out and i have to log in over and over. please fix this issue. it is annoying.
. makes my job so much easier!
convenient. the mobile features are easy to use. still getting it organized. i'll update as i get more familiar with it.
. very useful app
best choice for modern businesses. quickbooks online (qbo) could be a challenge for those resistant to change, or those not looking to grow their business. but for business owners hungry for dynamic, realtime financial data to both interpret and grow their businesses, qbo is key. the combination of qbo and integrated applications (tailored to your specific industry and workflow) aid in gaining efficiencies which eliminating redundancies, manual data entry and a few other timesaving and (human error) opportunities. highly recommended.
great tool for self employed small business owners. easy to use and easy to navigate
buggy. since updating to the latest version i can’t view invoices from the home screen or even update and send invoices from the invoices screen. hire some competent engineers.
great!. as a first time business owner and user of any accounting software, i am very happy with quickbooks on the whole and this app in particular. easy to use and understand without over simplifying what needs to be done. seamless integration without just about any software make this a great goto for all your small business accounting needs.
. not support in india
great business tool. this program has helped me i the field like no other program i can think of.
owner eleganttouchlimos llc. the best off best. quick book i ben used last 4 years the make my busnise everything easy. invoice custumer and recipts i like it thank you so much. good job
i like everything but..... i like qbo a lot. however there is at least one very big flaw and that is that you cannot make past due or partial tax payments through qbo.

great app!. i was using quickbooks pro desktop 2013 before going to online 2016. all i can say is wow! i never realized how much i was missing. reconciling expenses with automatic bank and credit card transaction downloads can be done on my phone anywhere and anytime. no need to log into bank and manually download. huge time saver. also keeps me up to date on my finances with great reporting built in and at my fingertips.
nice having qb in your pocket. easy to operate in the field and keep the paper work down at night. hopefully in time more functionality will be added.
five stars!. has helped out tremendously when it comes to my business. it makes it so much easier to use then the paper receipt books. it helps me stay organized and keeps me updated to the second. thanks quickbooks!
can't wait for more!. yeah, it's not going to be the only way you use quickbooks. but having the opportunity to have a mobile capability is immensely helpful. it's how you use it and when to that makes this app great!
best business app!. so easy to use!! very clear info and graphs make it quick and easy to check your profit and loss and see exactly where you spend money and where the most income is coming from!
great program. quickbooks online has become the way we operate our business. it went from being an accounting system to doing work orders, job tracking and everything in between.
love it. i love this app, just doing what i want
. office on the go! i run a tree service so i'm never in the office. this app let's me take care of businesses while in the field and frees up time when i get home at night.
capable. qbo mobile is quite useful for billing customers on site and checking some basic information.
new version problems. ever since the last update, i can no longer categorize and add income and expense from the app. it seems the buttons to “add” do not work.
does what i need it to. it works, and has made me more efficient.
new update crashes constantly. can’t login. crashed every time. have tried reinstalling without any luck. also, you can’t customize or get payment alerts for qbo except through the app. so until this is fixed, i’m stuck checking daily to see who’s paid and when. pain in the butt. please fix asap.
frustrated. very difficult to make adjustments and when receiving a payment i have not found a way to receive cash as will as a card on the same invoice. frustrated
useless. app is slow and hard to use.
changed my life for the (much) better!. want to send an estimate in the time that it takes your barista to make your coffee? the amount of time that i save managing my business on my phone has cut my desktime in half. i couldn't be happier!
great for keeping up with receipts!. instead of having to carry around all of the business receipts that i use, i'm able to take a quick shot with my camera upload it and then i'm all digital.
very weak. i have been a quickbooks user for years but the app is just weak. employee transactions are not possible and reports are minimal. i consider these critical aspects of good accounting software and they almost do not exist in the app. i don’t need an app to write an invoice or figure out that someone owes me money. however, keeping track of my reporting to the government and paying employees is critical and these do not exist in the app.
very handy little app. as said in other reviews it is a little different from the computer version but it is such an easy way for me to do my invoices on the go! it's all set to go and it tracks all of my invoices and sends me reminds of unpaid one too! great little helper!
. have not upgraded since 2006, this app is great. i am not tied to the office for alot of tasks that used to only be done in the evening.
"won't open. download twice. when i try to log in says i ""need to make payment or my account has been canceled"", which isn't true. i open it on my laptop just fine and have automatic payments. what gives?!!"
nothing adds up. when you run a business you want your numbers correct. i don't have time to troubleshoot why your software can't add a simple paypal balance and leaves transactions out. your fired!
"review. i have been using quickbooks since the start of my business, and have found it to be extremely useful!! i don't have one bad thing to say about quickbooks, other then for some reason, which no reason was given to me, i'm not able to set up the ""accept payment"" option it offers. if i could activate that feature i would give quickbooks 5 stars. until then they have a 4 star review from aj's tree service!!"
. easy to use app. does basic invoicing like it should. i wish i could get more detail for my costs with the online version like i can with the desktop version.
slow to use on ipad. i have found quickbooks slow & frustrating to use on my work ipad it takes a long time to load pages.
must have !!!. if you have a business that serves customers and you want to collect payment at time of service or later, you want this software along with its phone apps to do business in the field. your a fool if you don't !!!!
👍. excellent app!
app like. blue
awesome app!:. this is perfect for on the go invoices and quotes for businesses.
app is good support is horrible. call qb for basic questions lady name amanda hang up on me.. dial back in the she place me on hold for 15 minutes
. very limited features and too slow. even after 6 months of using they've not provided the payment gateway integration as available in others. no one handles the queries seriously after 5pm on phone call.
adding a photo to a receipt should be simple. apparently there was a recent update that removed the add photo option to tranasactions. it's not there any longer. i called support and they tell me i have to create a note, add the photo to that note, then go find the transaction and add the note to it.
. when editing an invoice, it doesn't let you scroll up to see the whole written document when your keyboard is open. galaxy s6. great other than that.
. this app is extremely slow, to the point of being unusable. the bank feed is ridiculously slow, anf accepting transactions lags terribly.
current update just crashes. ios10 with the new update on ipad don't work. app opens then immediately closes.
recurring payments.. i really wish i could set up recurring payments from the app and also delete invoices
easy to use. well set out and easy to use
they do not fix bugs at all.. constant new annoying bugs that have been around for years now. i have written multiple times to help make them aware, now i have been writing complaints and still no fixes. am literally logging into the app every single time i open it. i have to use this app for my work. no choice. but if you have a choice then you should choose literally any other app. this company is terrible.
must have for small business. i love the app is easy to use and easy to monitor business finances
. i would like to use on my laptop and can not, it won't let me use it here, only on my phone or tablet where i originally signed up for use. i can't do all that work from my phone and i don't want to. if i can't use on my laptop, i will have to cancel my subscription
great app. great app saves time works well recommend for chippys like myself :)
. user friendly
. makes up time, and easier to keep up with.
very disappointing. very limited subset of the online product. the fact that i can't see all my normal reports makes no sense. and can't log in through the browser, so ipad is pretty useless tool for quickbooks. funny thing is that there is beta version for iphone that is more functional. wish it worked on ipad.
. great app makes things easier
superbly designed. having used two competitors' products before, i've been very pleasantly surprised with quickbooks. it's really easy to use but, at the same time, it has lots of really helpful features. the app is well designed but my only gripe is that i am sometimes unable to login. the problem usually corrects itself after a while, but it's a bit annoying when i need it at the time. nevertheless, the product is so good that this doesn't even bother me much.
quick books. very useful and excellent application
keeps crashing. app doesn’t work . no updates in months
simply outstanding. i'm floored by the convenience and utility of this app. good work, intuit!
. very handy for a lanscaper on the go. now i can email invoices as soon as we are finished right from my smartphone, wether i'm standing next to the customer or in the truck. makes my life easier
wish i could charge cards on file. love the app, just wish i could input new customer's card information and charge the existing customer's cards on file when accepting payments so i could do my accounting from anywhere.
. i love this app i love this app even more now because i'm able to bill my customers almost as soon as i am done the work.
doesn't let you attach items. ....... yep, doesn't let you attach items. wtf?
what a joke.. can't add notes to customers. buggy! cant print. awful. if you are moving from qb desktop, think again! there's not even an easy way to just view today's business. no reports in app. useless.
pace trailer repair. qbo
ios 13; don’t do it!. if you need this app to work correctly do not upgrade to ios 13 yet! many bugs... my worst bug: can’t look at any customer info anymore, does not work. yes i uninstalled and reinstalled...
trouble with ipad app. hello, i have the app in my iphone and it works great, but i have downloaded the app in the ipad and it tells me: looks like your account doesn’t include access to the quickbooks online mobile app... what i need to do to have access?. please advice! thanks
. used to be fantastic now all you get it duplicated invoices, inability to sync with the cloud and invoice saves that can take over 30 mins to finalise! hopeless...
. love being able to work in quickbooks from my phone! one of the best features is being able to take a picture of your receipt and attach it to your expenses right from your phone. makes your bookkeeping incredibly easy! wonderful customer service, love the payroll, too many good things to say about this app.!
not for the ipad or iphone. the app does not support stp... have to access using web browser on ipad iphone . so don’t buy the app if you want to use it for stp. browser access using an ipad pro , you won’t be able to scroll down or access command icons because they are beyond the margins of the ipad screen. can’t finish inputting categories because the screens won’t scroll at all
broken app. unusable. going on over a week like this. killing my ability to invoice customers while mobile, which is the only reason i chose the online version that i pay for every month! intuit is not intuitive, they're only into your money.
excellent. i am a pro exterminator and i have been using this app since i launched my company federal bug investigators in 2012. it's features are amazing and allow me to create an invoice, charge a card on the spot and more, while out in the field or away from the office. thanks to this technology i am an elite entrepreneur.
great & uptodate!. this is a great little app to give you access into the back end of your quickbooks online account. great for doing simple invoicing and adding expenses. i still use the desktop browser for more complicated reports and such. well done and intuit keeps the app up to date thank you!
money grabber. quickbooks will offer subscription service. i paid for it because of the discount and then they didnt allow me to accept payments through their app. you have to assess the profile first before asking for payment.
great app!. very useful, but i think it still needs some work. very limited, need to offer more functions.
used to work. this last update has my app crashing and signing me out almost every time i use it. usually this is fixed quickly but it’s been a while now. please update the app so it’s doesn’t crash on the iphone x
can't live without it. i don't know how i did business before this app. i love that i can access my company books anywhere. i love the way i can take a photo of the receipts for my expenses. thank you qb!
just barely ok.. app has multiple issues . with page format. browser must use google chrome to get all options . called 3 times , on phone over hour each time . weeks later still nothing fixed . app is very limited .. customer service is a joke . here i thought i was upgrading to a better software . lol i was so wrong ..
when i am done, i am done!. as a contractor i love to do my estimates one time, hit convert to invoice one time, hit receive payment one time and i am done with my paperwork and money is heading my way before i leave the job site. when i get home i can just spend time with the family rather than swim through paperwork. great service!
when it works it’s great. this app will not recognize my credentials even as i use the online version. i wish it were reliable and i was able to use it consistently. even reinstalling the app does not fix the problem. intuit needs to focus on making this app work on a regular basis as you pay for this service.
no activity?. none of my vendors have any activity (transactions) available within this app. almost rendering it completely useless in our business.
excellent online software. i love this system made my job a lot easier my phone is my office
report must show sales receipts as well. reports must show sales receipts as well and not only invoices. qb allows you to generate sales receipts for customers who paid at the point of sale, hence the report functionality in the app must show these receipts as sales otherwise, the whole report is meaningless. also, more basic reports are needed such as p&l, balance sheet, suppliers, transactions....etc. thx anyway.
stay well away!. worst software i have used to date. zero customer service. ignores all complaints. takes forever to load. constant problems. not user friendly.
. be warned easy to subscribe almost impossible to cancel subscription has been at it for hours it seems like an undertaking of several days will try again tomorrow.
decent....but needs work. the mobile app is laid out decent and does work well for the most part. biggest problem i have is you cannot access product quantities or make any purchase orders with the mobile app. need to fix that.
. this app helps me out alot i really like it.
expense and banking. until these two options are available this app is of little use.
highly functional for an app. unlike other folks i find that i can get the majority of what i need to accomplish for daytoday business done on this app. very user friendly.
. very easy and fun to use. i had to check it out before i buy it. well worth it
quickbooks mobile app. greatest addition to my business i ever made!
no purchase orders. as of feb 2015, i'm unable to find a way to create purchase orders from this app. without the ability to raise orders for inventory, i cannot run my business, so the app is useless for me. seems handy, so i wish it worked properly.
. for an app qbo is awesome. it does not have all the features of a desktop program but what app does? you guys are doing an incredible job and making impovements to both program and app all the time.
quickbooks online. very good application and it's a very matured application, if only it can support arabic text it will be very suitable to people in this region as well.
works but needs more.... i would have given 5 stars if i was able to record deposits through the app.
business owner. it's much easier than desktop version
. an absolute must for small business.. and seek advice from tech support before assuming. functionality isn't there. ive had no problems... gives me confidence in my books
great app. 👍🏼
good apps. it's okay
crashes when downloading. crashes when downloading after initial setup. have not been able to use app. disappointing.
great app. removed and reinstalled the app on my iphone. works fine
. best app
great!. continues to impress and improve on this very useful app. i use it daily for bids, invoices and expenses. the addition of the ability to record expenses and photograph receipts has made my life so much more easy. and to be able to quickly add clients, easy estimates and quick invoices and finally receive payments is unbelievable and wonderful.
qb app fail. app is very frustrating. sometimes works great but most of time wants to download company data and 15 min later still not downloaded. i try over and over and give up. then every once in awhile it works. fix or get rid of.
. great app, easy to use, very helpful to track your expenses
viewable. error message on download is gone, but the app lacks functionality like syncing bank data and the payroll app doesn't allow me employee editing options. if i need to see what is happening in quickbooks its all right, but it's definitely not quickbooks online mobile version
. started a new business, had to find a way to manage my capital going in and out, also was able to send invoices directly to my customers, do quotes and look at profits. just a great app! perfect for me
mobile invoice and so much more. great app!.
great business app. i truly do not know where my business would be without this app.
not enough!. this app does not have the functionality that qbo has. therefore, useless. if we can't use the ipads in the store, what use is the app? 1. can't enter an invoice with the details 2. can't enter a vendor bill and do splits. 3. can't put payments in undeposited funds. 4. yep, useless.
please: give us delayed charge already!. a new update, and still no delayed charge feature. how many times do we have to ask? for the love of gawd, why can i not add a delayed charge on the mobile app?????? this is something you actually want to do when you're at a client, not get them to sign for an invoice every time you visit them during the month.
great app. it works great
. :) very good app. i do all my invoicing from my phone or tablet.
top notch app for businesses. makes it so easy to run my business on the go!!!!
error!. somthing isn’t working and there is no support from the developer online :
. it is a cool app
works great. works great for my small business. not sure why there are bad reviews, qbo keeps up with my customers information, invoices, and estimates. very easy to use. now on this last update, i did have to uninstall and reinstall on my andriod phone, but within 5 minutes i was back up and running.
victoria. love this.
"great app!. easy to use and good customer service. i used the ""chat online"" service. very helpful and especially like that i can email a copy of the chat conversation to myself."
mick's mowing & gardening. great app very easy to use and very helpful to my business
good for on the go business#. great app for mobile business. lacks some of the functionality of desktop version. i like the way i can record every transaction on the go, even invoices and payments. i don't like the fact that you can run only one business per subscription. much to expensive to pay separate for subscriptions if you have more than one business.
app constantly glitches and it's very slow. i've had so many issues with this app. lately it has been extremely slow, it randomly shuts down for no reason in the middle of inputting a transaction and it won't load larger invoices. i'm very disappointed as i use this on a daily basis for my business.
. great app and very simple to use. just what my construction company needed to be legit
brilliant. excellent accounting software for new small business. only issue i have is that i bought a subscription online and the app keeps telling me to subscribe
good application. very useful and handy app. thanks qb
makes life easy. haven't worked through 100% of the app but as of right now it has made accounting world easier. especially keeping up to date with bank account reconciliation.
doesn’t work for me in ios13. it doesn’t even get to the first page. tried uninstalling and reinstalling but same issue. please fix what is normally a decent app.
doesn't work. omg i'm so frustrated with this app...now it doesn't work at all on my note 5 i've report the error so many times and no reply
not reliable. is not reliable. not a replacement for desktop app or web based qb online. different icons, different navigation, missing tools reports and features. data does not reliably import into app from accounts.
. use qbo daily. this so is nice for quick lookups but is not fully functioning as qbo.
. great app
made business that much easier. amazing, don’t know how i kept track of my business before quickbooks.
estimate layout. i like the way the app works, i have problems when i need to include a lot of info on the estimates. when i send it it leaves the first page blank and cuts of some of the info on the second page. overall great though!
login error. useless if you can't even trust it to login properly.
great app, slow to make revisions. app works good 98% of the time, there are some things that i would change and they do not seem to be changing them
"good but not perfect.. a feature is missing that you get on the website for example, search i can't search invoices in the app through ""memo"". why!!!!??? please fix or add a ""memo"" search option, please!!!"
great app. great app for busy people! this is really useful for trades people and consultants. highly recommend, super easy to use
worst customer service. i love the idea of the app but it’s too confusing i don’t get a lot of the options and customer service i barely understood anything was no help at all. i just simply needed the app to track incomeexpense and personal pay.
extremely limited. no credit memos, you can't have a simple addition of how much you have to receive in open invoices at a specific date, no journal entries. i have only my ipad pro and if i try to access the web version, it's not compatible with any browser on ios. so you're stuck and you need a pcmac only for these things. it's a terrible, terrible experience.
access. this app is great. it is so nice to be out in the field looking at a project and make an estimate right then and there while things are fresh in your mind. not to mention for the quick service call we are able to make our invoice right there and present it when we are complete with the work. aloha po'okela lawn service kailua, hawaii
no support for canadian tax system. intuit's quickbooks for web does not support the canadian tax system. not sure why this app is appearing in the canadian app store.
. just unistalled and reinstalled the app hopefully it is going to work. after doing over 70 invoices it stopped working dashboard showed blank 😕
. limited bank support. no good for personal finance. not many german banks supported.
makes life easy. great app that makes accounting on the fly so simple.
app crashing ios13. app is crashing in io13
not working with ios 13. just crashes
business smooth. great app. keeps my business organized and in my hand.
. app isn't working, its getting crashed everytime i try to login
very easy to use. this app is extremely easy to use and very helpful.
. doesnt download data keeps stuck at the download screen. was told to send an email to john_quickbooks@gmail.com and have not heard back from that address. how do they not have an @quickbooksonline.com support email for this stuff?
. it truly has made my life easier when doing business with my customers!
keshav. it is a beautiful software. very flexible and user friendly. it made my work so simple. thanks to quick books!
decent.. the program is regularly requiring me to update my accounts and will not auto update and refresh my bank accounts. not as user friendly as i thought it would be.
charge by stealth. i downloaded this app to try it out. before i knew it i was being charged $4.99 per month. my understanding is that it is free with in app purchases, but i never subscribed to this. i abhor these types of sneaky apps. i recommend you don't download it, or if you do, be very careful.
thankful. i'm so thankful for quickbooks. i'm still learning a lot about it, but i don't think i would not survive without it. i started a small business 1 yr ago. i love the app! i'm always on the go and can access it from anywhere. highly recommended by us @ the hygienist helper, llc!
so easy.. i love using this app, it is a lot easier than the online webpage version. i love it.
. worth every penny. worth it's weight in gold! so thankful as a tiny business owner to have such a powerful, reliable, easy to use, affordable option such as quickbooks! it is truly a blessing to my business and i've only begun to learn all it can dohas to offer!
is ok. would like to see that an invoice has been sent to customer so i don't continue to add as i accumulate for that customer. would also like to see a statement with accumulative total and next invoice showing any outstanding amounts. but not bad app.
disappointed with android app. the pc version is so slick but the android version is very disappointing. as this is cloud based there should be no reason for such limited functionality. where do i enter my expenses when out working? if i had an iphone i would be able to. come on lets have similar functionality to the pc version.
. great app. makes it easier to run my business
rubbish. doesn't work. need to add bills but can't. how ridiculous to not have this function. deleted. no support from customer service
even worse after last update. didn't think the time loading could get any worse. i was wrong. ap is pretty much useless while with a customer. everything takes forever to load. need to sign in every. single. time. then you click out of the ap and right back in and it makes you use the touch id. super sucky. i very much dislike, yet i need to use it everyday. ugggggggg.
perfect for running small businesses, but...... everything you need to run a small business...but $35 is way to expensive, shouldn't cost more than $25! i’m very happy with the software and with a few dedicated hours i learned how to use it inside and out.
app times out occasionally during entry. app times out occasionally while i’m using it. when that happens it deletes the transaction i was working with.
. great app i love it
update is horrible!. i've been using qb online app for a long time. and it seem like the app finally had started to improve and now this latest update has caused some great frustration. i do not recommend updating totally get these glitches resolved.
brilliant. used other software apps before now and this one knocks socks off them, can access all my account details and add bills and send invoices so much easier during the day now, knocks about 30minutes a night off my admin
underdeveloped & terrible support. the software is totally undeveloped and does not have the features of the regular desktop version. tech support is horrific, they can't help because they don't have the knowledge. intuit had no business releasing the software to the public it's not even ready for beta yet. the iphone app is worthless!
". downloaded the app to be able to view estimates and invoices from phone while i'm away from my computer and someone calls wanting to know ""how much did we have in this job or that job"" well, the app is prettt useless when you have hundreds of estimates out and you're trying to find a particular one , but there is no ""search"" tool to look for what you're trying to find."
brilliant!. easy to use, matches payments received and ties them off with your invoices, easy to see profit and expenses for each month. well worth the monthly payment, my books have never been so easy to keep!
can't even create an account. american centred software. won't even accept uk mobile number when trying to sign up!! fail!
great app. very good photo function. so, no need to save receipt.
. love being able to do invoices in the field.
. well after the experience so far it's great when i need to merge all apps at home then i can rate better. customer service has been just awesome so far. thanks it makes tracking expenses easy as taking a picture and putting the irs info in.
"disappointing. if you also make ""mint"", why make your subscription service app so much worse? mint is great. this app is not."
very easy to use. the app works flawless. being able to sign in with biometrics, take photo of receipts and capture expenses quickly is one of the many great feature.
easy. great design, easy to use interface and great for quick overviews and adding data
. edit 12319: thanks for the fix and newer versions. this app has been updated and expanded to be a powerful tool on the go. crash problem fixed. love qbo i love that this app is a limited version of the qbo for your desktop browser: however, it crashes on start up all the time rendering it useless.
subscription ridiculous. this subscription crap is getting out of hand. what happened to the days when you could buy software and own it? as if quickbooks itself isn't expensive enough, and i would gladly pay once for a quickbooks android app, $125 a year is ridiculous. i don't need your cloud, i have a server of my own, why shove this crap down people's throats?
. dreadful experience so far. bought qb 16th dec 2019 and cant get a call back from an english speaker to help me with set up despite multiple attempts! why is sales uk based but support isnt? this is 2nd review  1st disappeared!!! so disappointed and very desperate to get started.
👌🏼. not a bad app
easy to work with. loving it
convenient, convenient, convenient!. as a small contractor always on the go this app is great with easy access to all my info. only downfall is lack of progress billing from an invoice, but i have found a work around.
engaged user who loves the product. team quickbooks, i think you have one of the better products on the market. i would really love to see payroll support on the app or available on mobile devices with your online product. i like the simplicity of your product and the user experience i think is better than others on the market. please deliver either a mobile browser supported payroll feature or even better a app solution now.....
desktop should be same as app. great app but a shame that the desktop version dies not have the same functionality
great app for on the go guys. great for the road warriors who are in the field working and don't have time to do office work
. not sure if emailing invoices work. so far real cool.
disappointed. i’ve been using the phone app for a year now. when the app works it is fine however it constantly freezes and my only option is to restart my phone. i have deleted and downloaded the app several times but it has not fixed the issues.
. nice but needs more. as a bookkeeper, i love quickbooks online because you can access it from anywhere. i like this app but wish i could deposit my payments and see my register. i'm so busy that it would be nice to do my personal business on the go instead of from my computer. i hope that these features will be available soon otherwise i will have to cancel after my 30 day free trial.
. while this app has a couple of problems, the benefits far outweigh the negatives. i would recommend it to anyone in business
. they said in your invoice that you can cancel anytime and it's not true! it has a glitch and i couldn't cancel it. make me lost two days trying to cancel it and then even charge me the month and did not give back my money. they went from 17 dollars a month to 40 dollars per month! don't never quickbooks
simple. très facile à utiliser
. amazing app
efficient. this app makes my life easier. has all the features i need to keep my business running smoothly.
best business app. quickbooks has definitely made running my business much more efficient and has made it easier to close on deals. the estimate tool makes it easy to send professional looking estimates to clients, and with a click, those estimates turn into invoices. you can receive payments through quickbooks as well. add the payroll service and you can run the whole business yourself. i would definitely recommend this to any new business start up.
. keeps my accountant happy 😇
. easier then i thought and there's always someone to help. highly recommend for your start up, or for new business owners like myself. 👍👍
some good some bad. have had several issues. mostly the program is easy to learn, use and navigate. the issues i have had are not easily resolved. they take time to fix and information for fix are not easily navigated. i do feel that it is safe to use.
best business app. very quick, no bugs or errors. love it!!!
decent....but needs work. the mobile app is laid out decent and does work well for the most part. biggest problem i have is you cannot access product quantities or make any purchase orders with the mobile app. need to fix that.
problem with update please fix. iphone x, after updating the app, it doesn’t let me edit any transactions at all, i can only approve what is recognized transaction, an unrecognized transaction is not responsive to touchscreen commands so i have to cancel edit. please fix
unusable. doesn’t connect to my account.. every time i try to login it says there is no company associated with my account. it works fine through a mobile browser or desktop browser. the app is completely unusable, how convenient. tech support says there is a glitch...you don’t say.
. very usefull app
great app. this app is great and it supports an even greater cloudbased accounting programme, i wish i had started to use it sooner. it is making my life so much easier.
saves time = saving money. great way to save time in keeping track of your business expenses and income. worth every penny for me saves me about 48 hours a week in managing my books and business.
. great app very convenient and allows me to manage my accounts on the road. i have a business where i am always out driving and the app saves me a lot of time & it allows me to get things done while i'm out of the office.
excellent app. i cannot tell you how much time i'm saving now. i wish i had changed to online years ago.
terrible to customers. your website deleted my account, which i spent hours putting together, and had every intention of subscribing and paying for this service, and then when i spoke with customer service to see what happened, i was told to call two other numbers for the same service, then placed on hold by the final number for 510 minutes, and was hung up on. they had my number and never called me back. horrible service to your customers. i will pursue a different company.
19.11.2 awful update. first thing i noticed was there is no search bar for customers, so i have to scroll through thousands of customers to find the one i’m looking for. secondly, i had hoped that we’d be able to view estimates and invoices in landscape mode to see them better, nope. then, when i tried to navigate back to the main customer list, there’s no back button! this version was nowhere near ready to be released.
hate this app. waste of data & time too
not happy with new update. new update has made navigating to the chart of accounts very annoying. you have to access one of 3 accounts (determined by qbs) that show up on the main page and then push the back button, magically the accounts list appears. poor design, but a simple fix. i don’t mind that the menu button has moved to the bottom, just please add a “chart of accounts” link. thanks.
not bad. convenient app. not as functional as quickbooks online, but it adds to its subscription's value.
l hill,president, ceo. at roomsaround campus llc, we use quickbooks all day long to handle our rental properties. tenants can get up to the minute information on their account and we know exactly where we stand fiscally. but what i really love is that rent payment which are sent out automatically, electronically with a link to the intuit payment network, are posted automatically. wow, what a time saver. oh, and the support is fantastic too.
. for running my little business and sending invoices on the fly its great!
excellent!!!. this is easy to use and very convenient! most of the functionality on the app means it's easy to work will out of the office!
does what it should. gets more inuitive with every update.. i am in better control of my business than ever.
marcela hayden. i don’t know how i would get buisness done with out quickbooks, and the app on the go makes it possible for my family to run our buisness and grow in success. thank you quickbooks
. dreadful experience so far. bought qb 16th dec 2019 and cant get a call back from an english speaker to help me with set up despite multiple attempts! why is sales uk based but support isnt? this is 2nd review  1st disappeared!!! so disappointed and very desperate to get started. i can login to qb online but says im in usa not uk please tell me who to email in response qb
great app  easy to use. enough said. it helps me keep track of my invoicing as well as my expenses. great for small businesses.
. great way to write and send invoices in the field
"mostly useful. i like having access to my business via my smartphone, however not all features are available (reports) and some calculations don't seem to work properly. after adding payment for clients, the invoices entered afterward are not automatically attached to said payment  even though the overall balance on the account is recalculated. the invoices sit and show as ""unpaid"" even though the account balance is at zero."
extremely limited. to be honest, this app does almost nothing i would want it to do. if all you want to do is record payments or call a business contactgreat. if you actually want to keep up with your business (banking, reports, employees, payroll, etc) on the go, this app is near useless. i can't imagine why you would pay to use this. even free i am deleting right away so it doesn't waste any more of my time or space.
down graded. from april this app is unusable. i down graded to qb online. it appears it was released about a year too soon. nothing but frustration from day one. the ipad and iphone is useless.
useful but slow. quickbooks online in general is useful for sending out invoices and estimates on the go, going through expenses, etc... however the platform can be fairly slow and sometimes glitchy.
great app but missing some things. i think this is a great start to the quickbooks app! it is clean looking and well organized. you are able to enter in or download transactions, refer to client information and many other things. my only complaint is that you cannot reconcile any accounts in the app. i would love to be able to reconcile. it would get 5 stars from me if the app could do that.
not work in india.. i have installed it, but when i open it. it show that it is not work in india. i have hear abt this app, that it is very good in it field but what if it not work in my country.
. very useful
quickbooks renew account??. renewed my subscription for a year and i'm still locked out, every time i log in it keeps telling me to subscribe for 1 month i tried to go that way and it asked if i wanted to change my current year subscription? makes no sense.. wish some (tech support or program owner) fixes it i'm about to cancel it all..... wy small business owner
don't work. don't start. when when it does it don't show all of invoices that are enter
excellent app for small business. been using this app for 2 years and we have no complaints. most efficient app for operating a small business. a+
errors. why you never check your app before you launch it online so many errors no touch id when signing no latest activities update receive payment not working and this just 5 min of use
great app. i don't understand what some people are complaining about it. this app works great. thank you
useless software. quickbooks is slow, has errors and the support is probably the worst i have ever had to use. we had an issue where we could not roster our staff for over a week due to a quickbooks error and every interaction with their support team has been horrible. the api to payroll is slow and buggy and they keep upping the prices. use another service!
. not nearly as useful as the desktop version very weak app. still needs tons of improvement
. has made my life much much easier please include income list
quickbooks. does everything i need it to do
. why can't i accept payments in the app anymore?
wonderful app.. wonderful app. makes my life so much easier. wish i would have signed up with qbo earlier.
. makes my invoice and reconciling so much easier.
awesome. i love how simple it is to create an invoice on the go. this app is definitely essential for any small business owner.
. this app is rubbish. it doesn't do the single thing you'd think was necessary using phone camera to take photo of receipt to attach to transaction.
crashes. would give it 0 stars if possible. crashes immediately after opening page information is submitted. don't waste your time
it's a good app. very convenient. the mobile app isn't perfect, and as some have pointed out a few features are missing in the mobile app. but qb is convenient. i can take payments, check accounts, and do basic things while i'm out and about. it's good, and quickbooks online support has been great lately.
. great app, very useful
good app, but could be better. the app is good but could be better with more functionality. for example not being able to add 'bills' but you can add 'expenses' a small change but would make the app much better.
. great app
changed our business. from the first version of this app with the online version of quickbooks, this has changed our business. no more scribbled notes on sticky paper or back of a student roster. sales are done immediately and nothing is lost or forgotten. my only request is to please add time tracking fit our instructors into the app, then it would be perfect!
. dashboard does not load. completely useless at this point. cannot invoice, add expenses or write sales receipts.
. great app
business owner must have. great app to work on the go. create, modify and email invoices. keep track of anything financial on your handheld device. fully automated office on the go for the busy self employed entrepreneur.
doesn’t work with ios13. just updated ios 13 app doesn’t load. even after deleting and readding.
. the quickbooks app has been a life saver! very easy to use and helps when i need to do estimates or invoices on the go.
superb. quite simply the best accounting app i’ve used. it saves so much time!
doesn't work for ipad. this app doesn't even load my company info. it keeps returning error trying to load company info. i have contacted quickbooks a number of times and all they say is they are working on the issue and to use a web browser version in the mean time. i have seen about 4 updates released and not one of them has fixed this issue. when will this be fixed?
. would love to know how this app works but as soon as i open it... it crashes. if you guys fix it ill adjust my review. but until then. you suck
good but app missing functionality. the app does not compare to the desktop version. the app does not show menu item for employees. i am using android and have reinstalled as advised by qb support but it makes no difference.
love this!. they just ended the ability to enter expenses on the road! now it's even better than before. :) the only other feature that would be good would be the ability to enter time on a job or with a client.
great product. we are a small operation just starting out and quickbook has been perfect for us. does what's on the box and a whole lot more! the connectivity with the bank is terrific.
couldn’t get past sign up!. i downloaded the app and started the “freetrial” setup. it asked for my business name, then my countryregion. when i tapped to enter countryregion, it gave no options. it was blank and did not bring up keyboard for manual entry. so i can’t even use it.
excellent app. i used to use invoice2go and since moving to quick books online it makes everything so much easier i can sync to my bank accounts and this itself is saving me time reconciling is a breeze now.
superb accounting app. the only mobile app i recommend if you are into real estate. it makes my job as a small real estate owner easier and smarter. thanks quickbooks for this amazing app. great job on maintaining it. cheers! 👍🥂
super app. very satisfy with demo. app looks and works super but expensive! :(
. i have had this app on my phone for years. i tried opening it and i was told to update the app. so i did. now it will not open. it just keeps telling me to update. i have uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it still does not work. my business is important and this makes me very mad
where the banking. i want to accept transactions while i sit in bed, this app is far from useful without that capability, come on intuit, make the app complete. as is, a total let down!
unusable in ios 13. after login, app crashes every time. i tried deleting and reinstalling as well. ios 13.0. please fix asap.
useful. very useful app create, edit, print and receive payments all in the go perfect for a business that move around
limited and buggy. there are too many features not included to make the app any use.
retired. this new online version is the best so far. user friendly, everything you want to know is right in front of you when you sign in. easy to navigate
perfect software for the right companies. i absolutely love it! i have a small freelance design company, so i'm billing for services and commissions. there is nothing i need that it doesn't do and do well. i don't need inventory, estimates or payroll, so this program is about as friendly to me as it could possibly be.
highest return on investment expense i declared as an llc. i honestly believe that quickbooks has help me get to where i am today! i am proactive and proud!
useless app. used to a quickbooks user a couple of years ago, and it was ok then, but now i have recently returned and find it rubbish. a simple thing like adding a company address is turning out to be an impossible task. total waste of my time. it you are a small business using the app via iphone or ipad forget it. stay away
has its benefits.. very nice to write an invoice on the go. but need more invoice templates for the app version. online you can switch templates, need to be the same in the app. effective once you learn the app. not perfect by any means.
great app!. one of the best apps i have used!
intuitive. qb does a great job with the app. easy to understand if you use qb online.
does what it says on the wrapper. always wanted a mobile application and this has been worth the wait!
great app. fantastic app. does everything i need to run my business on the go.
. i am totally dissatisfied with qb small business app and quickbooks in general. i'm also using an android and having the same syncing problem. i will be cancelling my subscription with quickbooks altogether and will be going with one of their competitors. it has been a waste of my time with all the phone calls with their technical support in the philippines who gave totally incorrect information about the issue which was clarified when i spoke to customer service in sydney.
. great tool for small business, it can be pricey if you add too many apps to it but in all is great
simple and easy. great for keeping tabs on your business on the go
. don't fill up your information for free trial it's easy to set up for free trial. they doesn't have options in app for unsubscribe your free trial. you have to reach them every day for unsubscribe your free trial. if you not satisfied from app then start call them before 5days, they will not answer your call till your free trial not get expired. be careful before you sign up.
. app crashes every time i try to go into banking section. have kept giving it a go over last 12 months as desktoponline versions are brilliant but mobile version still crashes
quickbooks app. great, convenience of creating, editing and sending invoices and adding customers, payments or expenses
qb online. quickbooks online is awesome and easy to use, having customer information on your mobile phone help save time money and keeps you aware of who has paid and who hasn’t paid anywhere you go, it’s very easy to print invoices to a wifi printer.
wow!. such an easy app to use as a new business owner and entrepreneur this really helps keep track of tax purposes and client sales!
. easy and quick to use for estimates, invoices , receipts and keep track of expenses and income
. this has to be the worst app going zero customer support constantly lied too been trying for 3 weeks to send an invoice and they don't care as long as you keep paying absolute rip off...not far from being a scam spoke to managers about problems and still nothing done do don't waste your time or money...try any other program or stick to pen and paper far better and less stressful
"works well for me and my needs. i am not a ""power user"" i don't run a multibillion dollar business. this program does more than i can hope to need or use. it is clean and clearly laid out. it does all that i need, and am likely to need, for the foreseeable future. i am very happy with this product."
. this is the best and easiest ap to use if your a small business like mine. i can easily create and get paid for invoices on the jobs and not wait till i get to the office. love it!!
great app. love the app. been using for years and have never had an issue
please fix!!. i have used this app for the last few years for my business and have loved it. this latest update has made the app virtually unusable. it won't let me save an invoice, doesn't show payments made, makes me sign in every time even though i have a pin and the list goes on. very disappointed and hoping this is fixed soon.
need more. please update so we can have access to more info. products and services, reports, etc.
what a joke!. quick books “backing you” is their slogan, should be backing themselves. only want your data and money. the so called “free trial is another scam.
crashes. the app just crashes as soon as it starts to load. don't waste your time downloading it.
. good app i enjoy this app but i do wish that it had the employee section. you can not clock hours for an employee.
. does it need an internet connection?
does not work well at all very frustrating. frustrating
app ruined. come on!!!!! the app is totally unusable now. can't save invoices, can't email them to the right person and can't create them with the correct info. this is the type of screw up that someone should be fired over.
complement to quickbooks online. this app is a complement to quickbooks online. this apple really work good for making estimates sending invoices and much more. i wish gopayment and quickbooks online were integrated or as one. other than that, great app.
mileage tracker. any chance you can put a mileage tracker on this app? other wise it's perfect for small business
app. using this app is like being your own accountant. it helps keep track of your income and expenses. i highly recommend to all self employed people.
. great app making it easier to track all of my business finances. and the fact that i can connect it to my other business apps saves me so much time.
. best app ever i used
great but could make better. it’s a great product but i would like to be able to view and print my quickbooks invoice through the app. not sure why i can’t do this ?
update ruined a great small business tool. quickbooks use to be an awesome tool to let us send invoices after a job is completed on the spot. it also allowed a user to edit payment information anywhere via the mobile app. this is now all gone thanks to the new update. if it is not fixed soon, we are looking into transferring our accounts to another system.
. all of my accounting is done through this app from quotes to invoicing. i also use this app for payments from clients with credit card.
. why can't i see bank account details in the app? you can on the ios app contacted help desk who couldn't help! without access to accounts the app is effectively useless.
. very useful
lots of steps. i like the app but there are lots of steps and it takes me a while. occasionally the transaction doesn't go through. it does update my quickbooks so i like that and it saves my bookkeeper time
gets the job done!. i can make transaction entries on the move. i really enjoy this app.
so easy to use. quickbooks is simple to understand and has everything a business needs with easy access from any device. i love how simple it is to use and also can rest knowing there is help on the phone 'talking to someone in australia' if and when it's needed. it covers everything a business needs to run successfully. i wouldn't use anything else for my small business
. good app
. didn't login in for a couple weeks, and they removed all of my account data. worthless.
o melhor!. excelente!!! minha ferramenta de gestão financeira.
quickbooks made simple. though i'm still not totally familiar with qb in general the app definitely makes it much easier and convenient to use and track accounts activity etc.
great app so far. great app. one thing needed i’d making it easier to change customers info when doing a new invoice for a previous customer but at a new address.
frank. this app is amazing. it is exactly what i needed to start my business. it makes it quick and easy to do your estimates, invoices, and keep track of all your accounting needs.
owner. useful for small business. able to use mobile app and coordinate with online.
crashes constantly. i hate the mobile app so much. i will be talking with a customer and try to pull up their account and then it will freeze and crash. the worst.
missing function. we need a mileage tracking function in this app, not only to selfemployed version, to integrate all the expenses within quickbooks.
nearly perfect. except for the fact that the previous version i used just needed me to upload a photo  take a photo & the system crunches out the info for me on the receipt. now i literally have to input the details. :( please restore this feature for this version too...
. love how easy it is to stay in track. easy to use and send invoices to my clients.
solid app. works great and made billing so much faster.
. this app loads so unbelievably slowly and hangs all the time. it also has different data from the web version in the p&l reports along with not being able to categorize expenses into some chart of accounts however works fine in the web page version.
worthless on ios13. out of all the apps i have, this is the only one that wasn’t ready for ios13. it was worthless during the entire public beta process & i was hoping with the actual ios 13 release, it would be updated. not the case, still worthless. doesn’t work on my iphone or ipad. it was the convenience of having quickbooks on the go that sold me in the first place. not the case anymore.
. great app
. worst app ever. unsubscribed after week as the app wasn't what i needed. charged anyway after unsubscribe. tried to reach customer service by chat, the chat keeps disappearing until the moment that doesn't work at all. horrible
ran into unsupported transactions within 1 minute.. the app is difficult to navigate, bloated and slow, using a ton of wireless data. the app would be much better as multiple singlefunction apps. i mean, do i really need to log in to qb to snap a pic of a receipt and submit it for later? typical quickbooks bad experience. very disappointing.
keep having to uninreinstall. i keep having to uninstall app then reinstall because it gives me a black screen, then closes out. this is the 2nd time i’ve had to do this and it appears it may be a bug of sorts. overall happy with the app but please fix this glitch.
newest update doesn’t load dashboard. dashboard and home button do nothing now. iphone 11 pro max. blank screen.
sloooooooowwwww!!! iphone 6. very slow to do simple things like log an expense. camera feature is useless with crop feature. can i have the option to turn this off? just wanna take a photo without auto crop which 90% does a bad job. other than that its great :)
stuck in data download. can't open app on ipad or iphone. stuck in a data download loop. support says there are no known issues, what a joke.
. can not login. spins for 20 minutes till i force close it.
. i don't usually write reviews, i always dread using the app. i have a lot of receipt that i need to add to expenses. it's a big effort to find the right transaction and add the receipt. it's painful to juggle between banking transaction and expenses. if usability of the app doesn't improve it's enough for me to pay extra and move to xero.
. one day it did not load. otherwise. great mobile app.
. this app is missing some very important things like deposits and time entry.
. does what i need when i don't have computer access.
intuitive and very useful!. i'm surprised at how easy this app is to use and how much functionality it has. i'm able to do pretty much all of my typical day to day tasks within this app. it's extremely useful to be able to quickly put together an estimate for a client from my phone or categorize a transaction. intuit, you've done a great job here!
. quickbooks is the only company that charges 3.40% for manual transactions when swipe or manual transactions go through the same process. decedent company just takes a lot of money from us small guys
. qbo is great... however, the app sucks! the info on the home page is rarely if ever correct. paid invoices show as still do, p&l info is incorrect compared to what it shows on the website. now i can't edit downloaded transaction to add an image of my receipts. plus, it's no longer showing all of my accounts when i go to categorize a transaction. what the heck happened?!
. this app is extremely easy to use and keeps all of my business accounting running smoothly and quickly. i haven't had any problems and neither have any of my customers.
scam!. this app won’t let you unsubscribe. forgot my password and tried all ways to access my account, but they won’t send me a verification code in my phone. i have exhausted all efforts to change my password and log in, but to no success. i reached out to their failure of a customer service representative, didn’t help either! scam!
simply amazing for the newbie!!. as a sole trader, i am so impressed at how simple this product is to use!! it has saved my bacon on a number of occasions!! collating reports at an instant!! not to mention looking professional to my clients every time i send an invoice !! highly recommend this to anyone wanting to commence on the journey of being your own boss!! what a game changer indeed!
unable to signin. since the update, qb won't authenticate on iphone 5s: either it states technical difficulties or the login info is incorrect. i'll uninstall and install to see if that resolves this new programming error.
bad customer services to cancel. struggling to get the right information on how to cancel before getting charged as i'm using other software now. been contacted twice with the wrong info.
". terrible customer service, took my money for a monthly subscription, then did not activate my subscription and now after 3 days of 10 pm3 am ""customer service"" messages, resulting in absolutely nothing, richie more or less told me i'm screwed and intuit, inc is keeping my money and that i can try to get a refund from google for my intuit subscription. poor business. if anyone wants to actually see what richie says, message me and i'll forward conversations."
great program!. super convenient and easy to use.
on job usage. so easy to access invoices and job costing on the job site so easy to make my life easier
excellent. great software
used for many years but. intuit is increasing the price of quickbooks by 25% the next billing period. the app doesn’t support key functions that you can access online, for example adding multiple email addresses to one invoice.
. great app, similar to desktop version.
great. great app
great app. good app. better if it had tracking of vehicle km like the self employed version
. disappointed!!!! what i need is the ability to download and accept new banking transactions, while on the go. having that ability would allow me to spend only a few minutes everyday updating my books, versus having to sit down at a computer to do this. please add this functionality to the android version of qbo. i can do it on the mint app, but not qbo for android : (
doesn’t support enough features in app. can’t generate invoice with cis. not sure i will subscribe after trial.
. such an amazing app for storing all your business expenses.it's very convenient and easy to use.those who have difficulty in managing their business transactions should definitely go for this app.
. good app
. generally a good piece of software... but, if you happen to get an unusual glitch don't expect much help. two of our invoices have been resent to a client 3040 times per day for the last four months. my customer is upset and my bookkeeper has wasted days of time on hold or explaining the exact same situation to countless tech support. come on @intuitbrad is this the best your team can do?
. good software
. good app
mobile glitches... love using quickbooks but i run my business out of town where we are not able to have wifi other than mobile hotspot. using the quickbooks mobile has been convenient but also a p.i.t.a... glitches, closes on its own, logs me out, and sometimes doesn’t save invoicesestimates. has been like this for a while and haven’t had any changes..
it's a good app. very convenient. the mobile app isn't perfect, and as some have pointed out a few features are missing in the mobile app. but qb is convenient. i can take payments, check accounts, and do basic things while i'm out and about. it's good, and quickbooks online support has been great lately.
awesome app. this is a brilliant app. i have all my invoices and expenses at my fingertips. very easy to use and synchs perfectly with qbo on my mac. keeps me on track with daily reminders of overdue invoices. no one gets away with not paying me now.
owner. great app to take of of business anywhere i'm at!
engineering team won’t fixed the azlo banking glitch.. i’ve been trying to connect my azlo bank account to quickbooks for months. i’ve been on the phone and computer with tech support multiple times and every time i’m told it is being worked out. how long could it possibly take? you all need to pay some attention to this matter please.
zero stars new version is junk. i used this app several times a day. i run my business on this app. since april 10th i cannot access my data. my business is suffering and intuit cannot fix it. i still have to pay. tech support at intuit  quickbooks recommended i switch to a android. (i doesn't work on my iphone or ipad) i really do not want to invest in new hardware. stay away from intuit they do not care and offer no solutions.
user friendly. this app is so nice when i am out and about getting good items for our business i can input them right then and there. i don't have to come home a do it, sometimes i forget then i get unorganized and have missing receipts that i later find. i love this app.
. great app helps out a lot
. awful customer service
best app. i am using this app for my business. it is so easy and accurate. i really like it.
. just to clarify, if you are based in the eu and therefore required to comply with gdpr, you need to know that your data is stored in the usa. the software if very good, but this is a huge security issue that they refuse to answer clearly
. this app has zero functionality
. if i invoice a client and they mail check or hand me a check or give me cash i cannot record income unless they pay online bank transfer or credit card. so i cannot accurately. so this app is useless. and horrible client management. also need to be online no offline input. also i cannot merge to qb app each charge 9.99 month. cannot merge date as qb has better customer tracking. also neefs time tracking for jobs
. does exactly what i need on the go.
best app for small business. excellent
easy to edit invoice. was happy to be able to edit an invoice on the fly without the need to be in the office to log onto the computer to do so!
mobile glitches... love using quickbooks but i run my business out of town where we are not able to have wifi other than mobile hotspot. using the quickbooks mobile has been convenient but also a p.i.t.a... glitches, closes on its own, logs me out, and sometimes doesn’t save invoicesestimates. has been like this for a while and haven’t had any changes..
. garbage. doesn't even have a spot to track vehicle expenses. in the self employed version you can. but you can't track hst. would be nice to have one option for everything.
bad update. this update is very bad. activities don't come up anymore. have to navigate to long to find stuff... i don't need to see company details first. i need to see customer activities.... this is such a waste of time and very frustrating. now i have to search for a new program.
. being mainly a cis contractor it won't let me make invoices in app so have to use browser which doesn't work so have to wait till i get home to invoice from laptop. any chance of this being resolved. please note i have tried multiple phones and it is near impossible on mobile browser. trying to keep keyboard up is a nightmare.
. super powerful and great on the go. there is a learning curve as with anything this powerful but quickbooks makes it easy to learn and has the best customer service
great app, slow to make revisions. app works good 98% of the time, there are some things that i would change and they do not seem to be changing them
. app is not working after the recent update, i am not able to login. it's simply goes blank after tapping the qb icon
app. best app
. not sure why i pay $16 a month for this app when it only works 60% of the time. please get the bugs worked out or i will have find another company to run my business with. cant access my account on tablet, cant save invoice or estimate on s8. please fix.
can't do banking on ap. has anyone else got the problem of adding transactions on their ap?! i can do it on a web browser but the whole reason of an ap is so you can do it from there! i've been in talks with the company for 1 month and still not fixed!
great, but need voice data entry. especially when mobile device use ... talking to fill in fields would be so awesome ... maybe integrate dragon ... hey ... buy nuaunce to own it all ... the road to intuit world domination! oh, and yes, i am available to negotiate the deal!!!
fantastic app for a superb product!!. i've been using quickbooks since i began my private voice and piano studio. i am able to easily track invoices and payments and send reminders to my students and their parents. the app has helped me save time when adding payments so i can focus my time on my students. i also love how i can send receipts and reminder invoices even when i am on the run! definitely a 5 star product & app!
. nice app for modern business
pretty lame. seriously? the thing crashes a lot , but i can deal with that. the real problem for me is the lack of calendar in the invoice line item. i would love to use this, but if i can't put the date that i provided a service in my invoice, the it is useless to me. too bad safari doesn't work either, or i would just use that.
. never works. every time i log in there is always some technical difficulty. makes having an app for a busy business extremely hard. l
great for small startup. just started using the app as the business grows it has been easy to track travel expenses and everything else we need to keep growing.
. i love it on my phone . but on my tablet it's slow and says non responsive a lot.
statements. can't send statements or use bundles in the app. email customer services about it and they send you a email about doing it on your desk top. been asking for 6 months to have it added to the app. just get the same response while they add useless gimmicks to the app.
not working. app will not open on iphone 6 plus
useless. this app is useless. you can't even see your check register. pathetic.
. keeps crashing when entering receipts. it's infuriating. updated review 6 months later still crashes when splitting an expense. tried deleting the cache. it's useless.
"getting there. qb online is a great service, but slightly glitchy. the app however just gives me an error message when i tap ""banking"". that's the most important feature!!!"
. quickbooks is perfect for managing your business expended and for generating invoices and receipts.
bank transactions not loaded. there are several limitations with this app. but my major issue is the inability to load bank transactions. the connected bank account goes sometimes for weeks or months without the transactions transferred to qb. other times they are uploaded every couple of days. there is no option to upload the transactions manually through the app. i called customer service but no one helped. this makes the phone app pretty much useless.
nice app..... doesn't function like the website
. this software is superb for business owners but need some customization in product and services option they should provide stock quantities in app and also purchase invoice with itemised discounts option should provided in app
a1 app. i love this app ! i'm using it all day !
easy to use. easy to use and uploading image of receipts is very useful.
. buyer beware. you can't cancel your subscription online or through the app like you would with any other subscription service. you have to call them and play phone tag for a while if you decide that this service isn't right for you.
buggy. login with my correct password but it's buggy and won't login. asked me to restart the application many times.
general manager. garbage company
. this app is now horrible, it was great up until latest update and now i am unable to run my business using this app. very frustrating when an app takes steps backwards please help????
good app. i have used this now for two years. it works well.
takes some learning. once you get the ins and outs of it the system is amazing!!!!!
"so frustrating. ""updated"" the app... telling me now that i need a new version of the app and since i already have it, not sure what i'm supposed to do. even my accountant agrees quickbooks online is too confusing. waiting for 2016 to close out my books and use a new program."
". the fingerprint authentication doesn't work. says ""error returned from client"" when i try to enable it. others mentioned screenshots don't work. i know there is a workaround, but that requires you to permit it every time you want to use it because it limits you to 15 minutes. there are no reports available on here which is most important to me."
struggle. guys i've been struggling to log in onto this app from my galaxy s6 for several weeks now, i'm considering switching to another provider. please fix this bug. ive tried for hours at a time, everytime it asks me if i am a robot, but it never logs in just hours of saying signign in. the whole point of having this app is being able to do stuff on the go and right now thats not working...
same as other free app. wave does the same and it's free... once it's finish my period i am out.
. quickbooks functions very well for someone who has no idea what they're doing. support is very helpful when needed.
no pdf attachment. 3 stars as the app only able to upload photo of the invoice, not other format. you need to understand that pdf is much small in size and more practical for mobile upload. as for photo, it is at least 3m nowadays and it took almost 1 min or 2 to finish the upload.please look into it in next upgrade
". constantly unable to use app  login, keep getting ""temporarily unavailable"" !!!"
. can't create journal entries. super slow app, super slow pace of mobile app feature rollout
. i've used qb for 8 years. this app is the better and more seamless than the pc version. love the capability to invoice customers on the job, record payments and send a receipt in seconds.
. great app! i use it all the time!
. very easy to navigate!
doesn’t sync with quickbooks online account. the app isn’t syncing with online account data. was hoping to use the app for quick entry while on the go.
still useless for me. all i want to do is add my time activity and delayed charges for my clients via my iphone. that's my necessary daily task. i don't need to look at my balance sheet every day, change my company information, or customize my default email message with my iphone.
terrible. qbo is probably the worst software i've used since the late 1990's. it is full of bugs, feature shortcomings, and poor support. we've been working with their certified professionals for months and they barely know how the online version works. i'd strongly recommend using any other accounting platform.
. works all fine and easy to use. pro tip: if anything breaks, delete your local cache and try again 😊 (thanks to the qb support)
estimate layout. i like the way the app works, i have problems when i need to include a lot of info on the estimates. when i send it it leaves the first page blank and cuts of some of the info on the second page. overall great though!
latest app update. this update is terrible basically unusable please change it back asap
. love the how its easy to use but editing and resending invoices is an issue. switching payment methods is hard but interface is nice and easy to use.
great app. this app makes it so easy for me to stay on top of my business. would recommend it to anyone that has a business and wants to know where it is financially.
so so. the app is not the greatest. i've worked with better.
. great app, handy, easy to use and covers most of the important tasks on the go
rcborkert. so far this is a good program. a bit pricey. maybe they will make a better deal at the end of the term (year)
. very efficient and in depth of a record of labor expenses and profit
nocturnalvicky394@gmail. awesome app, thanks
. i asked for a refund after getting the same app in another one of their products and no one responded. i dislike needing to write bad reviews.
asertek ventures llc loves this app.. great app, it completely changed the way my business works we are ten times as proficient now.
. i love this app. it allows me to promptly create an invoice on the spot which allows me to close the deal quickly. every small business should use this app!!
new update is awful. the newest update is so awful! i can't post things on my invoices, i can't email invoices, nothing! it acts like it is doing it, but then it freezes and tells you to refresh before making changes. i refresh, make the change again, and it gives me the same message again. awful update!
. hated it, warning, stay away. it mess up my quickbook online, duplicate everything, customer service promise to contact me, never happened. service bad. do not waste your time downloading. app version is useless, synchronization keep duplicates my receipts, and much more issues. stay away from quickbooks app. still not fix customer support ain't helping either, because is a third party app....
great. great app does everything it says it will
pretty good app. have an issue with multi tasking. app doesn't stay in the multi tasking overflow menu, so when working with my calendar, i need to manually open the app again from the app drawer. pretty frustrating. it's supposed to be a productivity app for small businesses, but its really not
awesome. it saves me so much time. great to keep up with my business accounting. mostly simple to use. some features require a bit of basic accounting knowledge.
best app for small business. i love it, it's so easy and quick to use. it's become a life saver for me.
. loved the experience.
great app. quickbooks have a fantastic app with full functionality of the browser version.
. naughty. doesn't tell you untill you've down loaded and set up it's only a free trial. now looking through it i can't find anywhere to delete to make sure i'm not charged.
handy invoicing tool when out and about. i use this app predominantly to invoice as i travel a lot in my job. it has been a bit of a game changer to be able to produce professional invoices on the go. and amazing to keep track of payments.
fix finally now i can get back to work.. this version fixed the errors from the last update. glad it working again. quickbooks has been good except the last update. this one fixed the issue. we us this app for our onsite business and it's great. several times i would send an invoice to the customer when i'm leaving their home and before i get to the next job it's already paid. update. does not work again. :(
"keep getting ""session expired"" message with every log in attempt. completely makes the app nonfunctional for on the go business. critical flaw! please fix it!! oh, and the link for support is dead... come on folks, gimme a chance here!!"
. its pathetic. downloaded it and got it all started and when i try to connect my bank it tells me i have an internet connection problem when i'm on a super awesome lte connection. reinstalled it with no change. talk about trust issues before we even get started.
. would be 5 stars if i could get my bank to integrate...pain in the butt to upload everything, every month.
great app. intuit is rewiting the eay we do accounting and genera finance for small companies, keep it ip
. great app. so convenient from my phone
great app but needs improvement. there are various things you can’t do on app .example you can’t set recurring transaction, use batch actions for reminders. for indian users , they have not launched quickbooks payment. there is no customer portal ,there should be system for sending invoice and reminder link via sms overall it is good app and all does the basic stuff but should look forward to integrate above stuff as well
works great for me!. this app is very convenient and easy to use. my business is not complex so it handles all of my needs quite nicely.
a good idea but not very useful yet. there is not access to the important online reports. there is no access to fx transactions or accounts in a foreign currency. i live overseas and bill my clients in us dollars and as such have no access to client information or us dollars sales and accounts. if the app mirrored the online program it would be great but it doesnt!!
it's about time!. quickbooks online and the cloud sync apps for iphone and ipad is nothing short of amazing...it's about time and wow they did such an amazing job with the whole experience. i love that i can make a receipt for a customer on the spot on my iohone or ipad.
. very go app for on the go
. this is a very user friendly app. i can modify and create estimatesinvoices on the fly! good work intuit!
great for contractors. on the go app that helps with contracts and invoices . i can use ipad or even phone to show my clients and get approval and signature for new contracts . just what i was looking for
. awesome app
terrible, embarrassing. after purchasing and downloading the app, it worked fine on day 1. tried to open it and show it off...it would not open. the next day, i gave it another chance. i successfully created an invoice template and then tried to edit a service. the app then froze. i will obtain a full refund and never give this another look.
pretty good. it has improved over the years but still needs work. one thing that needs improved is that once an invoice is created its harder to edit a line item without deleting it and reentering the line item. entering payments is not as easy with the app is it is with the web based version. i always use the web based version when possible.
ouch. does not have my bank listed. does me no good. been paying for 1 year now. and i see no where how to stop subscribing. cost me over $10.00 a month.
milage. like what it offers but for me to pay for it i need a way to track milage. this is the one huge advantage the desktop version has that the app doesn't seem to offer.
excellent app. make life way easy for small business
absolutely awful. first i was billed twice for it and then between the app and my laptop i can't fully edit fields or get it to sync with square. now it won't even let me cancel and delete it's terrible service. awful. awful. awful. steer clear
did you not test the latest update?. crashes on startup... please fix asap. i use this daily. this used to work great.
excellent app!. anything that can please my accountant and help me stay organised gets my vote!
categorize expense. useful. would be better if it can scan the photo and also categorize expenses.
waste of time and slow. i didn’t even get past the registration. the app was soo slow and laggy when i was trying to put my details in i gave up. couldn’t imagine the amount of time i’d waste trying to write up quotes or invoices on it. avoid!!!
ouickbooks. setting up this quickbooks app is a joke , the system does not work and customer support has an attitude that is not willing to help!
. the app isnt bad, but what is bad? quickbooks itself.. 1st part of 2017 it cost 39.95 per month then went to 50.00 by the middle of 2017.. and today i get a charge of $60.00!!! they randomly keep going up on their prices without any warning or reason!
great app. great app, need work on making all aspects of it to work on a tablet.
. very useful if you travel
. the support team helped with my expense logging issue. awesome!
. so easy to use, i have a specialty coffee roasting business, this accounting program is so easy to understand from day 1.
learning curve and then it's awesome.. takes some getting used to but i've now got it and it's actually very useful and easy to use. integration between my pc and iphone make it easy on the go and sitting at home. estimates, invoices & expenses all in one app.
slow books. can’t accept transactions in banking section. sluggish app, end up using the computer more often.
crashes all the time and there’s no way to ask for help.. this app crashes every time i update my iphone, even when i update the app. don’t even bother trying to contact qb about it, they’ll tell you to uninstall and reinstall (like you don’t know) and then that’s about the extent of their support.
not good. app and site are actually kind of bad. slow to load. not enough options. will try xero soon
"enjoying quickbooks online. easy to use interface and they are frequently updating features. my only complaint is that sometimes when searching for sent invoices it won't recognize, for example 74, when it's ""invoice 2015074"""
. so far this app is working very well for me and i have not had any problems as of yet
newest update is nothing but problems. can no longer update estimates. freezes and have to close app. also cannot see new estimates fellow employees have created. app ran perfectly prior to the update. intuit needs to launch new update asap or they are losing my business.
much better than the desk top version. i really like this app as opposed to the old desktop version. i'm sure there are updates that could make it better, but i'm satisfied with how it works for me.
offline mode. i wish i could enter transactions without an internet connection. then they would synch after the device reconnects.
. dont bother if you dont have access to pc or laptop.basic features like editing customer email is not available on mobile devices including tablets.if an invoice isnt sent because the recipient email address sends it back,you have no way of knowing that an error has occurred even when attempting to check via any web browser.caused me £1000's of cashflow headache. contacted customer support,got a nonsensical response.made it sound like the problem is an actual feature of the app and software.
. very excellent app
. everything i need. just wish they'd include mileage tracking.
amazing apps！. so amazing！
fantastic features. all the features that works under this single app. i used to work with excel spreadsheet, invoice app, expense app to complete the business on the go. now everything has being simplify into this one subscription saving me time and double entry. i am absolutely happy that i can email invoice, take pictures and enter expense using my iphone. best of all these is update into the cloud. great excellent accounting software nothing comes close after trying others accounting software.
great mobile app, but it has a mind of its own. i've found the ability to work remotely as a great plus for estimates, electronic invoices and checking customer records. i have just had issues with downloaded deposit amounts and matching for reconciliation. automatic entry into register has to go!
good functionality but slow to load. great functionality, good app but it takes too long to load. i don't need the homescreen with current activity to load each time. i just want to add an invoice.
very nice to use. great app
i need support no one available. i need support trying to do payroll but no one at qb is available. not a very good way to run this business!
ouickbooks. setting up this quickbooks app is a joke , the system does not work and customer support has an attitude that is not willing to help!
". only works half the time i use it, it's always ""experiencing technical difficulties"""
why get rid of banking section?. latest version update got rid of the banking section. now, i can't acceptexclude transactions, making the application almost totally and completely useless! too bad you can't give zero stars...
. love it..works grear....i do like it on full computer better
. was wondering why the app doesnt have the same features as the computer version
easy to use.. i love the email feature, and digital signature..works well easy to use.
great app. i'm a new business owner and i couldn't have been successful without this app!!
good app for business owners. i think the app does a good job with tracking expenses and billing. as a whole i think there may be better programs out there. do you research before signing up.
needs timesheet support. price went up 100 a year and still no timesheet support outside of desktop app
great for tracking business and personal expenses. great app
basic business. although it does have obvious business needs covered. it doesn't offer the next step in organization. without the ability to create work orders, or track services performed. it remains a minuscule part of my daily business. it really doesn't have anything that separates itself from other simple invoicing programs or applications. it's cloud based convenience remains the reason for my usage.
useless. why even bother with this app? i can enter a bill from a sub or supplier on the website or the mac app but can only enter paid expenses here? i can do everything i need to do with my business on my iphone without carrying an ipad or macbook air except use the quickbooks app to enter or actually pay bills (only able to record bills already entered as paid). please fix this (or just tell us you’re not fixing it) !!!
brilliant app. quickbooks is an amazing app. i'm an electrician with a small business, so i need something quick and easy when i'm in the field. entering expenses and creating invoices is so easy on my tablet andor phone saving me hours per week. great work...i'm very impressed!
". i laughed at one of the quickbooks employees response to the app being slow... they said their goal is to make it as convenient as the qbo app... lol lol bad comparison. online version is tragically slow, short of (what should be) obvious capabilities, even some quickbooks older versions have had for years. and, when challenged, their tech support essentially says ""we are quickbooks if you don't do it our way or using our workaround then you must be doing it wrong"""
crash. your latest update is crashing. it doesn't let me open the app. please fix immediately
. doesn't have my back in its list, so it's useless. i've cancelled my subscription. when i contacted support, they were obsessed with my subscription, rather than the actual issue.
. it's a great app but i wish it could do bank recs and have a little more of the web functionality. at least i'm able to do basic billing.
the best mobile app for business i've use!. quickbooks mobile app is the best app i've used for my small business. it has everything i need at my fingertips. thank you intuit.
excelente aplicación. muy completa, fácil de usar.
crashes on open. useful app until this update. it crashes on open, both on ipad and iphone. cannot do business this way...
excellent for businesses in the go!. quickbooks is easy to use and the app allows me to create transactions, view balances and customer information wherever i am. i also love that i can take a photo of a receipt and categorize it on the go.
wish you integrated with monzo. my life would be complete!
. simple. easy to use. reliable. 5 stars all around.
. app banking does not work on android pixel 3. crashes as its loading transactions. i called quickbooks and got the runaround, didnt take my issue seriously. stuck using computer
this app needs updated. this version won't work :(. not working reloaded app no go. :(
super simple. i love this app! so easy to take pictures and attach receipts to my transactions, send invoices, take payments, sign docs... very easy and simple...love it!

". the information syncs between the app & the quickbooks online because it's all saved in the ""cloud"". i used a more primitive system before this and wasn't sure how it would work, but i must say that i wish i'd done it years ago. i love quickbooks online. the desktop version is a bit easier to use, so i input from there and access the information whilst i'm out on my phone. it's really easy to resend invoices or quotes whilst i'm out. awesome!"
does not function. doesn't load new invoices. app is now useless.
. was working for a couple months. now i can longer link to my bank account and the app constantly freezes with either a blank screen or white screen. completely useless..
. i've been using quickbooks for about 15 years. i recently switched from the desktop version of the software to online, and that's ok. this, on the other hand, feels clunky and difficult to manage. i still use it because we're so entrenched in the quickbooks family, but based on this mobile app, i'd definitely look for alternatives of i as starting now.
great program. great program and its user friendly too.
falta uma agenda. deveria ter um relatório, ou layout, que apresente as receitas e despesas de uma determinada data.
. lacking abundantly completely unprofessional, there's about 5 options, you can't even put together an invoice that you could realistically give to a customer. i'm very very disappointed.
a great improvement over the mac desktop version. it saves me tons of time that i used to spend recording payments, expenses and running reports. client payments are easily paid via credit card by the client and automatically applied to the invoice. it has simplified my accounting.
. simple and to the point.
retired. this new online version is the best so far. user friendly, everything you want to know is right in front of you when you sign in. easy to navigate
best small business app!. awesome app! very helpful
no way to select india as a country. hello i am using iphone xs .. i downloaded ur app .. i am not able to select india as the country.. what seems to be the problem ?
. great app!
. log all your expenses whilst on the go!
underdeveloped & terrible support. the software is totally undeveloped and does not have the features of the regular desktop version. tech support is horrific, they can't help because they don't have the knowledge. intuit had no business releasing the software to the public it's not even ready for beta yet. the iphone app is worthless!
business on the run. quickbooks online with the ios app make operating a travel based business on the run simple. log invoices as you go. input estimates along the way. print and mail or email all at once at the end of the day. not to mention the helpful reports and expense management. i couldn't run my business without it.
amazing!. this app undoubtedly helps running multiple businesses on the road possible! when i finally switched my businesses from desktop to online there were a few things missing. i wrote a few complaints and spoke with their development team...few short months later...boom! additions were made! one if which is being able to switch businesses within the app. definitely much easier than logging in and out all the time.
always crashes and says critical updates are needed.. constantly crashing. new photo software sucks. can barely recognize the edge of a receipt against a black backround. have to edit every single photo.
estimates on the go. ehh
terrible app. you are unable to view and use the register, reconcile accounts and other simple everyday banking tasks. logging into your company through a mobile browser, such as the google chrome app for ipad, does give you access to some but not all tasks. isn't the purpose of online banking to be able to perform all banking from mobile devices?
. best business app
. great app for tracking expenses and payments
limited, buggy, slow... this a majorly limited version of quickbooks online. you really can't do much with it. it also crashes often and is extremely, painstakingly slow. but so is qb online for that matter.
excellent accounting app. invoicing to my customers has become very quick and payments entry are the coolest which i found. secondly the one year 70% discount is the main which attracted me. i hope this discount continues i also go ahead with this accounting software app. the negative is that i am not able to connect to my local bank in uae for reconciliation.that's all from me. thanks for giving me opportunity to write a review.
so easy. this app is user friendly and intuitive. i like being able to see the reports and add attachments to expenses. highly recommended for small businesses owners.
. it's useful, but often behind the ios app. still waiting to be able to raise po's on the app  that would be super helpful when onsite with suppliers.
. i love this app! it and all the other quickbooks apps have revolutionized my business!
tonya pitchford. app and product are useless for my particular business. very hard to deal with, fees are high
great app!. i already loved qb...the app makes my business run even more efficient and allows me to pull up customers bills on the spot or estimates where they can sign. very convenient.
plenty to be desired. there are options such as making expenses billable is not available. previously had issues with adjusting tax in the app and the support team told me to use the web based version. what's the point in having an app with features when the support team just tells you use the web version.
horrible. not even worth commenting on!
. great app and very convienent!
. pc or macbook apps are good but i am sorry to say that this app is waste of time. very slow. page loading time is more that 1 min even with wifi having 100mb broadband speed.
very disappointed. ever since i updated it doesn't save my expenses and crashes a lot. very disappointed.
. app stopped syncing transactions, useless!
love it. very useful
so far so good. it's not fussy like sage one. just nice and simple. it's saved me time just to do my invoices worth it for that.
book keeping made easy. with constant updates this is the go to program for my business! this app assists in daily activity and allows me to be on the move.
. makes life easier!
great app. nothing like doing invoices from the phone!
different. this is so different than qbo that it renders itself useless. i cannot rely on it for any accurate information. the only feature that is good is the receipt capture.
. app great for small businesses.
happy customer. i love this app.can do my invoices everywhere on my mobile or tablet.
easy and userfriendly always available. i've only worked with quickbooks desktop version. so far i have been using this for a week it allows me to do invoices on the fly. and i can check my staff input at any time, very handy would recommend to anyone. especially small business!
app works great. easy to do quick info inserts
alcatel one touch. great app for small business.
i love quickbooks online. i love quickbooks online & my accountant does also. this app is really good for doing your expenses on but as far as invoicing i still do it on the computer. it's very handy for a small business. the fact you can enter an expense, take a picture of the receipt & go on your merry way. i'm sold.
office portability. i can post info on the fly, keeping my books up to date, even up to the minute. my clients can get estimates instantly when asking for them. my bookkeeper can see what's going on with me right now.
. quickbooks has allowed me to continue with my business by taking care of all of the administrative work for my business. thank you quickbooks
great mobile app. this app is perfect for my business. i'm out of the office majority of the day so being able to send or create estimates and invoices is very nice. quick and easy
. works very well for how i use the app within my business.
no refund and help support was clueless.. called twice no one could help me and both phone numbers proved useless. billing support was not helpful. could not even locate my ipad online subscription thru itunes. waste of time and money in my experience.
. nice app
. so easy to use and navigate
. save's me from having to carry invoices.
quality product. i've just taken over the accounts for the business with little experience and knowledge and i have found quickbooks online very easy to use. issuing invoices and running payroll is quick and simple. the support is extremely good too from professionals who know what they are doing not just anybody in a call centre reading a script.
. great app recommend it to anyone with a business
. almost 2 weeks now the app has not been working. the dashboard is just totally blank. im having to take a toptop to work and tether off my phone.
app crashes on ios 9 and ios 10. when i click on support it takes you to a web page that also does not work properly. do you have email support ?
kerry pabian. are you kidding me !!! app is crashing on my ipad since the update ! why do you always do updates right before its time to do billing ?
. lacks functionality and still cannot access by bank account to reconcile. cannot recommend this app. avoid.
missing key functions. whilst i understand this is a mobile app, even the qbo version lags behind in key functions from its desktop predecessors, all of which intuit has had ample time to upgrade to fully integrated functionality. intuit needs to put full functionality above the profit margin and put customers above dollars.
. i use qb app every day. very user freindly
. very user friendly
mgrm. great app
super time saver. this is the easiest and quickest way to do books.
kevin morton. easy. not using any other software.
great app. absolutely awesome tool for my company
“updates”. every time i go to do something the app says it has to log me out to run updates. getting sick of typing my password constantly. (literally 100% of the time i try and use the app.) pretty much just use the website these days.
. lousy app, it takes forever to just delete a picture from the app, send email to customers etc etc. so many bugs crawling in it. fix it man.
what, no zero star option?. great job with touch id and your lousy payroll app. everything this company does is garbage. tells you about the sad state of affairs in financial software if quickbooks is even an option to have to use.
finger print capable. you can now log into the app using your finger print
. makes my job so much easier
. great program
. so handy. like having an accountant in my back pocket.
excellent. you can do so much with just this app  absolute game changer. love it.
owner. quickbooks online, so far we like everything about except for the fact that it works like crap on an ipad. please come out with an update and patch work soon it's not worth it.
"issues. it was working fine on my ipad up until last week. then starting bugging. not all customer transaction appear on the mobile app. called customer service about it. they told me that they were ""working on it"". we shall see. i pay for it monthly...i asked if i still had to pay this month even though it's not working as advertised...answer was yes. not happy with that answer. i will keep you posted. bob"
awesome service & tool. worth spending time and effort to set it up once. makes accounting really simple and reports provide valuable insights.
easy to use and great features. i moved to quickbooks after trying xero, and find it at least as good for my needs and much better value. good foreign currency support, which is important for me.
very useful mobile app. i don't expect my mobile version (android) to replace my desktop version. for checking customer balances, emailing invoices, and receiving payments it's a perfectly useful app. quick and easy access to invoices, customer balances, expenses, customer info, p&l and balance sheet. i'm not running or expecting more sophisticated reports from my phone! works great for what i need!
. wish i never started using quickbooks. i can't connect to my bank anymore . got the new app logged in and they want another subscription off me. waste of time and money. no actual support apart from the automatic ok ne which is as much use as a chocolate fireguard.
efficient app. as a bookkeeper i use qbo for all of my clients as well as for my personal account. it just keeps getting better and better. accepting transactions is a breeze as is setting up invoices, paying bills, and writing estimates. one feature my clients find helpful is the receipt attachment. i would highly recommend this app for anyone who uses qbo.
. great app! use this to manage my small business finances. everything you need in one place. also accept payment directly through the app! recommend this to every business owner.
invoice won’t work with ios 13. i’m trying to put a new customer in on a invoice and the app just turns black and white screen. plz update! i run my entire business off this app
. sporadically unable to log in. app now says that the internet connection is offline which is nonsense. for a paid subscription app this has way too many issues. not good and definitely not recommended. there are better invoicing apps for less money readily available.
great!. the ipad qb app works great! as a plus the support and development people are very respectful and helpful when it comes to suggestions to make the app even better. to be able to be completely mobile for a small business means you can be more efficient and get paid faster. the only thing the app is lacking is signature capture and then it will be everything you need and there will be no need for apps like invoiceasap.
. i really like it for the most part.. would love to see the invoice number self populate when going to send out the email
no longer works with ios 13. i just updated to ios 13. the app now crashes immediately after it tries to launch my company. i tried reinstalling it but no luck. please fix this asap!
superb app. i'm an electrician and run my entire business on this app it's makes my life so easy :)
convenient. great app now i can do the books from anywhere.
. not functioning as many have stated to be having the same issue unable to view customers invoices ect on the home screen obviously a common major issue need a fixing
easy to use. i love my quickbooks app. this is the first year my taxes will be done on time because i didn't have to spend hours at desk!
. very good app
crashes often. this app goes from being usable to worthless on a whim.
love it. easy to use and reliable. customer love the fact that they can sign the estimate and invoice.
. vary user friendly, takes awhile to learn all the ins and outs but a lot better then the old ways still. great for a small business.
still needs some changes. multiple addresses for a company is still a drama as it changes all pervious invoices and quotes. plus now on the ipad version it says i can't access until subscription is paid but it is.. works on computer but can't use my ipad. annoying!!!
. terrible service. automated systems will keep hitting your bank account causing all kinds of problems. be ware giving them access to your bank info
. unable to log on anymore from one device, support seems unable to help me. also very disappointed i can't make an invoice in a no service area and have it sync up later. called and emailed support twice now and no updates or response in over a week.
. simple, fast and easy to use
useless app. hard and bad wrote app. can't use many of the functions of regular online version.
qb online. i switched to qb online because i needed the mobility so i can write invoices from my smartphone while on the go. my old desktop version was so much easier to use and navigate through than the online version. in my opinion the online version is far less professional and versatile. i guess i’m stuck here though as the desktop version doesn’t work while i’m traveling.
convenient & helpful. as a new business owner and usually overwhelmed with just running the business, the app and website make the financial and tax side of the business easy to stay current and accurate. once i got the initial tax required and payroll payments set up, it's made my life easier.
excellent. quickbooks online has created a whole new dimension to bookkeeping and accounting for small business. the ipad app is very useful for an overview of transactions
paid app. app costs 8.99 a month
. desktop site works great, mobile site is trash and i can't even log into my account through app. says i don't have an account? okkkkk. tried reinstalling but no dice. i'll stick with the desktop site thanks
adding products to invoices. very time consuming to write any invoice on the iphone. each item must be added individually unlike on the ipad app you can multiselect items in the product search.
worst app. if it doesn't work on android then why do you keep it in play store?
"bad idea. i downloaded to approve parole only to find i need a second app for that. two out of three ""recognized"" transactions are inaccurate. back to my mac for qb. ugly app guys. sorry..."
. not supported in india... so, i have uninstalled it from my phone...
bugs & functions. fair but still a lot of bugs with tablets. mis more functions like crm programs. and would nice to have more control clients groups, commissions, as well as price list, like ,distributions, whole sale, or final client...
. easy and friendly app for your business
i love this better than their computer program!!!!. i love this app better than my computer program they have, it's easier to use & easier to track your expenses & sales. i recommend this to all my friends that basically run their business out of a vehicle saves on extra work when you get home.
super app for accounting. super
. ceashes all the time, does weord stuff with data, doesnt save lots of bugs on android
very helpful. this app does everything we need to organize our finances for our cleaning business.
. its a good app.
. great app, does everything i need while out and about. makes evening paperwork easier.
very misleading. you can download the app for free and use it for free... for the thirty days 😡 then you have to pay 11.49 a month? 🤬 that
signature issues. the app crashes every time i get a signature or it doesn't save the signature. please resolve this issue
ok when it works.. this app is ok when it works but if intuit is having issues, they will never admit it and they will leave you hanging for up to a day or more without help! not worth the money.
can't match bank transactions reliably. the only reason i use this app is to match bank transactions when i have some 'down' minutes. lately, they keep getting kicked back to me, so i have to match them on my pc anyway. also, you don't have access to both memo and description, so your notes don't appear in reports if you add the transaction though a bank connection.
great app. great app for tracking all my company transactions. love that i can get a tax report for quarterly reporting.
super easy. great app and accounts program  easy to use after a small amount of training. so far i haven’t come across any of those annoying bugs you get in other accounts apps
president. i’ve used quick books on line for a couple years now and i highly recommend it to every one i e spooked to. i’m on the road a lot and sometimes travel. any were i go i have a virtual office. i don’t have to skip a beat with the mobil app or the web based qb. just need to work i’m been able to submit statements from the app.
. ripped off!!! they offer a 30 day free trial and a discounted $4.99 per month,which i paid, then after 1 month gets cancelled.
. excellent app for smes
owner. this us the easiest app to use for my business. able to bill my customers on the spot and keep track of all transactions.
won't save receipts. try to record receipts in expenses, just get error message. called the number the message had, person they don't offer support for mobile devices or their app.**** update i did as you requested the day you requested and to date have not heard back from your staff. same issue with samsung 10.1 tablet and s6 phone.
. does not open on my phone. crashed
. problems sending invoices. update to customers from ipad doesn't always work. other issues. still a good app.
. my experience with qb has been great. its fast easy to operate .
steve. as a desktop user this was a big disappointment. if you are trying to push people onto the online version it should work the same as the desktop. cost me time and money switching back to desktop version they messed up my data took me 8 hrs of manual data entry to correct.
. i've been using quickbooks for a few years. it's been great. but lately i haven't been able to access old invoices or quotes. very inconvenient for past work that we've done. now i'm having a huge issue with latest data not syncing to my device and can't even get into my account. things should be getting better not worse. i've consulted with customer service which hasn't helped either.
. very impressed with this userfriendly app!
iphone app is the worst. the iphone app doesn't work. their customer service people admitted it doesn't work. don't even try to use it  too frustrating and a big waste of time. online version and ipad versions are good but too limited for price  reports can't compare year over year
pretty good. app doesnt have enough functionality though, need to go to the website version all the time
no multi currency in app. there is no multi currency function in the ipad app making it useless for entering overseas travel expenses.
invoicing. i use quickbooks as a means to invoice customers and collect deposit for jobs. for me it's worth it. it would be great if you could get a notification that the customer has decided to pay by credit card should you need to adjust your estimate.
great app!. ah
excellent for the it service provider. as an it service provider, this app allows me to log my hours and mileage in the field. i can even email customer invoices immediately after services are performed. this is, of course, paired with quickbooks online plus, which allows you to log hours per customer. highly recommended!!
. worst app ever. unsubscribed after week as the app wasn't what i needed. charged anyway after unsubscribe. tried to reach customer service by chat, the chat keeps disappearing until the moment that doesn't work at all. horrible
thumbs up. wish it was cheaper, but i have to admit i love it and it makes my business easier to run.
excellent. quickbooks online works great for me and makes my work much easier especially with the phone app
quickbooks. works great . happy with the app
. very good app. make invoices in a snap.
super & excellent apps. very user friendly application . i would recommend this software to other people
great app. the quickbooks application allows me to quickly see my bank accounts, profit and loss statements, balance sheet, invoices etc.
. great app
. the service is phenomenal. when my wife took over the company books, she knew nothing about quick books. i gave her the number for service and they were talking all of the time. now she knows what is going on and slaps my handsfor making a bad entry!
. nice site to make invoice and estimate, if there is any option to maintain stock it will. be great
. very easy to use on a mobile. means i can invoice on the go
"brilliant!!!!. works like a dream with qb online. i can finish a job and then send the invoice from my phone (whilst sitting at home drinking a cuppa!). just include ""totals"" for estimates and sales invoices please!"
great app. i love it. great!
. overall is a very good app. the only issue that i have right now is that i can't print wallet checks on the online version.
replacing invoice2go after 7years. excellent software
ideal for small business. very user friendly and i phone friendly too
. really slow compared to desktop
. great app wish there was more flexibility with customizing the sales reciepts
. this app is now horrible, it was great up until latest update and now i am unable to run my business using this app. very frustrating when an app takes steps backwards please help????
bank transfers take too long. i am very frustrated. it has been 1 week since my clients paid their invoice and the money still is not in my bank account after 1 week. unacceptable!
. this programapp has paralyzed me from carrying out business transactions and estimations due to a failure in the app being able to sync my data for 3 days now, customer support is next to nothing when day after day they told me i will receive an email once the issue is resolved. i am losing money and this does not seem to be a priority for quickbooks.
class reporting is needed badly for the app. without class reporting this app doesn't provide a lot of use for someone with multiple locations.
there’s just 1 thing... i have been loving the way this program functions. the only thing i continually wish for is that i would be notified when a customer opens an estimate, not just the invoice.
makes business easy!. this app is perfect for the small business owner like me.
. great app would be nice if you could add a logo.
crashes. keeps crashing. can't use app at all.
brilliant app. makes running a business a lot easier.
. conforme já relatado por outros usuários, o app oferece uma promoção de r$13,99. porém ao efetuar a compra o valor é quase r$50,00... engana na propaganda então já parto do princípio que o restante pode não ser bom!
review this, quickbooks. i was using the app on my ipad, and kept getting a notice to ‘submit a review’. only choice was ‘ not now ‘ . after every transaction, after every page change, the message came up to ‘submit a review’ i pay a monthly subscription, stop bugging me. here’s your review.
. horribly unresponsive and buggy. lacks feature parity with ios.
. great app
. love that it automatically pulls transactions from my accounts and so many other features.
. not bad. there is a bug when trying to display the contents of an invoice. when that is fixed, i will give it 5 stars. update  the bug seems to be fixed.
dreadful just unusable plus desktop version same. started well. then couldn’t input expenses on the app. hard and long winded to get support. now cant enter invoices and reciepts on desktop version!! totally pointless package and when you have r pugh troubles running your own business!!!!! think i will go back to my accountant and just dump everything with him each month as the hours this is costing me plus unbelievable stress!!!!
pretty good. the app allows you to record expenses on the go as they happen. nice to be able to balance the books as you go along instead of waiting until you are back at your computer. :)
love it. customers are paying online. so much easier for my business. great app.
. as a company you are charging too much to have such a lousy application. you can't make any invoices with android phones, it keeps giving me 'error' messages even after uninstalling and installing it a couple of times.
. very handy app for invoicing on the go
. expenses do not load
latest version is a disaster. face recognition does not work at all. you have to sign in every time you open the app and often get kicked out especially when switching between companies. colossal waste of time.
buggy. app has been very buggy. for a few months i lost the ability to add expenses and not every time i click on home the app closes. using brand new iphone 7.
don't buy this, it has glitches!. i have had nothing but problems, it won't let me in account...then didn't record travel information. now it is impossible to cancel.
figuring qb. been using this version ( the only one i ever used) for over 2 years. it seem to get better and continue improving. i still feel frustrated at times about a certain feature but whenever i need support it's available.
. please provide bluetooth printer print option for receipt print
. will add fifth star when they add support for inventory tracking
. login with google sign on sends me out to my browser then asks for password creation. continuous loop back to app then back to browser. have not been able to log in once. followed directions online for help still unable to sign in. no other app does this. guess im stuck using my desktop for quickbooks. may have to look into an alternative.
. stop. signing. me. out. of. this. damn. app. especially when i go to the length of setting up an additional pattern password specifically for this application. there is no good reason to sign me out, and it constantly does so forcing me to look up my password.
new and improved. i waited a long time to change over to the online version per the advice of my accountant. it was worth the wait. it's a much better version and easier than the regular version of qb
. great app, can do pretty much everything i need to right from my phone, but is also a seamless transition to my computer.
. been using this app for almost a full year was working great, now get error and will not sync data. if it does not get fixed will be forced to move to different accounting solution update; tried your solutions and emailed the error to support multiple times no response. i created another trial account and that one retrieved data no issue. it just wont retrieve data on mobile from my actual company account.
. awful software!! support is ridiculous. 6 month of transactions went missing. now have to buy software for $80 to convert pdf to qbo files and upload manualy. what a mess. try something else, not trust worthy.
stopped working. worked great until about 1 week ago. now i can’t see income and expense charts. also can’t view and accept transactions. i’m using an iphone 7.
. updates regularly. keeps getting faster and more stable with each update. thumbs up 👍
. love it! makes my accounting software much easier. no time wasting and sent direct to the customer and most times get paid straight away. fabulous!
essential sme tackle. intuit recently upped their game quite dramatically with the reworked online interface, which is extremely slick and intuitive (no pun!)... or at least as intuitive as double entry accounting software can be for the layman... if they added the ability to set different product pricing structures for different customers and a decent cash flow projection tool, i reckon i could justifiable give it five stars.
". the app failed to associate my quickbooks online account with the app at login. ""it seems like you have an account with intuit but no quickbooks online company associated with : my@email would you like to create a company?"" additionally, when trying to troubleshoot this issue, i was given the run around through all services... from faqs, to online support, to calling directly. issue still unresolved."
i'm a fan. i use this app almost daily now. was stuck on my computer and was not will to try it. but happy i did. joe i do accounting in the go. thanks quick books
boost to my business image with my ipad!. i went from handwriting every estimate, sales receipt and invoice to bringing in new paperless technology. at the end of the day i would have to have my wife input everything in our quick books online. then file everything in our office. it's not only impressive to our clients, but it also eliminates filing and an extra step of data entry, it saves time and money and gives you a competitive edge over your competition!
app as of lately. every time  every single time  i open app, it tells me it must log out because it’s running critical updates. it worked fine until a week ago. not sure if it’s related to apple software but it’s getting old.
easy to use. should have done this sooner!
