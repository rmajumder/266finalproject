"gary. customers complain that they cannot see your company's remittance address and are confused by the presence of a ""pay now"" button which doesn't work unless your company subscribes to additional services and fees."
. i can't view estimates on this app unless i input them in manually. they will not upload. only customer information and invoices. this makes it very hard to be onpoint with my crew.
keep on improving!. hope that when using finger print to log in the crashes will subside. in addition looking forward to the mobil versions looking and acting more like the desktop. don't get me wrong... i do feel that there has been substantial progress but i'm looking forward to not having to drag my lap top.
. love how easy it is to stay in track. easy to use and send invoices to my clients.
works great. works great for my small business. not sure why there are bad reviews, qbo keeps up with my customers information, invoices, and estimates. very easy to use. now on this last update, i did have to uninstall and reinstall on my andriod phone, but within 5 minutes i was back up and running.
. how do i unsubscribe? i've been getting charged 5 bucks per month for a app that i deleted
so easy. this app is user friendly and intuitive. i like being able to see the reports and add attachments to expenses. highly recommended for small businesses owners.
. website offers single sign on (sso) with google (sign in with google), but the app expects a username and password. 1 star for overlooking your login system, rendering it completely unusable. oops?
"buggy, issues with sync. for some reason this app is constantly having connection issues for me. i get messages like ""transaction not accepted"". then i have to log into the desktop version to actually do the work. ok for a glance but not useful for productivity."
crashes. same problem: crashes. looks good though.
love this app!. i have my own business and quick books makes my life a lot easier.
good for at a glance. very basic facility, but better than nothing. estimates that are not accepted do not show up, frustrating if you are with your customer and trying to complete a deal.
buggy. try to submit feedback and can’t within the app. they removed the quantity column from invoices and their support is dismissive. this is a big company who price gouges and doesn’t really care about it’s customers.
good app. i like simple, this is efficient for my small busines, updates are making the app better. i can recomend it is supper easy to use.
. i am a employee for a small business, and we use quickbooks for all our invoices, and keep track of customers.
. for the entrepreneur on the go, this app is fantastic. i post my expenses with photos of receipts and create invoices from the car! terrific.
. haven't been able to access my books since early september, can only use desktop app, browser and mobile app gives error message. contacted support 4+, engineers are working on known problem...10 weeks and counting
good to have. this app is wonderful to have. you have everything you need while on the go.
bob. great app
i can't stand this program. logins don't work most of the time. functionality is severely limited (no expense tracking, no bill entry?! seriously). crashes regularly. horrible customer service.
clumsy, error prone, price has doubled.. not a completely trash service, but it hasn’t gotten any better despite company promises. price has doubled since i initially joined. ipad app bugged, today i tried to enter an invoice payment, no joy. tried to leave service last year and the year before. exporting info was a nightmare, and impossible on mac, effectively leaving me held hostage. cancelling service at end of year as i’d rather try a different online accounting or simply go with a desktop version.
crashes. app crashes every time i'm using a lg g5 emailed support for help 3 weeks ago no response.sent response never heard back.
missing features. works ok. i think there are a few things that need to be addressed as a whole with quickbooks online, like not being able to print sales receipts if not paid at time of creating invoice, and no way to assess finance charges and late fees. every company needs those two things in my opinion. i can't imagine why they didn't include those features.
update crashed. i have all of my quickbooks point of sale ipads that cannot open the app since the update! we have all had to resort to computers and phones to run our business! you may want to consider this before you join up with quickbooks! they are notorious for problems relating to their quickbooks online.
solid product. it's not the desktop version and you will notice features missing that you would normally find on the desktop. nevertheless, this is a great product. it allows me to invoice and communicate with customers in the field. thank you quickbooks team.
incredible. totally simplified my accounting.. i switched from sage to qbo and have not looked back. easy to setup and learn. can send invoices from my phone in seconds. i recommend it to everyone i know!!
great tool. a great app for invoicing on the fly and emailing customers invoices when they forget them or you need to look up how much they owe. no this isn't the full blown desktoponline version and i don't think that was the intent. it does what i need it to while i'm not at a computer.
gerald. tax . tax here applied is actually confusing as only sales tax is taken into account. it's as if purchases or expenses are not taxed. if you need to claim tax on purchases or expenses doesn't show anything. it's as if i do it manually or. how do i import quickbook intuit into quickbooks online. or why not merge some features in intuit to online. it's not only as you say to do invoice as you go but you can't account for your taxes.
as a cpa, i think qboa is by far the best of the big three. it's better organised then myob and xero and accepts wpns which neither xero or myob will. the fact that it's half their price makes it an absolute winner
really like it!. this app is very easy to use. i just wish that i could deposit from the app. i love being able to make the receipts on the go but i have to wait to get in front of the computer to make the deposit. other than that it's great.
. amazing app, i literally use it everyday. you need this app if you have your own business.
. this app constantly signs itself out. it takes forever to load. quickbooks online has been a mistake from the start but i'm vested. its going to be difficult to change but i'm going to find someone else. the iphone app sucks worse.
. square app is so much easier to navigate on mobile app. plus square has instant deposit. quick books i have to wait 2 buisness days at the least. horrible.
as others have said. don't get the point.. i guess the mint guys are in charge now? the guys that created a consumer finance app that didn't have the function to balance a checkbook?
. great app. very helpful for my small business.
great app. it works great
works well. this app is far better than the desk top program for mac. as a small business i have many more things i need to do than spending time learning a program. it allows easy access for my accountant and mobility for me!
quicbooks is just plain lame. absolutely ridiculous how one cannot add extra fields in invoicing. support is full of excuses claiming things will be fixed and never goes anywhere. then got message that everything from qbse would have to be migrated to their more comprehensive (read expensive) package... basically just a trap.
. brilliant app filled with bugs. trying to email invoices and get endless waiting screen. try and update contact details and it cant upload the details. sort it out or im off as im sure most others will be.
lies. says free, makes you sign up for an account saying try it free, and then says you don't have a subscription and closes. bullshit app. deleted.
. not very user friendly. can't preview invoices. can't load tax keeps giving errors. can't setup invoice layout with logo ect.... already paid in advance but can't use it.
awesome. this is a great app it's really easy to use with seamless integration with my desktop version. the response has been consistently fast when you process transactions, highly recommend !
great app. great for when you're on the go
buggy. try to submit feedback and can’t within the app. they removed the quantity column from invoices and their support is dismissive. this is a big company who price gouges and doesn’t really care about it’s customers.
. i only give 5 stars if the app gives me free food.
organization. finally found a way to do things faster and keep me organized!! with qb app i can easily go into my account and make an invoice, pay a bill, and add my deposits as soon as i do them without waiting until i'm in my office to do everything.
just as simple as we could even think !!!!!. this app according to me is best as it's not that complicated and makes my business easy, i've not used any other accounting app so i consider this very easy for any layman who is not very good in accounting. it could have had few more options like individual job closing so to get more accurate and decrease the paper work.
$12.95 a month = free ???. misleading. first month free, then 12.95 a month. my bank is free for these types of services. i'm not happy that i wasted my internet gigabytes on a download that i can't afford. unprofessional. if i could afford i wouldn't pay just because you don't explain that clearly before someone downloads. poor business
excellent. i love this app. best ever
awesome program. i am so pleased, quickbooks is so convenient, easy and fun to use with many options that other programs don't have.
great app but.... i love the app; works great for invoices and customer information on the go... however it would be nice if i could get more detailed reports and accounting information on it too... that's my only real complaint but you can still use a computer for that  miss those reports when i'm away from it though.
so far so good.. i spent about nine or 10 hours trying to get my quickbooks program converted over to my mobile phone from my desktop after speaking with someone that barely spoke any english for six or seven hours i was told to call back the following day because they could not figure out what i needed to get done when i called back the next day thank god someone that spoke english answered and i had my problem resolved in about 20 minutes.
horrible app.. when the app is down more than few times a month, it's not convenient especially when you have to hand write the invoice and than redo on qb later on , it's frustrating when this becomes an every week story.
freelance business functions like agency. this app is brilliant. i can check the status of invoices, p&l's, reference invoices, and client trends. best business app i have on my phone!
. excellent app
great app. app is great and worked well with my iphone x but just updated to iphone 11 pro mac and app will not open crashes and closes every time please fix
for what do you need my number?. are you seriously? i have to make up an account with number? for what do you need this information? why u can’t make an app without stupid registration?
customer service and functions. you can be completely locked out upon renewal of your subscription. it has locked me out of entering for the last six days. tech support has been pretty useless at fixing it. with all the other flaws the online program has, avoid with every thing you have. you get no back up, high incompatibility, and many accountants hate it. your emailed invoice has a habit of hitting the spam bin,it isn't even compatible with other intuit products. avoid avoid avoid
. awesome app. makes running my business so much easier when i am on the go!
crashes with ios 13. just a heads up. when you try to take a picture of a receipt to upload to the account, the app freezes up and you can’t continue on. restarting the app doesn’t work either.
. this website is terrible and the customer service is friendly yet not helpful!!! i want to cancel my subscription and yet told to remove the app from my tablet....wrong by removing the app it does not cancel my subscription...very unhappy!!
. missing inventory and purchase order section
ok. good app but there're better ones
. i use this for my business and can't imagine going without it. gave a 4star because i wish i had a help guide on the app for certain circumstances.
stupid app. and never works right nightmare to login
quickbooks . . . not so quick.. would like company info on the invoices to be able to email or snail mail them. would also like to be able to change some of the categories in the invoices. not very user friendly.
. this app has too many glitches
. good software
quick books online is the best solution when your on the road. i have to be out of town and need the ability to interface with my main office and keep everything updated qbo does it simply!
great system easy to use. i really like the online version better than the windows. the app is easy to use there's some issues with it though, i would ole like it better if you could use and access every thing as if you were on your computer. i don't always have time to sit down at the desk and go threw every thing.
. so far...i began adding my customers, payments, sales receipts etc, and it's working out well! pretty simple so far!
love it. huge time saver to photo and input expenses. i can't imagine my life without it.
keep logging me out. after the update the application keeps logging me out every single time please fix that, used to do it with the previous update before this last one, you guys fixed it, but with this new update is doing it again
suits me. so easy to use, perfect for my tiny business. don't need accounting skills the workflow has been designed very well and support is great.
crashes ios 9 dont download. incompatible with ios9. can't run business properly now. please fix asap.
it works for about 10 transactions.... then it freezes and incorrectly categorizes your selections. lots of fun.
. doesn't work. after logged in, i can seem to review my accounts. this would be a great app if they could fix this issue.
easy for newbie. started out with the desktop version of qb and migrated to the qbo platform. so much better for me and easy to use now. i can send a quote from my phone and then invoice once the job is complete which for a lazy guy like me keeps me on tasks done billing times quicker. highly recommended
not happy with new update. new update has made navigating to the chart of accounts very annoying. you have to access one of 3 accounts (determined by qbs) that show up on the main page and then push the back button, magically the accounts list appears. poor design, but a simple fix. i don’t mind that the menu button has moved to the bottom, just please add a “chart of accounts” link. thanks.
amazing. it is a great app. so powerful i can do my full estimate and invoice and the best feature entering in my receipts for expenses and it's so easy!
pro advisor. the training videos and exam are not opening on my ipad. apparently doesn’t work with safari. i have tried everything possible in my settings.
bs. imported a csv for earlier history than the standard import, as the instructions said to, only to find nothing in the record anywhere, again. yes, i spent a few hours, imported lots of transactions, got nothing, twice. screw these people.
not updating. my receipts and income is stuck.
mr. nice app
. doesn't let me connect a bank account
quickbooks online + app. quickbooks online is making my business accounts so easy. the bank connections feature allows you to sync online accounts straight into your account records. when new transactions are available, you can view and add them straight into your accounts, made easier by quicbooks match feature that marks transactions with previous similar transactions. support during setup period has been excellent which has made switching from another online accounting software quite an easy process. very impressive so far.
. app opens, prompts to upgrade, no upgrades available. repeat. please make sure the upgrade is 100% released to the play store *before* forcing users to upgrade.
basic functions always don't work. touch id malfunctions, syncing is very very slow.
changed my life. very helpful and easy to use. now i am my own accountant and i can keep close track on everything i do. i love this app!
great app love it !!!. makes my work so much easier
easy to use and great features. i moved to quickbooks after trying xero, and find it at least as good for my needs and much better value. good foreign currency support, which is important for me.
. use qb for all my book keeping, estimates and invoices.
great app. simplifies my paperwork, haven't noticed any bugs yet.
not so good. it keeps hanging up with an error message not connected to the internet. not very useful for business.
crashes with galaxy s7 edge android 6.0.1. i have a new samsung galaxy s7 edge running android 6.0.1. every time i try to log into the app it crashes when signing in and offers to send a report. but the send crash report button results in blue screen. have to force close. very frustrated as i am used to using the app constantly. update: customer support was able to assist with the issue once i emailed them.
phenomenal. quickbooks app on my phone combined with the online system is the best thing to happen to my new small business. i no longer feel like an accountant full time & business owner part time!
. excellent app it let's me access all the vital information that i need from anywhere i have cell service.
. good app
amazing app, but few things need to be improved.. very good app, but needs few things like the web version. if thats added then its the best app for start up businesses.
great app but not perfect yet. if they add more customization to this app like adding letterhead to purchase order and provide educational videos on every topic it would make a best app ever.
. big time saver allows me too stay in the field, no need to make a trip to the office, no problems at all, love it.
. can't login. the web version works at least.
time saver. i highly recommend this app, specially for small business. quick, easy and in combination with service m8 it's all i need.
. great software. made my life much much easier!
nice. so far it seems to work well. the online version on a laptop works better and is much easier to use but the mobile version  minus a couple inconveniences, isn't bad either.
simply doesn't work. my companies all use qb online. i access it via browser almost daily. this app routes me to an advertisement to switch to qb online, even if i use the admin credentials. i'll assume it's something with all of my accounts and not a shameless advertising plug.
. this software is extremely easy to use and worth the subscription. i started my business last october and i have no interest in switching. cheers apollo butler c.e.oowner of hornet waste management.
. i can't use this app at all because it will not sync to my bank. not the app or any of the services offered. i'm trying to cancel all of my subscriptions and services and it seems impossible to do. directions for canceling do not work. i have yet to see any cancellation choices in any drop down menus. i'm paying for services that i can not use and unable to cancel which is a scam.
great program. i love quickbooks. i run payroll and create estimates, invoices and sales receipts. i am able to link all my accounts even my square account easily and seamlessly. the customer service representatives are competent and friendly.
easy, quick & thorough!. love this online version! i've been using it for my business for over a year! we send out about 100 different invoices every month and it's great!
. i haven't been able to use this app for a really long time, all the sudden it doesn't save my login details anymore, hard to login, once i logged in and try to go next step, it logged me out and says tempary not available. super annoying!!
love it!. exactly what our company needed! easy to learn and use. have not encountered a problem yet! love quickbooks!
. not fully fledged it's great but doesn't do much nor the basic things i would want in an app.. basic reporting, easy input of invoice (picture maybe ocr), accepting account transactions.
slow to respond from time to time .. the app is sometimes slow to respond.
. love the app because i have access to my business accounting any where
very handy.. great app for when i'm away from my pc and need to sort invoice or sort my accounts.
great app. this app does great to keep up and quickly do business transactions while out on a job
great app, prepare to be spammed. i keep getting marketing emails even though i unsubscribed from all. i’m going to have to find an alternative
great app... needs some work.. there’s no way to record a sale without attaching a customer to it. also, there’s really not a place in the app to keep a ledger. if it had these 2 things, it would get 5 stars from me, but as it stands i give it 4.
very disappointing. they frequently change the interface and items move or get hidden. e.g. customers formerly in the dashboard hidden in sales. frequently i quick on a document on a list and the wrong one opens. lists open in various formats for unknown reasons. my favorite lines of invoices disappear when i switch browser tabs to get more order information. hard to believe quickbooks has such a good reputation.
great app. helpful for small busines
quickbooks. i like that everything is so easy to see and that i can reconcile for a phone app it's great!!
. great app! makes running my business so much easier
cool app. i would have given it 5 stars, but it just doesn't have the power that i'm used to with the real quickbooks, but it's ease of use and functionality is still great for a new app.
. buy the extras!
disappointing. i've been a longtime user of the desktop version of quickbooks for the past 20 years and just recently switched to quickbooks online. i was really looking forward to managing my company's expenses, print checks, and enter bills from my new ipad. i am terribly disappointed in the complete lack of features available in this app. it's actually completely useless and a waste of memory. how could intuit release such a piece of garbage such as this?
crashes. crashes instantly please fix asap
it's really nice. thanks
touch id rules. much easier to login now.
love the app but really want the company overview. would give it 5* if i could see the summary view on the app (similar to the web version). i wish it could do everything that the desktop version could do, but i know that isn't always possible.
. no expenses apple app has expenses. android does not. somebody please explain me logic of it. android ppl only care to make money? we spend nothing! yey
well thought out. very user friendly!!. very satisfied.!!👍👍
"not useful at all. disappointing that it comes with the name ""quickbooks"" yet it doesn't actually allow you to really do that much. you can't run reports, check accounts, etc."
convenient & helpful. as a new business owner and usually overwhelmed with just running the business, the app and website make the financial and tax side of the business easy to stay current and accurate. once i got the initial tax required and payroll payments set up, it's made my life easier.
. great app. however, there is room for improvement (i.e. it doesn't yet allow me to do everything i can do in a desktop.)
the website & app can not connect. i input the expenses transaction in my computer website (put all the details) and when i opened the apps on my iphone, all my transactions called (no category) what should i do? alrdy delete & reinstalled tho.
amazing. this app is amazing work flawlessly
horrible. this app is horrible. it's a complete waste of space. it has no real functionality worth talking about. it is no better than the mobile site which is also useless.
garbage. i still can't login since last updated. it's been a freaking month
. everything i need and so easy to use as a consultant. i invoice and make banking and purchase entries in real time, i no longer need to sit for long periods of time playing catch up.
quick as a wink. very handy and does the job.
love this app. efficient
sales tax calculation is wrong. when creating an invoice, the app does not honor customer's sales tax setting. it applies tax even on customers with tax turned off. please fix asap!!!!
employees. was charge $30 for three months for payroll, which i was not using. called the payroll department and they took care of me: refunded the cash into my account without question.
. great with invoices and estimates on the go. and i can see our sales dashboard wherever we go.
doesn’t sync with quickbooks online account. the app isn’t syncing with online account data. was hoping to use the app for quick entry while on the go.
can't work offline.... mobile tech service. can't work if not in a coverage area on my phone. no receipts for customers or transaction entries. sucks!
does not work in india. it is not operational in india... looking forward that it will be made available in this region soon.
be warned about quickbooks. this is not software. it’s ransomware. every two or three years they make it break and force you to upgrade. the upgrade is the same price as buying it new. the online version is just as bad. when i started using it it was $15 a month and now it’s $40 a month. be smart and don’t become a slave to intuit company.
. can't do payroll, can't edit a register, come on intuit, $600 a year and this is your app!
. app stops working constantly. mixes up info on invoice and has even added up invoice totals wrong. update getting worse and nothing is being done to fix. have asked for help and get none. i have invoices that have disappeared off the app!? to quick books stop the b.s. and supoort your app.
. the service online is terrific. the app errors anytime i try to update from my smartphone for over a month now. support is unresponsive via email.
can't get anything!. i use qb at home and this app does not bring up any information that is needed. very frustrating when on the go. please fix!!!
this app will do the trick whenever you are on the go. i have been working with quickbooks online quite sometime and i like so far . the app is very convenient and simple which is great our busy schedule. thanks debora s
great. so nice to be able to do invoices on the run. very user friendly!
great for the mobile user. some bugs but they get fixed sooner or later
new update issues. the previous update solved these issues, but this current update causes error messages with sales rep login whenever creating invoices, and also causes printing communication errors constantly.
. is a great app to have downside is it tends to not load half the time. i have uninstalled and reinstalled and it continues to have an issue with loading.
. i use the app to send and check on invoices. its a great way to do business out of the office. love it.
. this is a very good way to keep track of it expenses and orders... i don't even know if another choice in this space!
update ruined app. since the last update you cannot run credit cards on the app. it crashes immediately when you attempt to. my business uses qb on 25 devices. all crash when taking payments. this has caused a massive issue for us and clients. beware of putting too many eggs in the basket of a company that can be sloppy with the interface they sell you.
good app. it's a easy app to use.
very happy with app. the app is very good, and provides a lot of useful information that can be sent anytime, anywhere.
. this is my first year using quickbooks. so much easier to track all expenses and sales.
. you will get no help from customer service. called 3 times. not one person could help me. i get error code 132.100. they didn't even know what it is. the answer they gave me is open it in desktop mode on my phone and use it from the browser. what is the point of having the app? i really like paying for software that i can't use. i will switch to freshbooks today 42819
mr. great app. i use it all the time on my phone and tablet.it works seamlessly with qbo. invoicing, receipts, checking my account, giving it to my bookeeper all easy and on the go. i couldn't do without it now.
problems. what my bookkeeper is finding is payments being applied to the wrong invoices. it’s really messed things up. from the checks being deposited from my bank. also, for some reason my quickbooks is duplicating invoices. i will have to erase the app and download again.
. works great until about a week ago. now i can't save anything from the app it won't sync basically nothing is working right with the app. i even tried installing it on another android phone and had identical problems. don't bother trying to call customer service they say they have nothing to do with the app and that's it.
gret app. i love this app but the reason i didn't give it a 5 is because when you enter an expense with the app and write who you paid and save the expense when you go to the computer it does not show who you paid. that field is blank.
great app. intuit is rewiting the eay we do accounting and genera finance for small companies, keep it ip
complement to quickbooks online. this app is a complement to quickbooks online. this apple really work good for making estimates sending invoices and much more. i wish gopayment and quickbooks online were integrated or as one. other than that, great app.
app is great for any business. i have a small business and this application is awesome. especially if you have a mobile business. this make like so much easier for your customer to pay online. inventory management is very easy to use and update
doesn’t load (for me). app doesn’t load. tap on the icon and nothing happens. i hope no one else has this problem.
. this app really is useless. i'm having to manually input all of my banking transactions because it never feeds in the real time info as it should. the layout is counter intuitive and frustrating to use. it's like they've made the app but never done any testing or had any feedback on how they can improve it and make it user friendly. my books are an incoherent mess at the moment, this app is supposed to make things easier but it's awful.
crashes, isn't sign in. stock nexus 5x. app won't sign in, hangs, now crashes every time.
to glitchy. way to many glitches but worst of all it is supposed to be exactly the same on the deferent computers and some times the same invoices show up on one computer and not on my i pad and only sometimes on my i phone 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
recent update. crashes frequently! if editing an estimate or invoice on ipad it opens in a floating window that can slide down into the abyss and all progress is lost! very unhappy with the latest update!
not user friendly. it’s hard to fill all boxes as do on pc. not user friendly. it’s hard to fill all boxes as do on pc.
no american express support. we use american express for expenses and we cannot manage these transactions within the app. not even see them. the app tells me to view quickbooks online in a web browser to manage amex transactions. this makes this app very useless.
. wish i never started using quickbooks. i can't connect to my bank anymore . got the new app logged in and they want another subscription off me. waste of time and money. no actual support apart from the automatic ok ne which is as much use as a chocolate fireguard.
. this app is awesome!!!!!
. requires some changes. dashboard does not update data.
small business. way to complex and slow going to make a new invoice for a new customer on the fly
"bad idea. i downloaded to approve parole only to find i need a second app for that. two out of three ""recognized"" transactions are inaccurate. back to my mac for qb. ugly app guys. sorry..."
awesome. this app is great and very robust
touch id is pointless. needs work!. the new update was supposed to fix the touch id issue. you can log in via touch id. however if you kill the app or restart your phone, you need to log back in using your password. what is the point? i want to log in via touch id everytime. that's what it's there for.
not connecting. used to work. now after login it's not connecting.
. will not load dashboard. has not worked in a month. i've tried uninstalling and downloading a fresh version. nothing helps. we are a business user and this is a real inconvenience.
easy to use from mobile phone.. i can do everything electronically from mobile device.
. so easy to use! i wish i had started to use this when i set up my business! it saves me so much time and i can enter transactions from my tablet which is so convenient. i also love the way it links (safely) to my bank account and automatically brings all my transactions into quickbooks. would strongly recommend!
great app. it is what it is. it an app. it won't have all the features of a computer and you should not expect it to. does exactly what i need it to in the field.
bugs. there are alot of bugs in the app. i am about to go back to square. the app keep giving alot of errors.
. lacks customization features
. very easy to use great app
ease of use. simple and intuitive. makes it easy to review accounts on the go and create invoices onsite.
2 stars. lack feature for canadian user. improved since update. no longer have connectivity problem over 4g. current problem with receiving online payment as i am a canadian user. paid same rate as american user with less but crucial feature. your thoughts developer?
really good app. ok, at first i was reluctant to use it, but after trying it i found it really easy and simple. don't wait, use it.
app needs help. great desktop program. the app needs to be able to track mileage and time on a job. that's really my only complaint the more i use it the more i like it
nightmare update. it was bad before the update. how could it be even worse now? unending refreshing bank data (constant spinning wheel) makes it virtually useless and beyond frustrating for reviewing and matching transactions on the iphone.
nothing works for me. nothing works for me with this app. if i login using desktop, qbo is ok but when i use the app, there is no information; no clients, no invoices, nothing. the subscription says i have a free trial until 2037. phone support was unsuccessful.
mobile app. not happy. i am on the phone with support everyday. won't print on app or on chrome. they don't know what to do. this mobile is worthless to me. i don't have time for this!
doesn't sync. app doesn't sync with qb, banking features (adding expenses, vendors) also doesn't sync with online site.
. extremely useless and convenient!
why get rid of banking section?. latest version update got rid of the banking section. now, i can't acceptexclude transactions, making the application almost totally and completely useless! too bad you can't give zero stars...
very easy to use. works great but doesn't email invoices or estimates
critical update!. i was just in the middle of a really long material list and a notification came up that there were critical updates to the app. clicked on ok.... lost everything! not impressed. there was no option to ignore or update later. according to the app update description it was just minor bug fixes etc, etc.
literally crashes every time i try to enter a sale.. great for tracking expenses but useless for processing and tracking sales. very disappointed.
awesome app. i'm in sales and this app is so much easier to use than my computer. it takes me 2 minutes to fill in the info and i'm done and my costumers can be on there way. thanks quick book.
love quickbooks. we started and successfully operate a small business. quickbooks has been fantastic for us. we can see the cash flow as well as invoice, manage vendors and taxes. it has been a complete package for us and provides a professional appearance to our customers.
awesome product for small business!!. unbelievably convenient! from my imac, to my tablet, to my phone i can access, enter payment, send an estimate, or invoice, etc and it’s all connected because i have online quickbooks. hint: go they intuit directly! itunes was charging me an extra $5 a month. $19.99 a month they intuit and worth every penny!! biggest time saver + unsurpassed professionalism to my customers and speed of connectivity!!
. won't send invoices to customers, complete waste of time and money would not recommend to anybody.
. wonderful app
. great app. makes quoting and billing a breeze.
helps me so much. new business owner, this app has been so helpful. can do estimates send invoices and input expenses from any where, weather im at the store or on the go i can work
. billing the customer at the job sites
super functional..extremely helpful. quick books app is fantastic! makes using my phone for invoicing and estimates very easy! recommend to anyone..... no glitches, no hang ups..... you won't be disappointed!
. after eading all the problems and seeing 90% of the reviews being 1 star im going to save a headache on this scam app should be taken off the market or sued for false advertising and costing people thousands of dollars. all the responses from support sound like they are prewritten for the complaints. please take app off the market and quit ruing the admin side of peoples hard work to start a business.
. excellent app to get into your data on the road. i understand more functionality would be useful but being able to raise & query jobs and send out estimates & invoices 'in the wild' on my mobile phone is a real asset.
improvements need to be in desktop version too. happy to have amount remaining automatically calculated in expense entries when splitting items between multiple categories! the online desktop version used to have this feature as well but went way with a recent upgrade, add it back please
blair. app is extremely unstable. every time i need to get on it i have to force quit the app and re loggin. i have an iphone x and it runs horrible on here. hoping they fix this asap because i run my entire service company from the app
convenient but you pay for it. this app is really handy but they jack the prices up on you once you’ve gone through all the hassle of inputting your info. they know you won’t probably mess with changing programs once you’ve wasted all that time and energy. it is nice to use, however.
user friendly. works great!. great app for running a small business. easy to use for estimates, invoicing, accounts receivable, etc. can't wait to integrate it with our payroll to make billing for labor even easier. highly recommend.
"review. i have been using quickbooks since the start of my business, and have found it to be extremely useful!! i don't have one bad thing to say about quickbooks, other then for some reason, which no reason was given to me, i'm not able to set up the ""accept payment"" option it offers. if i could activate that feature i would give quickbooks 5 stars. until then they have a 4 star review from aj's tree service!!"
. love this app
bad update. keeps asking me to sign in every time. can't use touch id or pin. fix it quick! 😩
love but.... great! except would love to be able to make a deposit with the app
. great app to manage all paper work and finance.
best app ever. love quickbooks online.... easiest way to keep all my accounts and expenses in order.
. love doing invoices and estimates right on the phone
loving this app. it's able to do everything i need it to do. after searching for so long and going through so many sub par apps it was such a relief to find this one!
great fing app!!. i love this app, everything syncs over so well from the web version. it's very simple to use and makes my job a hell of a lot easier!!
. i would like to tell everyone who reads this that my small company and i were victims of a fraud through this app and they did nothing to help me and at this moment they put my company in collection !! in addition this is not a good app!!!!!! 🤬🤬🤬🤬
gets the job done!. i can make transaction entries on the move. i really enjoy this app.
. loved it, but acting up again. when i add something to an invoice (on s8) the hit done, the refreshed invoice lines are all out of order and duplicated. uninstalled and reinstalled, still doing it. please fix.
. can't upgrade... even with tech support's help they can't figure out how to make it work. after writing this review support contacted me and managed to upgrade.
. i downloaded this app and not once has it worked. it crashes when i'm trying to login. i've never made it past the login screen!
way too limited. i can’t even use the app to see if a bill was processed. it only allows you to view check or ach transactions and deposits. checks processed through bill pay don resigister as activity.
". error message that cannot be fix ""cannot add this invoice, if error continues, please contact support"" that cannot be fix from quickbooks my android app been like this close to 1 month cannot create invoices estimates so on my business suffer cause of that, have use regular computer to create what was said. not good for business all subscriptions are active."
great app. so helpful. i love the signature on smartphone for delivery confirmation. wish i could process bank statements and send customer statements on the go though.
garbage. quick books won’t upload garbage use and other accounting software.
can't do much. among other things, you can't enter billable time. this would be my main use for this app.
glaring omissions. this would be a decent app if it could do the very basics of the online version, but it can' track mileage or track hours. why?????
. app banking does not work on android pixel 3. crashes as its loading transactions. i called quickbooks and got the runaround, didnt take my issue seriously. stuck using computer
needs to improve. the more i use this the more i find things that annoy me. when reconciling the bank why can i not just add a receipt photo to a bank transaction. that way i don't have to add it as an expense then match the bank transaction. it would save me time. seriously considering giving xero a try.......
does not work after update. tech support recommended i get a android. claims apple is the problem.
. quickbooks it's been awesome for my business. i can send estimates and get all my receipts taking care at one app. i highly recommend quickbooks to anyone who has a business.
. accurate app
love it. makes it easy to keep tracking of eveything. as a business owner, operator it gets hard to sit down in front of a computer, with this i can do my invoices on the go!
my music mi musica en espanol y english bilingual. bilingual
. i wanted to subscribe this application. when i try to signup i got error i again try to signup got message this application is not available in india.
. i love the freedom that qbook gives me with the online version i can work at any place out side of the office.. also update are free and there free support team are the best. thanks so much qbook for be there for my business and me..
pretty but not functional. it's bizarre how the graphics continue to be improved but the functionality doesn't. i've been trying to use this app for years but the features i need on the go are missing such as timekeeping. mostly this app seems to work a lot like you would imagine quicken mobile to work, by being able to look up past banking transactions. but i can do that on my banking apps for free already.
. love that i can create estimates, invoices, and view my banking account activity all on the go with one app.
subscription does not work. after 1 month free trial (in which i never been interested as i was happy to pay from beginning) the app stoped working. payment is demanded, unfortunately on ipad or iphone version either it is not possible to make a paymentsubscription or the instructions are not clear enough or there is an error. to subscribe should be made as easy as possible.
bookkeeping on the go. i own a small tax and accounting firm and this app has done wonders for customer service! being able to give my clients real time information from anywhere at anytime is a huge plus!
. fantastic, easy to use software. i own two small businesses and quickbooks has made my life a lot easier. with the app i can use it anywhere, which is a nice bonus. highly recommend it!
latest update not working?. can't save payments or invoices now? kind of a critical thing for doing books on the go...
"awesome apptool. although i rate it 5 star, there's much improvement that can be made on creating ""invoices"" definitely needs more options and versatility. needs more custom ability in modifying the invoice into something fitting to each customer. overall, keep up the great work and adding new custom features."
. very good app
love it!. quite user friendly. i love it. if i had formal training i think i'd be a pro with it!
bugs and bugs it a jungle. need to be able to email multiple emails at one time.
love it, i use it everyday for my business. qbo has helped my business grow buy looking professional, keeping up with invoices, and giving easy ways for the customer to pay.
. great product easy to use and understand. not complicated at all make changes view reports and see everything clearly.
. it's been years and the login still fails 80% of the time. have to clear data in the app just to login. it's a nightmare.
. good and simple
easy for newbie. started out with the desktop version of qb and migrated to the qbo platform. so much better for me and easy to use now. i can send a quote from my phone and then invoice once the job is complete which for a lazy guy like me keeps me on tasks done billing times quicker. highly recommended
never even got it opened before it had an error. i have never had this in my life,my business barely has a name and it said an account already exists under my email address.. sounds like there are some issues to work out
jordan hugo ,. i'm young and in business , only small but this app is perfect for tracking my expenses and sending quotes off. highly recommend.
great app for busy employersemployees. your features are reduced and it's not the exact same as when you use a pc but it is still really nice. i would not be want it to be as in depth anyways it's nice and simple. i would recommend it to anybody that needs quickbooks on the go. we do a lot of work in the field and it is really nice to do estimates and email them to the customer while standing right next to them.
. chaparrita49 love this app
. this app isn't ready for primetime. used to work better. the reconciliation doesn't work if you need to hit the back button on any transaction no matter how many you approve before it. completely frustrating and gets worse with time.
. downloaded because i was told its a app that would help me. i wasn't ready to learn. today i 😍 this app!
. not all of my customers show up and neither do all of my past invoices. this makes it impossible to send out invoices unless i want to create a new customer profile every time. so, for my use, this app is effectively useless most of the time.
easy to use. makes life easy for tracking all business expenses and payments
. simple and easy to use
app keeps crashing. even when i try to leave feedback the app crashes. no issues on desktop.
great for small business. i decided to use quickbook for my small busy because i wanted something better than excel. i glad i did. this is a great way to keep a business going.
could be better. it doesnt give you an option to enter a vendors bill on the app, its not convent to aways have to log onto a computer to enter a bill. you arent even able to review outstanding vendor bills etc on the mobil app
changed my life for the (much) better!. want to send an estimate in the time that it takes your barista to make your coffee? the amount of time that i save managing my business on my phone has cut my desktime in half. i couldn't be happier!
. very useful
easy. great design, easy to use interface and great for quick overviews and adding data
limited features in the app. the app has extremely limited features as compared to web cant send customer statements or edit recurring transactions or match partially paid invoices.
very handy little app. as said in other reviews it is a little different from the computer version but it is such an easy way for me to do my invoices on the go! it's all set to go and it tracks all of my invoices and sends me reminds of unpaid one too! great little helper!
owner. love the app. makes running my business so easy. i would give it five stars except once i was using the app and the system was down for little while. made me feel a little uneasy
app, subscription. cannot updat subscription gives error on can’t upload data, now expired, very frustrating need solution
great app. nothing like doing invoices from the phone!
user friendly but. this program is extremely user friendly and makes book keeping easy for small business owners but the cost of doing payroll for employees is extremely expensive. i have 5 employees and it costs way to much for me to use quickbooks 👎
great app. i have been using quickbooks for about a year now. it's has been a major asset to my business. it made filing my taxes quick and easy too.
buggy app. doesn’t even open, tried many times opening it on my iphone x for weeks. it doesn’t even open the app and there hasn’t been an update to fix that for ages. unable to use it on my phone and having to use it on my laptop which i don’t always have it on hand. please fix this issue.
best mobile accounting app. great improvements in the latest version. easily the best ipadiphone app for accounting, that sits well alongside the full featured qbo software.
email is my only complaint i don't like my emails coming from into it i want to choose my own email so my customers can respond please fix this. respond it's when i'm sending invoices or estimates
great features but very unstable and poor support. i’m an accountant that works with xero, qb and myob. quickbooks online offers probably the best combination of xero and myob’s best features but is let down hugely by the app’s instability (very slow and regularly crashes) and their support, whilst very friendly, is poor in quality and suffers from obvious lack of proper systems and workflow. we’re holding off recommending qb to clients for these two reasons. they aren’t quite deal breakers but close.
. can't create journal entries. super slow app, super slow pace of mobile app feature rollout
crashes with ios 13. just a heads up. when you try to take a picture of a receipt to upload to the account, the app freezes up and you can’t continue on. restarting the app doesn’t work either.
app doesn’t work on ios 11. don’t waist time
meh. constantly making me sign out. constantly not updated with what’s online. constantly telling me i’ve got outstanding invoices that have long. we. recorded online.
exceptional. this is incredible intuitive software that keeps you completely up to date. it saves hours of time. this is very easy to use. highly recommend for every business owner.
. no expenses apple app has expenses. android does not. somebody please explain me logic of it. android ppl only care to make money? we spend nothing! yey
can't log in. crashes every time i try to log in. reinstalled twice. no go.
. for what i do this was a complete waste of money. . it was supposed to import all my all my spreadsheet and all that information over to my taxes when i signed up with tax turbotax or whatever it was. it doesn't nor did it. and now it keeps trying to charge me $60 for something after i cancel my subscription because all it did was make my taxes more complicated than they had to be.
. amazing app ever!!
qb app is useless. i’ve been quickbooks user for a long time and discovered this app gives a totally different set of numbers than quickbooks online does. expenses are different than real version so please beware, you can’t trust the numbers. contacted support to no avail. i guess they don’t read the other reviews either.
worth the price. i am a small business owner, i was having to write out estimates and bills but since i have this app....... life is way easier!!! now i have more time to do the work and less hassle with the paperwork.
. this program will not let me separate my inactive accounts from my active accounts. also navigation is not intuitive to me.
"about 710. not bad but not good. the app keeps requiring updates if used on apple products. not an issue but the updates never appear. quickbooks blames apple and apple blame quickbooks. we ""updated to the cloud version"" from a pcm based quickbooks. so far we are very very disappointed."
did you not test the latest update?. crashes on startup... please fix asap. i use this daily. this used to work great.
i love this quickbooks!!. it makes my life easier and helps me with my taxes. just a few clicks and a email and my tax guy has all he needs
awful software. i have quickbooks for years and the service is awful and the customer service reps can't help you. plus read the small print about the merchant account i have been paying 4% on credit card transactions. simply horrible
worth the buy!!!!. quickbooks mobile has made estimates and invoicing so much easier! definitely with the buy for any small business!
makes my life easier!. keep it up
amazing. great app and really easy to use. no need to wait to be at the office to do any transaction, all done easy and simple right on the spot!!!!!!!
. i love this app easy to track expenses.
. great for you business. i love how i can quickly add an expense by taking a photo of the receipt as well as logging payments on the go. its awesome that you have your data right there at the touch of a button.
quickbooks phone app. so easy i can’t believe it.
not impressed. started using the app because it was recommended to install it with quickbooks online. the app does not show any up to date transactions that were entered on the quickbooks desktop version, you cannot search by phone number or address only customer name in the app also. i would have thought the app would have been more useful to use while out in the field.
missing functions. great app for its current functions but it is missing functions such as entering bills while on the road. most of my purchases are on accounts so it leaves me doing my book work at home like the old systems. if this gets added i will stay a happy user if not back to one of the other competitors.
they just keep changing the app.. my biggest complaint about the app is the limited features on customer entries. the pc version you can enter a customer as tax exempt on the phone you can't. further if you open the customer information on the phone and save it it will clear the tax exempt status on the pc version as well. so it is a constant battle to keep who is and isn't exempt straight.
. grid great app need estimates though n e one know how to do that other than that great app very easy
crashes every time. when app is installed i can log in to my account. then the app says « downloading data » and when download is complete it crashes. if i open it again (so still logged in), i cant even get past the launch screen.
nice app!. i live on my device  from research to book keeping. elegant style and useful! i can do almost everything from my note 2! light years beyond the old quick books that i used 10 years ago! i'm sending invoices in minutes. awesome! update: still a great app on my nexus 6!
. since they changed the app its not working properly nothing appears on the dashboard and can't produce invoices
great app. easy to use. love the 4 digit log in option.
still useless for me. all i want to do is add my time activity and delayed charges for my clients via my iphone. that's my necessary daily task. i don't need to look at my balance sheet every day, change my company information, or customize my default email message with my iphone.
qb pro advisor loves it!. i'm a pro advisor and love this app! all my business management clients, including entertainers and producers love it as well!
. very good app
small business. this make life easier for my small business. i wish i found out about it sooner. we use it on a daily basis and love how easy it is to use
. makes my invoice and reconciling so much easier.
love this app and online version of qb 😬. i converted to the online version of qb from the desktop version and i have to say it was the best decision i made! my primary laptop crashed & nothing could not be recovered, the online version of qb was never an issue & continued seamlessly. this app is such a convenient perk to qb  i can't say enough how fabulous this app is. love it!
. it's a very powerful program for small businesses. love the variability of online to where you can use any device to accomplish tasks
good app. good app, lacking functionality but this will improve in time.
broken. the last update broke the app. various error messages. can’t safe expenses anymore. errors include asking to chose a template before saving expenses etc. bad woek
. very efficient, very useful
makes business easy!. this app is perfect for the small business owner like me.
does not work for android any more. after months of calling customer service sending id ,still no luck . app does not work with android phones,it logs in but it's nothing there because it does not want synchronise,so i have my account with no details in it ,except profit and loss. so if any wants to use the app with android phone and have a data on the web do try it .
. it collects all your information first then it tells you it's paid app.
there’s just 1 thing... i have been loving the way this program functions. the only thing i continually wish for is that i would be notified when a customer opens an estimate, not just the invoice.
. does not work in india. restarts the phone . takes too long to uninstall
qb app fail. app is very frustrating. sometimes works great but most of time wants to download company data and 15 min later still not downloaded. i try over and over and give up. then every once in awhile it works. fix or get rid of.
easy, quick & thorough!. love this online version! i've been using it for my business for over a year! we send out about 100 different invoices every month and it's great!
it gets even easier. i was horrified when i heard tax going digital but quickly got the hang of quick books and amazed it even tries to match things . brilliant
easy of use. i think the app will be great once i figure out how it works.
pdf note on ipad. why can't we add a pdf note on ipad app. i can do it by accessing desktop version on ipad. but it's a pain doing it that way. the writing in the download box. the ipad wants to copy that. instead of accessing icloud or other cloud options. it takes several trys to do it that way. it would be simpler to add that option to the app. come on guys keep up with the technology. quit lagging behind.
great for on the go use!. love using this app! great for small business use & being able to use anywhere! with multiple people using one app!!
weak iphone app, no customer service. really weak app, no customer service. after trying to contact qb customer service, i got no response from anybody at qb. after paying big monthly fees $ i'm switching back to invoice2go, where i got great customer service and my feedbacks were used in improvements.
app isn’t working now. please advise. it has stopped working. i click on the app and it automatically closes. new iphone today should work unless not compatible with ios13.
spam generator. don't get involved with intuit. they're stalkers. whatever utility the app has is outweighed by the spam
. this update is very bad. activities don't come up anymore. have to navigate to long to find stuff... i don't need to see company details first. i need to see customer activities.... this is such a waste of time and very frustrating. now i have to search for a new program. the app on a mobile device doesn't even open. it says sync problem. it's been days since i logged into the app. always problems with this company. the app is terrible.....
. please provide bluetooth printer print option for receipt print
easy to use. a very easy to use software that is cloud based with a great phone app. i’ve been using this for some time now and it evolves every year. most for the best. a helpful help call centre should you have any problems. 4 stars as i don't believe you can back this up
worst app. if it doesn't work on android then why do you keep it in play store?
. this app is great for tracking income and expenses! feels good to know how i am doing on a dailyweeklymonthlyqtrlyannual basis. keeps me competitive and on track financially.
great app. great app!
wonderful app for freelancers. likes: stores repeat client info  allows for cc payment  allows me to include my company logo and information on each invoice.  alerts me of tardy invoices  provides me with easy to read charts and measure each months incomeexpenses dislikes:  credit card payments incurs a hefty fee rather than a monthly charge  all of my invoices have an intuit logo  customer service is not great
. the app is currently not working as i cannot login for the last few days. i can login to their website so it's just the app. i have sent the error log a few times and still no fix. i have deleted the app and redownloaded still no luck.
on track. keeping track of daily expenditure, and the performance of my business is so much easier with this app.
changed the way we do business. i love this app. we needed something that we could easily use in the field. we can create estimates, invoices, receive payments and even attach check images to those payments. our productivity has skyrocketed. quickbooks has figured out the mobile accounting software. customers for life.
miss e hughes. fantastic resource easy to you & amazing customer service.
useless. i am an avid qbo for ie customer for many years, but this ipad app is useless. can't do anything with it, and can not see banking info, the most important thing in accounting! if you want to view customervendor names that can be done, but you can't work in this app. view only.
inexplicably no timesheet support in app. the most obviously missing feature is time sheet support. the support team is also quite useless and closes cases without resolving them or providing any assistance.
company owner. you can't go in an manage users unless you have a desktop version that's just not acceptable i have an ipad pro cost 3times what my computer cost it better get fixed or i am gone.very disappointed. also customer service can't help either rg
. keeps asking me to install new version, have un installed and re installed but keeps sending me back to here to install so cant open my app! not what's needed when running a business.
great app. love it. very intuitive!
. terrible experience. app would regularly crash, bank accounts would continuously disconnect for no reason. frustrating and in no way time saving in the end.
love this app. i have a small bookkeeping business. i love that i can create invoices on the fly usually in less than 5 mins. i can also send the invoice via email as soon as it's saved. very easy to use app if you have quickbooks online
documentcustomerjob searchinfo. i find quickbooks a great tool, however there are areas that could be improved firstly when i open a clients file i can see all the info apart from our reference, this means we need to search via pricedateinvoice number, it would be far easier to find a document by our job namereference
glitchy, incomplete features, and poor data. this app needs serious attention. after years of putting up with this hot mess i’m fed up and rarely use it any more. no matter what i do i can’t get data to load that is any more recent than 2016 for most vendors. no one from tech support replies  ever. american express transactions can’t be synched or approved in the app. about the only thing it’s useful for is matching typical transactions in our checking account.
great app on the go. there isn't any comparison to the quality and convenience of the quickbooks package
. is this app available for india customer?
what’s going on?. i’m paying almost $11month for an app that “can’t update payment information right now.” this has been going on for weeks. i can’t even send current invoices. pointless to have at this time.
great but wip. better than the competition and best customer service in the space! well worth it.
. good app
customer service & support sucks. go with freshbooks instead.
. nice app
scanning receipt yet to be as effective.. i was using neat desk for scanning and it captures all bills. if quick book cannimprove receipt scanning for cab and other bills it will be wonderful.
sales tax calculation is wrong. when creating an invoice, the app does not honor customer's sales tax setting. it applies tax even on customers with tax turned off. please fix asap!!!!
ipad. does not work with ipad pro screen that well
very good app. in general very good app. missing key features like banking, updates etc.
. doesnt work on my google pixel 2 or pixel pad.
. great app.
. very miss leading and is nothink like the tv advert. not to easy to use and over all disappointed. having to use it because of my accountant. no impressed!!!!
don’t waste your time. the developer is very slow to fix bugs and non responsive when a complaint or ticket is generated. the tax rates are a total mess in the app. there is very little control over adding new or editing existing rates generated by qb while using the online version. any time i use an apple product i have the same issue.
useful. i don't use it often, but when i do its a lifesaver.
. love that i can create invoices and estimates on the go. although i would like to manage payroll wirelessly.
. makes my job sooooo,much easier
crap. this app is a piece of crap my dad got it on our computer.when u scroll it goes the opposite way and there is also a bunch of other crap. i would. it recommend getting this
great but…. this app won’t get more than two stars until i can enter a single time activity from my phone.
. the app is unusable and highly inferior to the web interface. when you create an invoice, it always defaults to retail invoice without the facility to change to tax invoice, so i'm forced to use the web interface for invoicing. suppliers activity always shows a blank page so again need web interface to view suppliers balance, expenses etc. can't you people make a decent app ?
almost five star. the app is good, no crashes , only problem is that there has to be away to enter supplier bills , posted to accounts payable, not only as cash credit card payments
great app. this is getting better with each update it makes. i you this app everyday to run my practice and it makes it very convenient because i'm constantly on the road and i don't have to sit at my desk just to enter expenses or send invoices to clients.
app crashing in ios 13. please note that the app is crashes in ios 13. have not been able to open it sine updating. otherwise it is a fantastic application.
quickbooks makes it easy. quickbooks is one of the biggest reasons my company has hit tremendous growth. online invoices and payments makes my job literally a thousand times easier.
. problems sending invoices. update to customers from ipad doesn't always work. other issues. still a good app.
doesn't send invoices. my customers stopped receiving invoices from me via email. i have to send it to myself and forward to them. customer service is a joke: they think their clients are stupid, their advices are just ridiculous: are you sure you put the email in the right section? really? i had been sending invoices via email before and they all received them.
. my only complaint is if i'm writing or editing an invoice on the mobile app and want to put a discount i can't put a negative amount.
the best accounting app for sme. great product at affordable fees..i love the constant improvments that you guys make..i own a chain of smartphone retailers and it working great for me..missing the fifth star because inventory options need some improvments other than that its great..keep it up!
best accounting online software. very useful very easy and flexible
binoy. easy to use interface love the app
often worthless. when the system works it can be great. however, i’m in day 3 of not being able to get bank accounts to update.
game changer. this has been a fantastic app. having the ability to access our estimating and billing from any devise has been great !
great helpful app. i use sever times a week when on the go
. it wont let me use time activity can u please update it cause we need to use it in the ceild more than at the office
. already pay for online subscription qb pro why do u charge for the mobile companion. rip off. software is already expensive. american greed!!!!
amazing app!!!. this is the most powerful and helpful app to manage a company, it it easy and friendly!!
great app. yet again another update and even more glitches, you charge a fortune and cannot provide a decent service  i’m considering switching to a competitor as you have breached the contract that you have with me. this needs fixing urgently and you need to refund subscription fees! my advice to businesses and the selfemployed is do not use quickbooks!
great for small business. i am a partner in a small mobile based business and the financial dealings are my responsibility. quick books online along with the app make everything so much easier than what we were previously using. using the app is pretty intuitive and you can accomplish anything i need to at a job site.
touchid times out. unfortunately the touchid authentication doesn't work as you'd expect. the app constantly asks for you to enter a password even with it enabled.
. great app... easy to use
. it doesn't load new transactions to review ever, even if you're days behind. kinda pointless unless you're trying to just use it for previous reports.
stopping subscription. originally a useful app, but keeps crashing following the most recent update on 27.09. will have to stop subscription and find something that works, so whats the point in updating the app if you lose customers?
awesome. i have an hvac business and everything in this app is awesome. the invoicing,estimates,collecting payments, emailing invoices or estimates, the whole thing. my wife does the books and she loves this version of quickbooks better than the pro version. i can access it from my ipad or iphone and my wife can access it from her samsung phone. all around great app. you do have to have the quickbooks online version on a computer and it has a monthly fee, but well worth it.
. was working ok then app was updated,. help centre can't give time to fix or troubleshoot to be able to use this whilst out on jobsites not happy at all costing money
good app. like the easy use of the app
super & excellent apps. very user friendly application . i would recommend this software to other people
great! but it could be a tad bit better. the app is great and works perfectly fine. just needs to somewhat mirror the desktop view. only use it when i have to or can't get to a computer and all the visuals from desktop view are what catch me. easy to ready everything, maneuver around and get to what i want. app is half that, but other than that, i like it
. app runs extremely slowly and often won't even open. it freezes almost constantly. using a galaxy s8 phone.
crashed when entered a sales transaction. downloaded this app to see if i could use it instead of at a computer and the app crashed as soon as i tried to enter a sales transaction. i tried to enter in the receipt type and it crashed
. easy to use, great for keeping track of expenses, account payable, billing invoices, service. link to your bank account to keep track of everything all in one place
android app. android app on phone lately does not open...
it's not like the desktop version. why doesn't this have the same functionality as the desktop version? what a joke it is. i am so ready to switch to anything else!
. almost 2 weeks now the app has not been working. the dashboard is just totally blank. im having to take a toptop to work and tether off my phone.
. app doesn't have all features, as we have it in web application.
. the app is very restricted, kind of defeats the object when many of the online functions aren't available
east coaster. i love the online version. i can use my laptop, ipad or iphone to update, send quotes or invoices and even take payments via email.
great app. the app does everything i need on the run. thanks
. easy to set up and easy to use i reccommend talking to an accountant if your setting up a small business
. great app, love that i don't have to write a note to bill someone or change something later. i can do it right after i hang up or deliver an order. still learning all the options. it's not always as straightforward as i'd like, but a couple clicks and i can figure my way around to where i want to go.
. mobile app needs some more work
not so great. appears so different on mobile then desktop. allot of functions not available in the app. can’t really use it on the go. for example cannot fill the site details on app as it dose not appear.
not easy to use. simple tasks like entering a transaction are complex. app and online qb have a slow response when tapping things. just overall frustrating trying to switch from desktop qb to the app and online qb.
. mostly worthless can't see bank balances or registers.
easy to use. this app has been a life saver for starting a business and trying to keep the records straight. makes it easy for my accountant to access my records. good job quickbooks
. as someone starting a small business, i needed a quick and effective way to keep track of receipts, other costs, mileage, as well as sales and track a percentage of my profits that goes to a charity. i love having this easy to use app on my phone so i can input info on the go! highly recommend for the small independent business owner.
. it's ok when it works, but it takes forever to do anything. it's extremely slow. now it's stuck so it crashes everytime i log in so it can't be used at all. edit: reinstalling the app seems to fix the crash bug.
getting better but a long way left to go. we switched to quickbooks on the recommendation of a number of accountants. then we realized that quickbooks online and the desktop offering are worlds apart. the app is good, but not great. the entire qbo experience is frustrating and getting support is difficult.
wonderful app!!!. couldn't sing the praises high enough. i run a small, single member managed llc and the quickbooks online app is everything i need. i can create and send invoices and sales receipts on the go, even have the customer sign right on my iphone or ipad.
capturing expenses? approving transactions?. really nothing no support for the consultant on the go? why can't i shoot a picture of a receipt put a dollar value a catagory and a note and have it either for review or added to my expenses. what about my transaction list i can't see the same information from the full website here at all. throw us a bone man....
. so slow to picture receipts and save as a note!!! just scanning 6 invoices took about 20 minutes. nightmare.
. does the trick. is easy to use and does not cost and arm and a leg. i'd reccomend.
. how do you update the bank feed manually? there's no refresh button and pulling down from the top doesn't work? super laggy after the latest update...re intuit, nope, no refresh pull down or button next to the + also, still crazy slow and choppy
couldn't live without it. love this app. makes my life as an accountant easy! now that we have shifted our business to a more mobile one!
can’t subscribe after trial period. it’s a good quickbooks version but i started trial period made a profile and invoices but the app won’t let me renew subscription the buy now button doesn’t work when clicked on. now i may have to start another profile and lose everything?
really convenient. love this app. i'm trying it as a trial and i'm sold. we will be getting the monthly service for sure.
lame and useless. don’t waste your time punching in a bunch of data only to have limited access to reports and editing. total bs.
so very useful!. i run a dog walking business and basically manage my entire business with my s4, this app and a printer. so easy to set up and maintain. i am very happy with quickbooks and would definitely recommend to others.
great cloud based platform with all the features i need.. qb online is a phenomenal cloud based accounting platform (when using apple products). quick easy invoicing, banking, payroll, and report generation for the business owner on the go. seamless integration from mobile device to desktop with realtime updates and editing across all users. this platform slow me to run my $1.5 mil small business from my bed, boat, camper...virtually anywhere i have cellular signal. it allows me to be as mobile as i wish.
great as an assistant to the desktop version.. i've found this app to be a great mobile partner to the full desktop (or online) version. there's a couple functions that aren't available in the app but everything you do need is easily available. i can't connect my bank account because my (non us) bank isn't listed but being able to input expenses as they happen is a great way of keeping updated accounts. reconciliation is a breeze afterwards. it's a great app.
love it!. took me a while to get confident using it as i was used to doing things manually but now i love it. and especially love the app. don't know how i managed before!
easy. easy to use, and has all the features i need to run my lawn care business. i recommend it to everyone. my only issue was getting my subscription paid for. i worked it out by calling customer service and they were awesome.
. excellent app
. this is a easy to use app and makes keeping track of finances easy i'm still having no problems using quickbooks and it just gets easier and easier . and if you need help the team is there , i recommend this especially if you have no real experience u swing an accounting system
. bomb app andvery, very helpful, and useful!!! =)
works like it should!. the app works well and most everything is in the same place as the desktop version.
quickbooks online app. although i do like quickbooks online, the mobile app version is horrible. i downloaded and logged in and it did give me my balance sheet, but said i had no expenses, i could not find a way to put in a journal entry and other reports showed zeros as well. i deleted it from my ipad and will just use the nonapp version ( which you need google chrome vs safari to work properly not a big deal but a bit odd).
. great for on the go, syncs with pc version, keeps my business going as long as there's wifi or cel service, since i work in places with spotty coverage. being able to email invoices and changes on the spot is very helpful.
. this software is extremely easy to use and worth the subscription. i started my business last october and i have no interest in switching. cheers apollo butler c.e.oowner of hornet waste management.
. a great app. for basic functions, app is good. for full functionality, use a desk top computer for acess for online quickbooks is better to use.
. sales receipt and invoice not round off available in mobile apps create invoice not show retail invoice and tax invoice in mobile i am a paid version user and i am pc login all options are work properly but mobile apps issue i have made complete 4 tims in call center but agent ask me team work this issue
great app. convenient, reliable. constantly being improved. keep up the good work!
. useful. allows invoicing, and updates on the go!
not great. there are multiple problems wrong with this program. you can't bill a customer when you attach a receipt which means i constantly have to switch between devices. my expenses according to the customer are incorrect. i'd like to see my estimateinvoice minus my expenses per job. the only reason i switched to this program from freshbooks, which is way less expensive and more user friendly is because quickbooks has a balance sheet, which our accountant required.
too many errors to count. i’ve been using mint for years and love it. this software on the other hand is terrible. save yourself the frustration and use anything else.
network problems. sometimes it says it has network problems and you have to cancel every data you just put in to try saving again. it can be two or three times that happens and that is really frustrating.
horrible photo receipt capture function. the recent update apparently changed the algorithm for identifying receipt paper boundary in a photo that makes no sense at all. two out of three times it only capture a useless fragment of the whole receipt which the makes entering receipts a horrible and utterly frustrating experience.
. your log in process is pathetic. its always asking me to verify and that process takes over an hour most of the time as it keeps resetting to the main log in screen. if you can't fix this i'll cancel my subscription
limited compared to quickbooks desktop. quickbooks online is just ok. it has some limits that did not exist in the desktop version. a lot of them have to do with assisted payroll. for example, the app does not tell you each pay period how much of a contribution to pay towards simple ira's and give you a chance to indicate whether they were paid. it just assumes it was done without giving you any notice. other limitations make it just ok.
need a guide. new user here and i need this apps for my business... but i wanna know how to entry my daily sales..
. great app, love throwing away receipts just take a picture of the expense, document it, and bam, you're done.
unusable.. i'm required by my work to use this appwebsite, and it is completely unusable. after confirming my account via email and twice by text message i get an error message when i try to login. the website also does not function no matter what browser i use on my phone. what a joke.
. great tool for a service business! create an invoice and get paid all at the job site in one easy app
app no longer works. everything was good with it for about 6 months now the app no longer allows me to log in saying there has been a security problem. other devices work told by quickbooks support it was being looked into 2 months ago and still nothing. very disappointed that i'm paying for this to not work
. this used to be a great app, i have used it for 4 years but unfortunately it is no longer working... i can no longer login, i keep getting an error saying it can't sync. i hope this gets fixed soon, i run 90% of my business from my phone and having a working phone app is part of the fee we pay for qb online.
very satisfied!. been using the mobile app for the past 3 months now, and i can say it does everything i need. very easy to issue invoices, receive the money, match, reconcile the bank. the support people are very helpful and have a lot of patience!
so good. best account software available
terrible. glitchy. doesn't update new transactions. hard to navigate compared to desktop qbo app. honestly, intuit knows it can do better than this. they're just greedy.
accept button doesn’t work.. love the app however this latest update the accept button doesn’t seem to work so you can’t accept the new line items from your bank feed.
. cannot open the app. it shuts down with an error.
great!. as a first time business owner and user of any accounting software, i am very happy with quickbooks on the whole and this app in particular. easy to use and understand without over simplifying what needs to be done. seamless integration without just about any software make this a great goto for all your small business accounting needs.
. great app but how does it stand out?
very good app. easy to use. recommended!
app is good support is horrible. call qb for basic questions lady name amanda hang up on me.. dial back in the she place me on hold for 15 minutes
. can't add items i used to live this app. i wished it would work when i add a item. to my invoices evertine i tap add item and choose my item to add it says error add item. it reallly stinks because i loclve using this app while i am in the road. now i habe to bring my computer and take time to find wi fi hot spots to use my computer please fix thia problem. our help me fix it
. just unistalled and reinstalled the app hopefully it is going to work. after doing over 70 invoices it stopped working dashboard showed blank 😕
used to love it. it used to work great, but now it crashes and never loads. wished it worked. i like the ability to snap pics of my receipts.
. great experience. great results. making me run my business. more efficient
awesome app!. started my business with the start of this app since i'm a mobile mechanic and it's awesome to do quotes and invoices on the fly makes it easier to keep customers
how did i run my business without it?. i do half my estimates and invoices on the go with this app. saves me so much time!
. growing to like this app
app close by itself. sometimes the app close by itself. this is really a struggle for me since sometimes i've already input a lot of information then the app just close without saving the information, and i had to reinput everything all over.... waste a lot of time
productivity. love all the intuit products. helps run my business professionally. been able to do my own scorp taxes and payroll for a couple years now. saving me thousands over a cpa and payroll company like in previous years. business owner now for 26 years
. great now i can do alot of my office work while in the field. this app lets me have more time making money instead of sitting at home on computer.
quickbooks app. great, convenience of creating, editing and sending invoices and adding customers, payments or expenses
. always a great experience!
does not work. app does not work. wish it did, but it does not. none of my vendor activity shows up, profit and loss does not scroll past first page. better no app at all than one that does not work.
don’t update to ios 13 if you want this to work. there a so many bugs with this app now that ios version 13 has been released. you can’t even enter an expense now without an error popping up that you need to create a template. quickbooks online support has been no help. they advised i use the browser on my phone. what’s the point of the app then? test test test folks.
100% broken. they must have changed something with the login process. i only get a message saying it's for online users (which i am) and not mac and windows users. cannot even login anymore.
. i am really happy by the way it helps me keep track of my expenses and consumption taxes. one thing i would like to see on the mobile app is being able to view your taxes, same as you can on the desktop version.
. this app is incredible saves me a lot of time from going to my laptop.
nothing quick about quick books. not easy and not quick. out of all the invoice apps i’ve used this has been the most awkward
. excellent lots of options for writing reports and looking up data
junk.. not great. doesn't support photos. i guess thats to be expected from intuit. always a little behind the game. don't bother with support either they are worse. i have had my ipad cleared twice by their support. inventory and all. wonder why the go payments cant work like an invoicing system. talk about the blind leading the blind!
. stupid 2apps at qb idot coders. so you have one app and it is great that tracks mileage and receipts but it doesn't communicate with cloud quickbooks. then you have this app that doesn't have those features. how can you dominate the market and be this foolish someone's going to come along and take their lunch money.
garbage!. they update the app and completely remove support for ios 8! i understand making a newer version only compatible with newer ios, but why block legacy users all together? it worked great on ios 8 before, now the same version of the app suddenly says i need to upgrade! i pay $30month for this garbage!?
. small business owner. this app is terrible, do not not rely on it. does not work well on android devices, no matter how many times the browser is reset along with strong data connection.
new horizons glass wa. works great. do all my bidding and estimates with this app.
. great app!
. very user friendly
qbo app. luv the new dashboard!! excellent app. no complaints.
pretty basic and useless. edit: still can’t see monthly reports. i don’t need the annual pl as much as the monthly. can't do a lot of things. it's very very basic , pretty much a basic overview of your account. you can’t do anything even as detailed as seeing the transactions in a pl report. it’s only broad overview stuff and entering new transactions. can’t even switch cash vs accrual. severely limited and cannot work in a pinch when you can’t use an actual computer.
brilliant. i love the qb app. can invoice on the job. wish i'd used it sooner.
. lacking critical features. you have to manually track down and cut and paste the customers email address when sending a reminder for an overdue invoice. to top that off, there is no audit log. there is absolutely no way to see when an invoice was sent, reminders sent, who it was sent to, etc. this app is worthless to small business owners who work on the go.
perfect app for any small business owner. as a qbo pro advisor my opinion may be somewhat biased but i can not brag enough about the software, customer support and resources offered by quickbooksintuit. qbo has allowed me to become a completely virtual bookkeeping firm, increasing my service area, customer satisfaction and turn around time. love love love them!!
horrible. can't stand the program or customer support
great app.. helps so much w billing... highly recommended. .
loved the app until banking disappeared. i mainly use my computer to do most of our accounting but loved having the app so i could accept banking transactions during short periods of downtime thereby keeping our bank balance up to date all the time. then today i went to catch up on accepting transactions and banking has totally disappeared from the menu. help! what happened? i deleted and reinstalled the app to no avail.
. recently broken. was using this daily on my samsung tablet but as of a couple days ago it stopped working on all my mobile devices. i've sent feedback within the app but still broken. it's frustrating as a paid subscriber to qb.
awesome. great app! making bookkeeping much more enjoyable!
qbo ipad better. qbo for ipad is much better. the report functionality on the ipad is very much effective. if reports functionality is added this app, it would be much better.
easy and convenient. i own a construction business, and have grown very fond of this app. it's really convenient to use the app to maintain our books on the go. my husband and i wear many hats in our business. our time is precious, but quickbooks online helps free up some of that time with its ease of use.
new to business and this is great. i have now completed my second year running my business and without a doubt i owe some of my success to quickbooks as i don't have an admin person it helps me manage things also creates the professional image i need. i prefer using the web platform but when i am on the go and making small purchases for clients i love to add the expenses to their invoice on my phone before i forget!
great flexibility. love being able to do estimates and invoices on the go.
crash. your latest update is crashing. it doesn't let me open the app. please fix immediately
keeps me on track. i'm so happy with qb. makes estimates, invoices and takes payment. that's what's most important to me. haven't used it to pay my bills yet. i'll explore it later. wish i could set alarms to do estimate followup. would be so helpful
roofing business. i have been using quickbooks for almost a year for my husband roofing business and i love it! why we are out looking at jobs i can do an invoice on my phone and email it right away to the customer! and i can go home and work from laptop as well! i recommend quickbooks for book keeping for business!
. great app
"best app tool for small business. i love everything about it. just please change when emailing estimate, remove ""please pay"" and change to total estimate as it is only estimate and not an invoice."
much better. used qbo several years ago and it was horrible. this is a really nice app. good job intuit.
negative stars.... emails won't send to customers... misspelled quantity on invoices... not complicated to fix, no customer service, destroyed my management system, i regret switching...
very good. it should be able to synchronize with quickbooks desk top.the online version on the pc sucks!!!! not user friendly,and very limeted,
a great improvement over the mac desktop version. it saves me tons of time that i used to spend recording payments, expenses and running reports. client payments are easily paid via credit card by the client and automatically applied to the invoice. it has simplified my accounting.
". terrible customer service, took my money for a monthly subscription, then did not activate my subscription and now after 3 days of 10 pm3 am ""customer service"" messages, resulting in absolutely nothing, richie more or less told me i'm screwed and intuit, inc is keeping my money and that i can try to get a refund from google for my intuit subscription. poor business. if anyone wants to actually see what richie says, message me and i'll forward conversations."
. i love this app,it is very helpful
. powerful yet easy to implement. i can help my clients set up estimating and billing on the run and remotely update bank recs, etc
fairly good. not too bad, does most of the things you can do with your browser on pc but i would like to see the ability to update your bank account in the app
recent update worse. with the recent update, the app won’t load and immediately shuts down on me. : can’t access my accounting.
easy. i use it to view the position rather than a tool to raise invoices etc, a nice addon
the best. buy an ipad. shred up your paper estimatesinvoicing. stop using pens. download this app. holy crap i've been in business 4 years and feel stupid after downloading this. plus u look awesome w an ipad. plus everything's stored forever.
doesn’t work like the app on a pc. the fact that the apps are not the same on a pc than on the ipad or mobile is frustrating. can’t see running totals on the register, can’t add transactions the same way, etc. and the kicker is the website version doesn’t work at all on the ipad, can’t scroll through the register because scroll bars are absent in chrome or safari. horrible adaptation and makes the ipad useless to conduct accounting business with quickbooks...
. great app, makes paperless billing a breeze for a small company.
sad. please bring back the mobile app. the online needs improvements. going back to spreadsheets thank you qb.
very easy and great!. i'm not a accountant but i found this app and the software great
. nothing more appropriate and useful for us at this time. qb is invaluable. keep it up folks
doesn't refresh data, data is inconsistent. doesn't refresh data, data is inconsistent
. great app
pretty good. it’s really great but there’s a couple of things you can’t do like work on reoccurring invoices.
time saver!. this app has decreased the amount of time i used to spend in the office by 75%! it's intuitive and the support is fantastic. a great investment for my small business. invoicing and quoting should never be a burden.
. cannot change estimates from pending to accepted on android version.
perfect!. great app with all the functionality i need to take care of business. i can do much of my books on the go and not let things pile up. love this app!
". error message that cannot be fix ""cannot add this invoice, if error continues, please contact support"" that cannot be fix from quickbooks my android app been like this close to 1 month cannot create invoices estimates so on my business suffer cause of that, have use regular computer to create what was said. not good for business all subscriptions are active."
simply perfect. this program allows us to work and function mire effectively
. best investment ive made in my small business more than pays for itself
. great way to write and send invoices in the field
no supplier invoice. invoices from suppliers can not be captured on the app. you have to log onto the main website  which is extremely slow and cluttered to navigate on a mobile phone.
. excellent app and it makes computer blues more efficient.
makes my job easier. love it!
convenient and efficient. this app allows me to create invoices and collect for my plumbing services in the field and takes care of the book keeping simultaneously! i can also email the invoice to my customer instantly, which my customers seem to appreciate.
great software & online support. quickbooks support is great
not working properly after update #2. people have businesses to run!! i understand glitches from freecheap apps. not something that costs $360year. my books don't match from my phone to my computer. the pin still doesn't work, every time i edited an invoice it magically created a copy of an invoice that showed up 2 days later. now i have a ton of clean up to do in my books. it's time for me to find new accounting software.
. great app i love it
update ruined app. since the last update you cannot run credit cards on the app. it crashes immediately when you attempt to. my business uses qb on 25 devices. all crash when taking payments. this has caused a massive issue for us and clients. beware of putting too many eggs in the basket of a company that can be sloppy with the interface they sell you.
do it if you can get it to work. i loved the mobil app but intuit doesn't support it any longer. they want you to do the $54.00month hosting instead. i called twice today to try to get this app working and they said it wasn't their app. if you can get this to sync with you qb software, go for it.
". i laughed at one of the quickbooks employees response to the app being slow... they said their goal is to make it as convenient as the qbo app... lol lol bad comparison. online version is tragically slow, short of (what should be) obvious capabilities, even some quickbooks older versions have had for years. and, when challenged, their tech support essentially says ""we are quickbooks if you don't do it our way or using our workaround then you must be doing it wrong"""
. litterally trash. never works. double invoices . deletes things. stayed loyal as they have promised fixes for over a year now. nothing but a waste of time
exactly what i need. amazing app and way simple to use!
. awesome easy interface for all your accounting and buisness needs.
. great app, handy, easy to use and covers most of the important tasks on the go
mr dak kanani. very good app
business on the run. quickbooks online with the ios app make operating a travel based business on the run simple. log invoices as you go. input estimates along the way. print and mail or email all at once at the end of the day. not to mention the helpful reports and expense management. i couldn't run my business without it.
don't believe the hype. this app is practically worthless. all important actions require you to be on the website. i need to be able to invoice, payroll, and do taxes from the app as i am hardly with my computer.
. i'm getting an error code when i try to click on mileage trips and assign them business or personal. works on desktop but not in phone. other than that it's easy to assign categories for transactions and separate business from personal.
working great. have been using qb for about a year now. has been a great tool for an on the go company like mine. now with the self employed online platform, i might switch up. still looking at which will serve me best. overall great product and customer support gets an a.
. great app
. very easy to maintain my account
great fing app!!. i love this app, everything syncs over so well from the web version. it's very simple to use and makes my job a hell of a lot easier!!
so easy to do books on the go!. i cannot say enough about the convenience of the app. i use it as soon as i get paid to log payments on it novices and enter sales receipts. this app and hiring a bookkeeper have been the best financial tools for the success of my business!
best accounting software. so easy to use. has so many features.
newuser. enjoying the switch from mac to online!
. after some learning of how it works i find it a very good program to use and suites my needs very happy
easy to use. i love my quickbooks app. this is the first year my taxes will be done on time because i didn't have to spend hours at desk!
. desktop on line was great had to upgrade to the new online version ,total nightmare can't fined customer statements or customer credit notes etc. very few reports unfortunately have to use the online version due to the new digital vat rules or would just dump it. online chat is as much good as a chocolate teapot. there must be another accountancy package out there that we can transfer all our quickbooks data to. terrible
i can't look up pertinent information. i can't look up pertinent information on the go while i am meeting with clients, such as a yearly sales history. doesn't do much good for the small business owner. definitely not worth paying so much money for an app that has no functionality in the field.
can’t access. i can’t access quick books off my mobile then i am unable to access it off my laptop as well, i log in and it just does nothing on my laptop and when i log in on my phone it logs me out and says i don’t have mobile access..
. o app é bom, mas ou é uma bug ou é propaganda enganosa, porque diz ser r$13,99 por mês e ao clicar para assinar o preço vai para r$48
app issue. i've been using the quickbooks app for over 6 months and it worked fine. now, for the past week the app will not let me access my company data or the data is incorrect after multiple reinstalls. this is very aggravating and qb's customer support stated it's an ios issue. please correct this issue asap. thank you
app shows incorrect transactions. transactions do not match the selected vendor. works when you have few transactions. once you pass 20k it becomes slow and inaccurate.
i love it. simple and user friendly yet enables to do complex functions of accounting and invoicing.
. fabulous for some things great for running my small business. still lots of room for improvement in user friendlyness.
app crashing ios13. app is crashing in io13
. i love it on my phone . but on my tablet it's slow and says non responsive a lot.
a good assistant on the go. the phone app doesn't do as much as i'd like but i couldn't run my business without the software!
"locks, freezes, and won't sync. updated last week and haven't been able to use it since. i've reinstalled, cleared cache, resynced data... nothing. qb customer service ""can't see any issues with my login"" so who knows ? ive been reduced to entering all my invoices from my computer at home (defeats the purpose of the app doesn't it?). until they fix this update, don't download it."
. super easy to use...love that we can use it on multiple divices. awesome program
. simple and very efficient! send invoices ..receipts taxes. everything in one place! love it!
garbage. this app is junk!! support for this app is useless looks like i will be going back to freshbooks, it may not be a accounting solution but at least it works and i can import my info without manually entering. my business doesn't have time for me to spend hours with support when i need to be taking care of my customers ms support
. now, can't even access some of my clients from the app. i have sent the error logs several times to intuit, but no response. it keeps getting worse. lacking the fingerprint option to login. also, accepting transactions from bank feed in android not as smooth as it is in iphone. app starts freezing after accepting a few transactions. additionally, progressive invoicing does not work in the app. should make it more useful for accountants though, adding bank reconciliations capability would help.
. cool app!
great tool. this app helps me keep track of my business finances and at the click of a button i can see who owes me money or who i owe money to. really useful!!
great. great app easy to use and all but needs a mileage tracker logbook like the quickbooks self employed has
not happy with this. i've used quickbooks for years and have several corporations that i handle on the program. i'm also computer literate and have been a quickbooks tester in the past i'm not happy that it took me a whole day to download and set up payroll and still haven't figured out how to print reports for my customers or check for that matter
. does not work as advertised
"no support. staff is rude. need help checking on billing and the person says it's not my job. you can google the number for that question. i was like what support do you provide? her exact words "" nothing""!"
very unstable!. downloaded the new version but the app consistently crashes just after login. real shoddy development and testing by intuit.
. easy to use app!
extremely limited, useless. inability to enter time activity which is basic functionality that’s extremely useful on mobile.
app crashes. everything was great until one day the app crashed. now crashes every time i open it. reinstalled and same issue. help????
. nexus 10 getting better with every update.
. this app keeps getting error loading items, to invoice and estimates can't use it. i call them for support and they have no support they referred me to log in on the web site and the same happens the search button flashes and dispensers. don't waste your time and money. if any one know about a good and reliable app let me know. this one is not reliable nor is their support.
. best app ever i used
. just was on hold for 20 minutes and the issue is not resolved. the app is not allowing me to save information. also the online platform is not working with third party apps with the new tax rates in saskatchewan (reciept bank) been waiting for that fix for 3 weeks.
. great app to finish your business when not in office
. great app! it makes doing my small business easier!
great app. this is very handy when running a business on the go.
pointless. useless app. can’t even see any supplier invoices etc. what is the point of having the app if you can’t work fully on the go!?
. stop. signing. me. out. of. this. damn. app. especially when i go to the length of setting up an additional pattern password specifically for this application. there is no good reason to sign me out, and it constantly does so forcing me to look up my password.
very helpful. make managing my bussines much easier. good app.
very useful. simple and very helpful
underdeveloped & terrible support. the software is totally undeveloped and does not have the features of the regular desktop version. tech support is horrific, they can't help because they don't have the knowledge. intuit had no business releasing the software to the public it's not even ready for beta yet. the iphone app is worthless!
good for on the road. let's me add invoices and expenses while away from the office, works well.
. i travel for work and this app is awesome. i can write and email estimates, invoices, and recieve payments on the fly. it makes my life way easier.
don't work. don't start. when when it does it don't show all of invoices that are enter
great app. great app
does not work. i have just spotted an ad on the bus in london. installd the app. created an account. it was difficult to activate my account as the app does not read sms itself. all in all, after logon the carches  it is not unable at all. i use galaxy s6.
. non function cant gain acces to app kicks me to google play store. cant make invoices cant get paid please fix immediately
great software all round. quickbooks is easy to use and manage. software and app work easily together. makes small businesses life simpler. love being able to use app to do expenses and invoicing on the go.
limited compared to quickbooks desktop. quickbooks online is just ok. it has some limits that did not exist in the desktop version. a lot of them have to do with assisted payroll. for example, the app does not tell you each pay period how much of a contribution to pay towards simple ira's and give you a chance to indicate whether they were paid. it just assumes it was done without giving you any notice. other limitations make it just ok.
decent....but needs work. the mobile app is laid out decent and does work well for the most part. biggest problem i have is you cannot access product quantities or make any purchase orders with the mobile app. need to fix that.
so helpful. my business is basically my husband and me. when we are both out of the office, it's been difficult to have to wait to help customers. this app has allowed me to to create an invoice from an estimate, accept payment and send a receipt all from the truck!
. love the app..easy and user friendly
easy to use and great features. i moved to quickbooks after trying xero, and find it at least as good for my needs and much better value. good foreign currency support, which is important for me.
. je ne sais pas je connais pas encor
needs better support. i thought this was a great app then it wouldn’t allow expenses to be uploaded, one of the main reasons for using this on the mobile app, support we’re worse than useless and could give no time scale as to when this would be fixed to a small business working on the go this defeated the whole point of using a mobile app, am looking for alternatives
. ☢️ testversion — 30tage  nur englisch 👎🏼 ☢️ deinstallliert ⚠️ edit: aber wozu eine app, wenn ich um die website nicht herumkomme ⁉️
awesome. pretty awesome app. i run a small cleaning business and very versatile.
love tracking expenses.. being able to expenses right at the gas pump just makes sense. taking photos of receipts just makes things easier i wish i would've left the desktop app a while ago.
. i have been using this app for 6 months. $40 subscription doesn't get me receipt capture, but the $10 subscription gets it... cannot get it to save information once i enter it, tells me to call a support line that seemingly cannot help me.
absolutely love it! best business accounting app. great mobile online app tool that syncs with your online quickbooks on both mac and pcs. is everything that you could ever want or need for bookkeeping, accounting, invoicing and estimates.
can't bring myself to use it.. it's nowhere near as useful as the desktop app. i'd love to be able to create an invoice on my phone or tablet and upload photos right from the device. can't do it yet.
excellent tool. this is great as a mobile app.
pretty good. i've been using qb for years to run my small auto repair business. the latest qbo and phone app are pretty good. like the interface. easy to use. only complaint is if i have no internet connection i'm dead in the water. being mobile is occasionally an issue.
. capable app for your expenses and keeping tabs on accounts on the go.
. makes my life easier
phone app fail. what ever opinion you have of qbo ... the phone app fails. it will not let you see the estimates and invoices for a customer. they exist, in your system but they do not show up in the app. everything else.... any other feature discussion... it's all irrelevant. if you can't view basic customer info, the app fails.
still no progress invoicing!. great app for running a business on the road. i wish it had progressive invoicing...
please: give us delayed charge already!. how many times do we have to ask? for the love of gawd, why can i not add a delayed charge on the mobile app?????? this is something you actually want to do when you're at a client, not get them to sign for an invoice every time you visit them during the month.
unable to access quickbooks through ipad. everytime time i try to access the quickbooks it says i need to verify first my login which can be verified by sending an email. when i choose this option it says the time has ran out and goes back to the login menu. i am able to get in through the web but never in the app
bo. very happy with qbo
quick easy access. does most needs, mindful it is not the full program.
non emergency medical transportation business owner. there are obviously some differences between the desktop version and the app. the app gives you real time overview of everything you might want to double check on the go. quickbooks is a great tool and the app is a great extension of it.
great app. coming from microsoft office, i enjoy quickbooks so much. it is so mobile and easy to use. there have been a few questions i had, but a quick search led me to the answer. i recommend the program and the app.
many bugs. need to fix bugs that cause the app to not follow the regular online access. employees can see things they shouldn't (like business income) and are unable to do things they should like entering customer info and invoices.
. this app is horrible. why make something so bad? it needs a complete overhaul. i can't email receipts to an inbox, income transactions don't show gst amount like expenses, i can't view pdf receipts. it's just all round ugly and cumbersome and i've only used it for five minutes. i thought the xero app was bad but it's 5 stars compared to this trash. deleted.
. get error message when i login on a mobile phone. works fine in mobile browser and on the desktop. app used to be great but cant even access the tools that i'm paying for anymore
app. using this app is like being your own accountant. it helps keep track of your income and expenses. i highly recommend to all self employed people.
. fantastic app for keeping my expenses up to date on the go and much more!
ouch. does not have my bank listed. does me no good. been paying for 1 year now. and i see no where how to stop subscribing. cost me over $10.00 a month.
solid for business. great app for a small nonprofit. easy to navigate and i appreciate the prompts!
". the app will not sync to my quickbooks data. an error message appears. i am able to access my data online but not on the app. after 2 hrs on the phone with ""quickbooks"" i am left with ""we don't know"" and no solution in sight. i am a contractor and i use my phone or tablet to invoice etc. now i have all my accounting on quickbooks and can't use my phone or tablet to work it."
. if your running a small business, this is a must have. it makes everything easy and stress free
expenses. how do add an expense thats on a 30 or 60 day account?
. great app & software. very helpful. would be nice to be able to keyword search within all estimatesinvoices.
quickbooks. absolutely great piece of software making my business so much easier to run.
great app for any small business. this is a well polished app with regular updates and new features being added everyday. *credit card transactions are incredibly simple with the intuit gopayment integration. great job on the app guys keep up the good work!
. it's a great way to create quick estimates and invoices.
quickbooks online for the ipad. it works great!! anywhere at anytime. create your customers, create the estimate and then bill it out!! if your smart you will setup the direct payment to your bank account too!!
easy and efficient!. the app serves perfectly to capture transactions on the go, snap a pic and enter amount and accounts then review later if needed on a computer. simple, some people expect this to be fully functional for some reason; if you need a fully functional program then you really should have the appropriate expenses towards computers and software anyways. this app makes the book keeping process easy as cake for clients and the accountant.
always have problems. this application made only to collect money from us and every time they increase their monthly payment always have errors and problems and now big issues that i can not open the application on my phone and no one reply to our email or calls they are totally worst customer service ever
bad update. can no longer accept credit card payments. keep getting error code 6000. tech support advised this is a known issue but no eta on fix. please revert back to previous version.
. easy and friendly app for your business
. awesome... works across all of my devices so i can invoice, receive payment and create customers wherever i am. i can even check to see who has and hasn't paid me and send a reminder email to them if needs be, all from my phone, tablet or laptop... should have used this ages ago instead of previous well known others.
crashed. our quickbooks crashed a week ago. they haven't been able to fix yet. frustrating
like the app. just hope it would be easier to use need better access to my custumers invoice and estimates
great app so far. great app. one thing needed i’d making it easier to change customers info when doing a new invoice for a previous customer but at a new address.
great!!!. super app and awesome program for small businesses. we have only been in business for a little over a year now but we really could not have done it without qbo! love everything about quickbooks! thank you for being part of a successful first year and many years to come.... america spa and pools, llc
owner of shoreline marine inc. great app
decent.. the program is regularly requiring me to update my accounts and will not auto update and refresh my bank accounts. not as user friendly as i thought it would be.
good, but could be great!. it doesn't allow you to giveoffer a customer discount (% off the customers bill). it also doesn't transfer the customer notes from estimates to the final invoice. we have to copy & paste or write the description all over again. otherwise, it's pretty user friendly.
limited company. absolutely brilliant. allows me to create and send clients invoices no matter where i am. without doubt the best accountsbusiness management system available. so simple to use and effective
great value. does all the basic accounting functions you would expect. nice to be able to operate away from desktop situation.
security update  unable to sign in. since the security update for sign in features i'm unable to sign into my account using the app.. defeats the purpose of having it aug 23, 2016  just redownloaded the app and have full access once again. oct 20, 2016  unable to select cash, check or credit account to pay an expense.
great potential but.... the app has a great potential to replace the web version. however i do not understand why most of the features aren't in the app. i can't attach a pdf file to an invoice!! why? .. or i cant send an statement with the app.. why not ? .. why cant add company seal and stamp on the invoices ? ipad is a very capable device.. the app should bring all the features of the online version.
quick books. great app
great apps. like it!
. very good support in bookkeeping
excellent. very sleek design yet powerful features. saves me so much time and bank feeds prevent mistakes. very happy!
. easy to invoice clients and get paid fast.
quick books. the best app ever, easy to use, never had an issue that could not be easily resolved. i run 2 nyc businesses and mostly on the run.
can't tap anything when looking at an individual transaction. banking > new transactions > view transaction let's you see what quickbooks added but doesn't let you edit anything.
quickbooks mobile. can’t print mobile.... on a mobile app. still writing invoices and entering them later 2x the work and the price keeps going up.
. ever since update the app doesn't work & my clients constantly complain about it. especially as it was a feature that sold the software to them in the first place! please sort it out!
. excellent love being able to send invoices as i'm taking to customer face to face.
quickbooks on the go!!!!. i love the program and app. i find that it's easier through the app since i can just take the photo right from my phone. i recommend this for anyone!!!!
chrashing in estimates. the app is great, only hiccup is that it restarts as soon as i go into opening a new estimate
great app but needs improvement. there are various things you can’t do on app .example you can’t set recurring transaction, use batch actions for reminders. for indian users , they have not launched quickbooks payment. there is no customer portal ,there should be system for sending invoice and reminder link via sms overall it is good app and all does the basic stuff but should look forward to integrate above stuff as well
new ios too many bugs. cannot open customer invoices. please correct asap!
. its very good program keeping my books in order, reminding of unpaid invoices connects to external management software, great stuff
. doesn't open, tried reinstalling and clearing cache. used to work.
. great experience
great app. it is what it is. it an app. it won't have all the features of a computer and you should not expect it to. does exactly what i need it to in the field.
awesome app. i really like this app, i can track all my incomes and expenses, it shows my net profit and everything else i could possibly need. i really enjoy using this app.
new update changed invoices. the app shuts down every time i get a signature!!
. the quickbooks app has saved so much time from my life! i can send invoices while i'm traveling, see how my business is doing in a few taps, and save receipts so i don't have to keep them in a file! many more features besides these. i love it!
mgrm. great app
. unable to see customer payment transactions and limited functionality. unable to generate detailed customer statements.
love the changes. when i go and look at the transaction using my iphone... i could see the time when the payment was made... i hope it would also show if it's paid in cash, card or check without clicking the invoice...
. quickbooks is super useful for invoicing clients and sending receipts and estimates. there was a brief period of a few days when it wasn't working that was super annoying because it made me realize how useful it is.
great app. i use that app quite frequently. easy to use and gives me all the information i need to access.
. was working ok then app was updated,. help centre can't give time to fix or troubleshoot to be able to use this whilst out on jobsites not happy at all costing money
user friendly but not without fault. works nicely. has a few issues, but overall gets the job done.
. fácil de usar, excelente para los que los que trabajamos por fuera
help. there doesn't seem to be a way to tie in purchases on to a invoice to charge specific customers. when you call in for help with the app, customer service does not have access to see what you're looking at.
very frustrating. i can't understand why quickbooks refuses to put time tracking in their mobile app. time tracking is weak at best on a desktop but excluding it on mobile makes no sense. as a graphic designer who only sells time, this is close to worthless.
please add signatures options estimates!!!. i love this app but it could offer customer signatures agreeing to terms on invoiceestimates features. for example if i send an estimate via email, customers can reply back with a signed estimate allowing me on the other end to place order since i now have their consent. it will save me a trip on having drive out to their location for a signature. please add this feature!!! pretty pleaseeeee.
. this app has one major flaw in my view. my bank transactions do not update unless i go through the website and update it there. this is probably the only reason i have this app. this is very annoying and i have contacted quickbooks about this issue and they are not helpful. they tell me to go to the website and update it there! would be a great app if they fix this issue.
mick's mowing & gardening. great app very easy to use and very helpful to my business
. this is what happens when a company gets too large. first app worked fine and then suddenly refuses to connect to my bank. customer service is a joke. reps were unable to figure out why error 103 kept appearing. after two hours on the phone i was then told it is a systems issue that needs its own ticket. two days later an email arrives stating that the issue is resolved. guess what, it wasn't!! come up intuit! you can do better than this
. i love this app. it allows me to promptly create an invoice on the spot which allows me to close the deal quickly. every small business should use this app!!
o melhor!. excelente!!! minha ferramenta de gestão financeira.
no longer works on ipad. this app is no longer functioning as of the most recent update. it used to work on the ipad. the camera feature is difficult to use when trying to take a picture of receipt. it doesn't allow me to record payments any longer. please fix.
. very useful for small and midam business company
. often fails to sign in. limited app that hardly works. skip the download and just visit the website.
not happy. when i first got the app i fell in love i had problems with the desktop version , with the bank option on the online version which you removed i was able to log in my transactions very quickly , i would appreciate it if you would please bring back the bank option in the menu asap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
amazing. is a great app, i love doing all our book work from my phone. anywhere anytime. only down full is i can't do the pay run on the app or phone internet. i need a laptop or computer to do it. other than that, great!
dreadful just unusable plus desktop version same. started well. then couldn’t input expenses on the app. hard and long winded to get support. now cant enter invoices and reciepts on desktop version!! totally pointless package and when you have r pugh troubles running your own business!!!!! think i will go back to my accountant and just dump everything with him each month as the hours this is costing me plus unbelievable stress!!!!
meh.... still can’t accept checks as payment in conjunction with payment services on mobile app. lots of glitches...
everything in one place!. i love the ease of use with this app! i was using invoice2go but with the features of this app, switching was a no brainer. rated it four stars only because i've been using it for only a month. otherwise i'd probably give it 5 stars, but we'll see!
. pc or macbook apps are good but i am sorry to say that this app is waste of time. very slow. page loading time is more that 1 min even with wifi having 100mb broadband speed.
invoicing on the go!. the app is a great companion to the online version. allows me to invoice and keep track of billable items on the go. there is so much more it does but for me invoicing right after the job is done gives me freedom to do my office work while having a coffee.
. continues to make me turn phone off and on or delete app it does not work.
. tpforhire.com we are able to be proficient due to this app. thanks
. nice and easy app
bugs and bugs it a jungle. 1. kicking out of the app very often. 2. not able to email multiple invoices at one time. 3. limited search capabilities. cant search notes and description. :(
what a joke. i am not a software developer and who ever designed this joke is not one either
limited features in the app. the app has extremely limited features as compared to web cant send customer statements or edit recurring transactions or match partially paid invoices.
. does what i need it to do.
great app. really like this app but switching from iphone to an android device i miss the expense option in the app. for the iphone you could input an expense on the app with the android you can not. i would like to see that added for the android app.
useful app for sure. thanks for the refresh feature, will definitely make my job easier. 5 stars.
. rubbish, cannot connect to hrmc, hard to then cancel payment
slow at the app not compatible with ipad. something wrong with this app , slowly uploading and not easily manageable on the ipad
no more bank sync?. used to be able to sync to bank in qbo. please bring it back! 37 did refresh but still no bank tab like in qbo with balance?
. has made my life much much easier please include income list
. excellent and simple to use
. good accounting sofware, horrible on intuitively usage. just try and make an estimate or invoice online with an android tablet or phone and you will experience what i am talking about, it is very lacking the ease of usage, also lacking on choices when you select services, clients, and want to make a quarry forget about it! for accounting it works but, to simple for customer management.
exceeded expectations. it may not be perfect but it is way better than it use to be and better than any similar product i have used. integrates well with all my bank and credit card accounts across numerous canadian providers.
. love this app, keeps track of all my expenses and payments from clients. easiest way to do estimates and invoices as well.
not many useful features...yet(?). no access to trial balance or p&l reporting. no access to cash balances. no report writing or report generating capabilities. i guess it's free, but i hope there is a robust pipeline of upcoming features.
. i love the freedom that qbook gives me with the online version i can work at any place out side of the office.. also update are free and there free support team are the best. thanks so much qbook for be there for my business and me..
. this was almost my solution to doing invoices on the road. unfortunately, they do not allow pdf attachments when sending an email. i need to send a pdf not jpegs so until this option is added this app is useless for me.
what happened?. this app used to work perfectly. after the last update i can't use it how i used too. if they do not fix it soon i am going to have to look into other options
love this app!.
sweetness!. clearly...they have small, growing businesses in mind. this app has really brought our company to the next level. we love it!
ok. app ok
like it but needs more features. i can do everything i need to from this app. i would like to see the ability to create purchase orders and pay bills & i just wish they had more integration with paypal.
was enjoying it until ios13 update. this app was working fine until i updated to ios13...... boom! nothing now. crashes on opening everytime.
. i have seen personal budgeting apps that have better user experience than this. here just some of the glaring issues:  it forces you to relogin alot, and it does not support google signin, which means you have to retype a complex password every single time  you could use pin login from settings, but it is useless..  it forces pin code reentry everytime you use the camera or switch to another app.
quick books. quick easy invoices
. great app!
horrible. it’s true the only reason i will install qb on my phone is to record expense on the fly,and it doesn’t do it
great app!. wonderful app.
"don't bother. it says above ""get full access to everything quickbooks online has on the web"". but in fact it is a totally different application geared to salesmen on the road. don't expect to see your accounts here, all you have is:  customers  estimates  your invoices and sales receipts. very disappointing; forget it"
solid app. it works well. highly recommended to business owners.
owner. great app. keeps me up to date.
*terrible app*. do not take the chance with this program its flawed at best and is only designed to take as much money off you for as long as possible. it has multiple errors all the time. find something for better value and don’t pout it in control of your business because when it fails you have no control whatsoever.
great app but missing some key functions. i've used qb online for a year now and its a great service. the app allows me to invoice and record pymts immediately, however i cant seem to enter expenses. if i could do that it would get 5 stars.
complete waste of time.. 100% completely useless and a total embarrassment. in the year 2013 quickbooks is the only company left that cannot figure out how to make their full product work on an ipad. please fire your entire tech department and hire a high school kid with skills.
. nice app
android user. would give it 5 stars if product button was available as it is on apple. great app, easy to use.
love it. it is a great app
. i haven't been able to update a draft invoice via mobile in over 2 years and it's been a known issue? instead of adding new reports all the time, work on the basics please.
. was using quick books online on laptop and it was fantastic, now since have to be on the move, am using on my android phone to generate invoices and it amazing experience, just dont need laptop anymore. great stuff. recommend to all smes
easy and super user friendly. first time user of this type of app but it was easy to set up. sent out my first invoice after 1hr already.
great, but can learn from others. just my observations: mobile app should be mostly used to record expenses. it lacks ocr tracing. moreover scanning a receipt is a multistep process. should add forcetouch to add receipt (open in camera). invoices: been searching how to add my banking information. cannot believe quickbooks does not allow for adding banking information to invoices. did i miss something? or is it a hidden feature? not very intuitive (pun intended). otherwise good. like the integration with bank account.
. i have been a happy customer u till this new update every time i try to logon it keeps saying the internet seems to be offline... now i can not update my sales n payments
. awesome app that assists me to carry out my personal finance activities
excellent app. make life way easy for small business
. really good for simple operations i only needed the app for a small subset of operations.... that is, quickly open,edit, and send an invoice. i am thankful for that capability. perhaps intuit could stress that the app is not intended to be full blast qbo.
. still learning the ins and outs of the app, but so far i love
easy to use and keeps me updated. works great on my s4.
small business. i have been using qb for two years now and i am very satisfied with what the program can do for me. i like the flexibility of being able to use it on my tablet, computer or my mobile phone.
. i haven't done much with the app yet, but so far so good. it seemed difficult at first however; the more i used it, the easier it became
. very miss leading and is nothink like the tv advert. not to easy to use and over all disappointed. having to use it because of my accountant. no impressed!!!! also no english call centre's! you can't understand the customer help line team as there english is poor. needs english call centres employing english to overcome this problem!!!!!
keeps crashing. i absolutely love this app...but since ios 13 install every time i go to use it, it crashes. i sent an email to support but need this rectified. once that glitch is fixed it’s a 4.5 star app!
. incredibly hard to unsubscribe, i have been paying for this app and do not need it after 2 years. i still cannot find the unsubscribe part on google play and have followed the useless instructions to do so. not happy.
great. great app
fantastic. great bit of kit can do everything i need on the go send invoices and put in my expenses
garbage. total trash from the moment of sign up. every single step has been brutal, customer service is non existent and now we have to file dispute through our bank because intuit refuses to cooperate or help with anything. do not use this service. i see them bankrupt within the next few years. customers make the business and they do not care about their customers.
very handy app. so far like this app. i need not go to my computer for bookkeeping or to see what’s going on with accounting. only i am not happy about general entries. earlier, i was able to open and see general entries. now app doesn’t open general entry. when i tried to open, it took me back to homescreen.
i'm trying the app now i have a question. can i acess from a pc too? or is it only for the phone?
love it. business owner love this app
good unless u need their help. i had a problem as accidentally created 2 companies in the one profile. subscription applied to wrong company and they had no idea how to fix it. the company with all my accounting was cancelled as ‘trial ended’ but other company with no data was fully subscribed. very frustrating when dealing with idiots in the phone!
. it's useful, but often behind the ios app. still waiting to be able to raise po's on the app  that would be super helpful when onsite with suppliers.
. thank you for the update guys 😊 perfect accounting app for my firm
not free it's a trial. you should be more specific when choosing name. you shouldn't misdirect people with it.
. simple, fast and easy to use
helpful app 😊. so far very satisfied with this app. able to record expenses and deposits on the go and quickly. less time spent doing tedious book work. two thumbs up! 👍🏻👍🏻
quickbooks online + app. quickbooks online is making my business accounts so easy. the bank connections feature allows you to sync online accounts straight into your account records. when new transactions are available, you can view and add them straight into your accounts, made easier by quicbooks match feature that marks transactions with previous similar transactions. support during setup period has been excellent which has made switching from another online accounting software quite an easy process. very impressive so far.
lacking. this app has potential, but it's lacking. especially the fact that you cannot make deposits on the mobile app, only on the desktop version.
unable to access quickbooks through ipad. everytime time i try to access the quickbooks it says i need to verify first my login which can be verified by sending an email. when i choose this option it says the time has ran out and goes back to the login menu. i am able to get in through the web but never in the app
. great app
easy to use. keeps me on top of my expenses every day. should have started using it months ago!
. good apps
president. i’m busy right now trying to invoice, from customer service to user friendly software qb is on point for the business man. love the service for sure.
. easy to create an invoice, a little difficult to look a customer's information via the phone app.
i love it!. works great! love the accessibility, i use the app to send invoices easily while i'm on the go and my clients can pay online, through the invoices i send them. definitely worth every penny!!
great app!¡. im always on the go and this app is great when invoiceestimate has to be sent immediately or when there is no computer access¡¡ highly recommended for biz on the go!!
. i would like to be able to invoice from the app.... but other than that, i love it.
not great. there are multiple problems wrong with this program. you can't bill a customer when you attach a receipt which means i constantly have to switch between devices. my expenses according to the customer are incorrect. i'd like to see my estimateinvoice minus my expenses per job. the only reason i switched to this program from freshbooks, which is way less expensive and more user friendly is because quickbooks has a balance sheet, which our accountant required.
update crashed. i have all of my quickbooks point of sale ipads that cannot open the app since the update! we have all had to resort to computers and phones to run our business! you may want to consider this before you join up with quickbooks! they are notorious for problems relating to their quickbooks online.
amazing!. this app undoubtedly helps running multiple businesses on the road possible! when i finally switched my businesses from desktop to online there were a few things missing. i wrote a few complaints and spoke with their development team...few short months later...boom! additions were made! one if which is being able to switch businesses within the app. definitely much easier than logging in and out all the time.
great app. makes life easy. one addition will make it perfect. add journal entry to the app.
great way to keep track of business nunber on the go.. although it's not as good as the pc version it allows you to keep track of expenses as you make them while your away from the business.
updates have made it horrible. i love using the online version. the august updates however have tanked the app. it is no longer sharing information between my iphone, ipad, and mac. the sorting feature of estimates is now gone ( pending, accepted, closed) it only shows in last changed order, not good when working with 3 month or longer history. on a positive note, i do like the photo modification for the iphone. it no longer adds to my photo album, just imports to quickbooks.
great app!. this app has saved me tons of time and i love it!
the best. this app is the best for my businnes, when i use him as a contractor is the best, because i never lost money or forget charge any work. i love it.
update = crash. haven't been able to use app since updated. disrupting my business. will not open.
. very user friendly app to use
getting better. you can keep doing more and more on phone. great for us small business owners. it would be 5 but when i first downloaded there was not a lot to transactions you could complete on app.
. very professional app
. free try option does not work. what's the fun of offering trial that doesn't work
great app. i am enjoying staying on top of things while on the go.
horrible. i cant log in just says all the times error error error very bad app
. seriously guys, this app is constantly updated, but still moves at a glacial pace and consistently crashes. get your business in order so we can keep ours in order!
just what i needed. i run a small contractor business doing remodel work. the mobile app has been a godsend. i can track all my estimates, invoices & expenses in one place. helps me track clients that are late payers too (which sometimes happens). i like it. 100% worth the subscription
. acho ótimo, muito organizado e intuitivo, tanto para uso profissional quanto pessoal.
does not show suppliers. since update app does not show suppliers or let you add expense, which makes mobile app a waste of time
. apps bad after last update... you can't easily see invoice and or estimate amount anymore, you have to click each invoice & estimate to see numbers... i will be changing program's soon if not fixed.... we need to be able to easily scroll up and down the hundreds of open invoices and see where things are, not open each invoice to get information... way to timeconsuming... can't screenshot what's going on because the update before prohibits this now.... please devs fix
crashes. keeps crashing. can't use app at all.
good. nice app
. good software, i find it a bit challenging compared to my laptop version.
horrible app even if subscribing!. subscribe to the app yet they want me to pay for a new subscription, waste of money for months!
. love this app!
. frustrating. slow. pretty much only to be used for creating invoices and receiving payments. maybe reports. wanted something that functioned just like the online version but for my mobile. wanted to catch up on work at opportune moments without having to get the laptop out. would not recommend. client hates it.
. love this app
time saver. saves time to be able to categorize expenses from my phone.
. easy to use and my accountant recommended it highly.
. takes way to long to update between quick books online.
. easy to use, nononsense basic accounting software that even firsttimers like myself can master. smooth invoicing, affordable, all you could really ask for. not as fancy as se other accounting software out there but then again, for a sole trader like me, more than sufficient.
tremendous. great app been using quickbooks over the years on desktop version specially go on mobile is the best way to go there is a couple tweaks that need to be worked on for example keeping track of inventory etc. and so forth been using quickbooks pro help ticket update these features as quickbooks from other than that it's a starter
data sync is not working. managed to get it to work. the sync only work after you pay the subscription. doesn't work during trial period. (there is an error syncing data. error code 132. 100. unable to work with it.) another problem with this mobile app is that it is unable to change the status of the estimates.
. very easy to use. easy to understand. cheaper than hiring an accountant. love this very much.
excellent resource. this app is a great resource to both me and my clients. so much instant functionality at your fingertips.
so necessary. if your an small business owner quickbooks is an essential tool that makes it all pain free. you can even invite your accountant into your books and let them get the info they need easily. great software!
really good!. overall i think it's a great app. the one thing i would like them to add is the total dollar amount in the invoice section. in other words it would be nice to see a dollar amount on the tabs for open invoices and past due invoices.
. excellent app
quickbooks. very good app i will purchase after my trial thanks
should of bought it ages ago. such an easy to use app and system, back up support were quick precise and friendly. well done quick books
. the app is excellent!!!
update breaks layout in iphone xr. latest update breaks the invoices page layout. long client names force the amount column into a single space column. now the amounts show like this. $1 2 3 4 instead if this $1234
useless. won't accept my phone number so can't go any further ill look elsewhere for a app that works
. great app. keeps all my business expenses in order.
owner. great app
. we're learning how to use. it seems to be very usefulbeneficial. my guys are picking it up quickly. easy to learn
great for my business. ❤️ this program
. would give it 5* if i could see the summary view on the app (similar to the web version). i wish it could do everything that the desktop version could do, but i know that isn't always possible. *edit jan 2019* love the summary view, the app rocks
never worked. downloaded app but it has consistently failed to open. only the message 'unfortunately quickbooks online has stopped'. tried all the suggested work rounds, uninstall, clear data, clear cache. called help centre and their agent couldn't have been any more disinterested. appalling customer service. not worth subscribing. dreadful service.
. as a selfemployed individual, you get no support. do not buy. wasted over two hours on the phone with various customer service reps and was informed that you get online support. lost three weeks of work in few mins. they won't even give me refund. wish i can give negative stars!!!
useful but slow. quickbooks online in general is useful for sending out invoices and estimates on the go, going through expenses, etc... however the platform can be fairly slow and sometimes glitchy.
. hi, is there any option for download ar sheet inexcel on mobile app. kindly let us know.
very useful mobile app. i don't expect my mobile version (android) to replace my desktop version. for checking customer balances, emailing invoices, and receiving payments it's a perfectly useful app. quick and easy access to invoices, customer balances, expenses, customer info, p&l and balance sheet. i'm not running or expecting more sophisticated reports from my phone! works great for what i need!
great app but. i have been using the desktop 2012 version and have been used to navigating that. the online version would do well to have a more compatible and similar version for experienced users.
. doesn't allow me to add my other business. i had to go to the website, add it, sign out of the app and back in again before it showed up. given the app has an setup business flow, you'd think they'd let you use this to add another.
rubbish. will not let me log on just say i don't have an active subscription when i do....
. easy to navigate! great app!
boost to my business image with my ipad!. i went from handwriting every estimate, sales receipt and invoice to bringing in new paperless technology. at the end of the day i would have to have my wife input everything in our quick books online. then file everything in our office. it's not only impressive to our clients, but it also eliminates filing and an extra step of data entry, it saves time and money and gives you a competitive edge over your competition!
latest rev still buggy. when adding a new customer, cannot import contact info besides names. address email and phone numbers not automatically being added while accessing phone contacts. also receiving consistent home error message of being unable to access company info.
. the app has no way to change to accural from cash basis
. this is seriously a great app. thanks devs
horrible service. very limited in functionality compared to desktop. my company couldn't use it.
just no. the app isnt compatible with the galaxy s7 which is really inconvenient. 👎👎👎.
"not there yet. out of the three versions of qbo, the ipad version here is definitely the weakest. in design terms it shows very little similarity to the osx version, lacking much functionality as it does. it is still impossible to switch between my two company accounts. logging out and then reentering my long secure password is an unnecessary pain. this could and indeed should be so much better. in english parlance, intuit need a ""kick up the backside""."
pool guy. quickbooks forced me to update from our quickbooks mobile windows invoicing system to quickbooks mobile with only five days notice. this was very poorly planned by quickbooks and put us in a bind. however the new quickbooks mobile online system is truly fantastic and offers many more powerful features and ease of accessibility. recommendation: this app needs the ability to create a monthly statement that i can email from my phone to my customers. currently i can only do this from a laptop.
convenient app. fast and easy way to update my account plus banking syncable
awesome! a must for small business.. may seem a tiny overwhelming at first. just stick to it and you'll learn to love it! so simple once you get the hang of things ;)
wonderful app!!!. couldn't sing the praises high enough. i run a small, single member managed llc and the quickbooks online app is everything i need. i can create and send invoices and sales receipts on the go, even have the customer sign right on my iphone or ipad.
. love this app.
. might need to buy an apple phone again this android version is useless.
great app. for my business is been really helpful app. i'm a painter contractor, check job all day, if i need to send estimates and invoices now i can do it on the road.
. great app
quick books app. it works as good as my computers program! i can do the work i need to right from my phone!
great but has a long way to go. was so excited to migrate to qbo but now that i'm here, there are so much important elements that are not here  bills payment stub or remittance advise doesnt even have a reference or a check #.
very beneficial app. this is a very beneficial app. it does not replace the pc version but is an excellent aid. it's helpful to send invoices on the go or at the end of a service call. the sooner the customer pays the more chance you will get paid. as long as you keep things simple it is a very good aid!
. great app
. the creator of this app is a known sex offender
nice app!. suits my needs...
so helpful. my business is basically my husband and me. when we are both out of the office, it's been difficult to have to wait to help customers. this app has allowed me to to create an invoice from an estimate, accept payment and send a receipt all from the truck!
signature issues. the app crashes every time i get a signature or it doesn't save the signature. please resolve this issue. it has now been a week and this is still an issue.
it's a good app. very convenient. the mobile app isn't perfect, and as some have pointed out a few features are missing in the mobile app. but qb is convenient. i can take payments, check accounts, and do basic things while i'm out and about. it's good, and quickbooks online support has been great lately.
. love the app
update killed app for me!. used to love this app as i’m a paid subscriber, but the recent update doesn’t launch anymore. i’ve tried removing and reinstalling same result. iphone x.
time expense and mileage. great product. inconsistent functionality across desktop, iphone and ipad. for us professional service peeps can we have time expense and mileage please!
great app!!!. this is a great app for my small business. i can make and send out invoices from my phone. which is great!!
. great app. no issues
my best weapon !! mi mejor arma !!. i own a landscape company, we do lots of renovations and i love to take pictures before & after and attach them to the invoices !! soy dueño de una compañía de jardinería, hacemos un montón de renovaciones y me encanta tomar fotografías antes y después de que se adjuntarán a las facturas!
. love that there is the mileage and receipt tracker now. i was disappointed when there was an entirely separate app and to see these added has made me very happy
crashes. a lot.. new upgrade crashes. a lot. allowed me on just long enough to click 'leave a review'. then crashed. again.
good so far. i'm new to this app. seems to work good so far. if it changes or if i can suggest something i will when i know more.
error add item. ne fonctionne pas, toujours un message d'erreur quand je veux entrer un item ou une description. impossible de faire une facture avec mon mobile !
great app for business. love this app. great for my work as i'm mobile 90% of the time. certain features that i can't access on the app easily than on the desktop.
. this was almost my solution to doing invoices on the road. unfortunately, they do not allow pdf attachments when sending an email. i need to send a pdf not jpegs so until this option is added this app is useless for me.
. es un excelente programa, pero no encuentro opción para idioma español, está disponible en español la versión mobil ?
great app!. this is a great app! only reason for 4 instead of 5 is that there is restrictions to the app but not online. i do all my business from my phone so it would be great if the app was more adapted so i could do everything from my phone.
. this app has been doing a great job of helping me run my business for over 5 years now, very easy to use. highly recommend
great way to get my money in and estimates out.. really happy quickbooks enables me to work anywhere creating on the spot estimates and invoices making my cash flow work better for me. great app
so so. hard to understand how to do a lot of things, and frustrating at times. customer service though is very good, i just wish i had more time to work with them.
how do i remove this app from my iphone?. i do not want to use thus app and now i cannot uninstall it from my iphone. l try by holding the icon and get a message asking if i want to share it. does not show in my settings so i cannot delete it there either. can't find online help.
. great software. so easy to use and very reliable.
no supplier invoice. invoices from suppliers can not be captured on the app. you have to log onto the main website  which is extremely slow and cluttered to navigate on a mobile phone.
love using quickbooks!!. i love using it and it makes my business so easy and don't even need to carry my computer. i can actually do all of my invoices estimates anytime anywhere with my cell phone!
ouickbooks. setting up this quickbooks app is a joke , the system does not work and customer support has an attitude that is not willing to help!
. this apo no longer works. i cannot make invoices, sales receipts, etc. i called quickbooks and they said there is nothing they could do. i have a mobile business and relied on this app, now it's useless.
easy to use. look, read a lot of the reviews and people are expecting their own accountant with this program. it does what is needed to keep your finances in order. if you want 4 ,ill ion graphs to impress and be bigger then you are....go hire a team. great product, easy to use, tracks everything for me, keep my books straight, and recommend it to everyone.
waiting for updates. quite frankly, it's been totally useless. the app does not sync new data entries with the online database. i've already spent well over three hours with multiple customer support reps. the idea of creating invoices is great....only problem....it does not work!!!
excellent app and service.. great product.
perfect software for the right companies. i absolutely love it! i have a small freelance design company, so i'm billing for services and commissions. there is nothing i need that it doesn't do and do well. i don't need inventory, estimates or payroll, so this program is about as friendly to me as it could possibly be.
very helpful. make managing my bussines much easier. good app.
nice app. its very useful application.
. makes my job so much easier
limited usefulness. app is fairly thin on functional features. if you aren't doing invoices might as well go to the real website instead.
disappointing. this is a very unstable product with an unreliable app server. if my accountant didn't require it, i would not use it! my deposits have not updated for two weeks. i'll let you know when that's fixed.
biggest disappointment. the biggest disappointment is no ability to do purchase orders. when i’m out in the field this is a huge disadvantage and i still have to break out the laptop!
partial funcionality. useless for my business, i have to do my accouting work on a computer, this app doesnt have what i need
easy to use and navigate. love it.... it's a huge step up than our last accounting system. love that the reconciliation is so easy.
great app for accounting on the go!. i don't know why people are disappointed in this app it's an app, not an entire accounting software. plus it's free! i love this app. i can create, manage & send invoices on the go. that's all i need to do. it has a simple interface. kudos to qb.
. we use this to track our business expenses and are so pleased with the functionality of it! it just gets better with each update.
. i do invoices and print from my recliner. love this app. and sometimes generate estimates minutes after finishing my work before leaving the clients home. very convenient !!
everything i need. the quickbooks app has met every one of my needs for my small handyman business. i love the ability to email customers estimates, invoices, and sales receipts while i am standing there with them. i have only been using the app for a little over a month but i feel good about my decision to go with quickbooks online.
love it. we love quickbooks online, we would be lost without this app and online access. thanks quickbooks :)
doesn't work for ipad. this app doesn't even load my company info. it keeps returning error trying to load company info. i have contacted quickbooks a number of times and all they say is they are working on the issue and to use a web browser version in the mean time. i have seen about 4 updates released and not one of them has fixed this issue. when will this be fixed?
perfect for my small business. i am a wedding photographer and quickbooks online is the best way for me to keep track of my expensesrentals and write up a quick invoice or estimate while i am on the road. i absolutely love how user friendly it is. as long as i have my smart phone i can work from anywhere.
love this app. helps a lot with my work
can not save estimates. i'm able to imput items for estimates but error message pops up when i try to save.
major flaw  can't run payrol. 3 stars as you are unable to run payrol on the go which is a major part of this app that is missing.
keeping it together. love this app it really helps me keep my books in order.
no option to add revenue into qb. there is not option, i have found, to integrate revenueincome related transactions into quickbooks. topnotch when it comes to documenting expenditures, but lacking when it comes to revenueincome
is this a lite version? where are the other features?. the features included in the app are good, but i wish it was a bit fuller. it's like a lite version. more capability with a paid add maybe?
needs updates. same app. works okay but very limited functionality. i figured since online version was updated they would've made changes here too. disappointed at how's long it's taking qb to add accounting functionality to this app.
. great functionality for an app
qb makes me look good. qb app is fantastic. i can write and present an estimate right at the job site or give my customer an invoice, or accept payment. in brief....it makes me look good!
. great app, much easier to invoice customers.
sloooooooowwwww!!! iphone 6. very slow to do simple things like log an expense. camera feature is useless with crop feature. can i have the option to turn this off? just wanna take a photo without auto crop which 90% does a bad job. other than that its great :)
useful app. simplified accounting package.
. this is false advertising. it's not free!
. great app. now if they could only add payroll...
. terrible app
. quickbooks banking is my favorite part of the app, because it's easy you catergorise all your expenses and incomes. the dashboard shows an overview of your financial situation.
. not functioning as many have stated to be having the same issue unable to view customers invoices ect on the home screen obviously a common major issue need a fixing
not happy any longer!. having issues logging in every single time now, very frustrating and not happy at all. always asking for finger print, and when typing in my password, it takes about 5 attempts before it’ll login to my company info. also having a constant lag when trying to inputsubmit any items to customers. this is extremely upsetting when trying to submit invoices before a deadline.
need to be able to add bills and accept transactions’s that should match to bills. i think the title says it all. qbo is amazing such a great product but the app needs more functionality. mainly the bills, i need to add a bill from my phone and then be able to match multiple bills as one payment to relevant bills on payment. so frustrating having to find a computer to do this.
. everytime i try to log in i get an error! i've restarted and uninstalled and it still won't work
great app. i love working with quickbooks i can take it with me anywhere i go and makes everything with my business that much easier. i have used other apps that were good but they didn't tie everything together like quickbooks. i highly recommend it.
independent contractor. i love this app being able to have everything on my phone... the monthly dues are definitely worth it!
. i love how this apps keeps me and all my expenditures, finances and all in check. extremely handy for my small business!
request. how can i easily find the last price charged to the customer on a specific item?
. love this app love this app
makes life simple. makes keeping the books alot simpler. cits down on time spent in the office
"issues. it was working fine on my ipad up until last week. then starting bugging. not all customer transaction appear on the mobile app. called customer service about it. they told me that they were ""working on it"". we shall see. i pay for it monthly...i asked if i still had to pay this month even though it's not working as advertised...answer was yes. not happy with that answer. i will keep you posted. bob"
credit card payments. with this new update, i cannot select payed with credit card without being prompted to swipe a card. i use square for my credit card transactions, so i don't need to use qb. only cash and check can be selected now.
. full featured app! quickbooks makes it easy to stay organized. this full featured app brings the desktop to you. easy to make invoices on the go.
lousy service. spent all morning trying to upload an expense only to be told i had no internet connection. can't it determine i have no server connection? so most of the morning i spent in one que after another and finally hanging up. i must say that the convenience of being mobile outweighed the inconvenience of not having too much versatility, but only if i am able to be mobile. i hate wasting time, and so i want payback.
great app. i love the app
overall i recommend this app. i have a mobile veterinary service and use this for all of my billing while i'm on the road. it saves me time by allowing me to bill my clients on site at the time of service, and even process the credit card if they choose to pay that way. the only downside is that the cost per month lewis going up.
great for small business owners.. awesome app. very convenient and keeps the finances and work orders organized. takes some trial and error but well worth the effort to learn this system. you tube has many instructional videos on how to expedite learning this program. price is reasonable for what you get. don't hesitate to get it. if anything you will learn something.
crashing. updated to ios 13 and now the app keeps crashing after face id, please get this sorted as i can’t run my business
. this software has been critical in keeping track of invoices.
love it. just be cautious when trying 30 free trail. i loaded half a dozen customers and lots of estimates,invoices etc. and then purchased the 6 month subscription after i got familiar with software. well it led to doing work twice. because you can only have one or the other, free trail discounted 6 months subscription.
. this app works well for small businesses such as mine. convenience on the go.
"so disappointing. in a never ending but now predictably disappointing offering that intuit calls its cloudbased offering ""quickbooks online"" we have a fantastically buggy and seamfull application with even more limited functionality than the web application. unfortunately it's a ""beggars can't be choosers"" scenario yet again as intuit continues to monopolize the market by utilizing profits for acquisition of competitors, rather than listening to customers to develop it's cloudbased core competencies. shakes head in disappointment."
latest update crashing on iphone 7. great improvements in the app. extra features are a great bonus. well done. on iphone 7 the app crashes when upon opening banking is selected. i've reproduced 5 times.
pres. good product except for email. if you email invoice and customer does not receive because of their sever being down, you never get notified. this can be a real problem because you do not find out until the customer is past due on the invoice..
. its great experience
still does not allow entering employee time. the ability to enter employee time is a must for professionals that are on the road all day. other services like freshbooks already have this ability. until intuit makes this very important addition to the mould app, it does not deserve 5 stars!
perfect for small business. keeps me financially organized with income and expenses. easy to use and reports are complete. perfect for my small business.
. best app for doing business on the go! best customer service by far!
new to app. am enjoying being able to automatically list expenses & add receipts as i go. other apps promised this but kept crashing. i feel that i can now better control my finances.
. great app
. great app use it all the time
can't bring myself to use it.. it's nowhere near as useful as the desktop app. i'd love to be able to create an invoice on my phone or tablet and upload photos right from the device. can't do it yet.
solid. i like that it keeps sync of everything smoothly. there's no wait time, and if so i never notice it. it's fast and convenient. best accounting software hands down!
. be warned easy to subscribe almost impossible to cancel subscription has been at it for hours it seems like an undertaking of several days will try again tomorrow.
. the quickbooks app allows me to easily manage my business expenses on the go and eliminates the need to keep those annoying receipts. instead you can jt take a picture of the receipt and attach it to the expense. brilliant.
great app. like it.
. we tried the free trial before purchasing.. quick books keeps changing my partially paid invoice to paid in full .. when i called tech support he told me to fix this problem its 129.00he was rude and started to raise his voice after i started hows it possible i have to pay that much for a free trial app when they are the ones causing the problem... quick books is no good.. and their tech support is the rudest customer service i've ever heard!
different. this is so different than qbo that it renders itself useless. i cannot rely on it for any accurate information. the only feature that is good is the receipt capture.
okay. i'm new to doing my own bookkeeping and find this product clunky and not very easy to use. issues with importing transactions and program changing dates and the order compared to the bank. it's not very easy to see what account transfers are moving tofrom. it's hard to distinguish credits for debits. poor customer service. no good summary graphs. slow to attach receipts. multiple clicks to do basic things. cuts off file names if there too long.
description is misleading. there is no way to enter or see expenses in this app and of course no way to attach receipt pictures to these expenses. you can enter expenses using computer and attach picture of receipt there, but not in this app. if you need a plug in to do that, why not to say so? or just remove missing components from description.
buggy app. doesn’t even open, tried many times opening it on my iphone x for weeks. it doesn’t even open the app and there hasn’t been an update to fix that for ages. unable to use it on my phone and having to use it on my laptop which i don’t always have it on hand. please fix this issue.
non functional. could not edit invoices, tried to edit terms would not allow very frustrating
keeps crashing. every time i try to upload a receipt from my phone, it crashes when i press save & doesn’t save at all. i’ve tried closing the app & trying again, but it does it every time, so basically i can’t take a picture of any receipt & upload it. please fix! update: i still can’t upload a receipt unless i take a picture of it elsewhere & upload vs taking a picture of it on the app.
better than sage. with a properly functioning mobile app, square integration & receiptexpense management, 10 times easier to use than sage(simply accounting)
simply amazing for the newbie!!. as a sole trader, i am so impressed at how simple this product is to use!! it has saved my bacon on a number of occasions!! collating reports at an instant!! not to mention looking professional to my clients every time i send an invoice !! highly recommend this to anyone wanting to commence on the journey of being your own boss!! what a game changer indeed!
having issues with iphone 11. after installing the app, and attempting to access it results in crashing.
. the app has never been that useful and honestly i feel like quickbooks is losing my favor. now the app won't change the dates on reports. we live in a day in age when i expect to be able to access information when and where i need it, and if i can't count on something then i need to move to something i can count on.
great app. the app takes a bit to get used to but once you've played with it a bit it's very simple to navigate, update bank transactions and so on
. best app
. great app, very ready to track income and expenses. making and tracking invoices is so easy even easier then on the computer, reports and everything is really easy to access and track.
stopped working after the update. this was working great until the software update last week. now i end up creating multiple copies of invoices and estimates and the app just freezes on the saving screen. i can only finish off by logging in through a web browser and completing the task. please fix this fast intuit!
. needs a millage tracker as per your other app. this app has almost everything i need. would be 5 start with that addition
horrible. not even worth commenting on!
doesn't work. won't open on the ipad
almost usless. the app does not show all the info like logging in from a pc. also scrolling up or down on a page is very glitchy. quickbooks has a lot of work to do on making this app useful.
quick book rocks. best accounting package ever made. it links to your bank . cards directly. no need of much accounting knowledge. provide login to your accountant. operate from anywhere.
. best accounting software! worst customer service ever!!!! hold times are hours & when you finally get a person, which is a miracle, they get offended if your upset & will hang up on you!they do not want to help you, just keep you trapped in their maze paying that monthly (rediculous) price! all they want is your money! & will hold your important business info & data entered as ransome. *horrible business practice*
great when working. this app is a great app , however every time that apple do an update it seems to cause issue in regards to the program recognising that you have a up to date subscription
like not love, needs work. our company works on the road, and is trying to eliminate paper invoices. the problem is that we can’t get signatures on the invoices if we use quickbooks in the work trucks on the job. this is a big deal because us getting a signature on the invoices can mean the difference between getting paid or not.
no ability. i download the app and signed up, then i realized that i have to be self employed
not like the online version. the app is alright. missing a lot of feature (if you compare it to the online version) but if they come up with a solution and have them on the app version i would rate it 5 stars.
. quickbooks has saved me so much time
switching between account requires logout and login. so annoying, especially since there is no support for touch id. why can't you let us switch from within the app?
. i am finally happy 99% with qb online quickbooks has finally added the ability to add expences through the android market. it is now, by far the easiest way to send out estimates, invoices and add expenses. i'm a contractor and it works perfect for what i do. well worth the $40.00 a month, trust me. ............
useful app. the app is very helpful for my business, i just which the stock category could be more detailed towards distribution more. but i do give the app the thumbs up 👍🏾👍🏾
. in general this is a good accounting app but lacks some of the features of the desktop site. the automatic email from the app and the desktop site is also more like its promoting qb than my organisation. new projectclient costing is very good so far.
recommend for one stop booking & accounting. i tried many softwares for accounting , the only reason i choose this platform because of its graphics & designs , the dashboard itself give you a ray of positivity , they design the dashboard and entire platform graphics in future aspect. apart from it there customer service is also and helpful. cheers !! ashutosh
. great program and very user friendly
. web version is working but not the app.
great tool. its great tool for small business. makes my life easier. recommend
basic functionality. just signed up for quickbooks online. the android app installed fine on my new samsung tablet. no issues running and using app. however, the app is minimal functionality. there is also no good dashboards like the pc or online web version of the program. pretty disappointed being development of such features is not complicated nor expensive for a home dashboard.
easily the worst app on ios. this is the single worst and buggiest app on the app store. it is buggy, gives random permissions errors, and generally fails to get the job done.
. this mobile app now wont update banking. which is no good for a mobile business without running laptops.
great software. this does everything i absolutely need it to do. i wouldn't use anything else it's easy to manage they have great customer service and i don't have any complaints about it keep up the great work thanks for making my job a lot easier.
great for business on the move. this app is a solid connection to your quickbooks and allows for quick and straightforward posting of expenses, invoices and estimates.
decent. not as full featured as website
great way to run a business. the way razorsync and quickbooks works together makes it possible for me to have a life after work! there are a few more things that would make life easier but overall a big thumbs up! one more star for a stronger search engine, can't find invoices by number or customers by address
. concept was good. but too many errors. could not work at all
awesome. this app is so good i'm so glad i have it i would be lost with out it
best app for any business. i'm a musician and this app helps keep track of all my gigs and insures proper payment!
. great app.
. really easy to use
ios 13. app crashes before opening! please fix asap!
. awesome app use it everyday on the go.
very nice.. very helpful considering that is cloud app. i work with it everywhere a go.
convenient but with glitches. while adding transactions from bank register, transactions get duplicated and doubled.
ipad perfect until ios 8.5. app hasn't worked since 8.5 update. have sent several request about the app crashing and no one has gotten back to me. i've deleted and redone loaded, rebooted ipad, etc. when not crashing it's a 5 star app. please fix asap!
love the app. wish though we could do the same on the phone i can do on the computer.
mobile app yes. i love being able to use the mobile app for quickbooks. you can't do everything you can online but it's great being able to knockout some tasks on the fly and i can show results in an instant, which is a good motivator.
. unable to edit or delete products on setup pretty disappointed couldnt load suppliers not an easyapp at all. plus the set tutorial is different to app presented for 10.95 a month
great app. so easy to use.
awesome app. feature rich and also user friendly
. nice. i can invoice right on the job. my clients can pay their bill through the email which is huge. more time with my family and less time wondering if the check is in the mail.
. now, can't even access some of my clients from the app. i have sent the error logs several times to intuit, but no response. it keeps getting worse. lacking the fingerprint option to login. also, accepting transactions from bank feed in android not as smooth as it is in iphone. app starts freezing after accepting a few transactions. additionally, progressive invoicing does not work in the app. should make it more useful for accountants though, adding bank reconciliations capability would help.
not useful at all. this app was written by someone who does not understand quickbooks and its purpose. get back to basics please if this is to be used by us.
incomplete and not easy to use. privacy settings are lacking as they previously were in the online version. to be useful, i need to be able to pass the ipad to a sales associate sioux giving them the amount of access they currently have (with the limited privacy settings). also, the login and password system is cumbersome meaning it isn't quick to open up the app to charge a customers card (faster to run it through the online version)
awesome app. i run a small business and i use quick books to manage my entire business! from estimates to invoices to getting paid its all so easy and fun to use! thanks guys
. the perfect accounting software for people on the go.
. great app .... just makes life easy!!!
. what a faff! absolute joke, can't create items on android useless
". you broke the app!!! can't attach pdfs to invoices anymore!!! it litteraly worked yesterday, and today a ""new"" interface. make a deal with adobe and fix it now!!! update no your solution doesn't help. i already new i could do this on the desktop version. app is still broken and your proposed solution is just as useless as you have rendered your app. fix it"
needs a calendar interface. great app, a clickable calendar link would make it more user friendly. also needs the ability to edit notes on products and services.
great app. i don't understand what some people are complaining about it. this app works great. thank you
. user friendly, simple to use.
awesome app. helps with all business expenses and just great interface
. your mobile app crashed since 2508. unable to launch until today. app is still not working perfectly. unable to edit details especially product and service. keep suggesting to contact support but app complete freeze when i tapped on support.
terrible. try to do estimates on the quickbooks for ipad. it is easier to do on the quickbooks for iphone. intuit needs to get some people like myself with an office any where that using qb online very hard and heavy to beta test there software.
missing features. it would great if it could read data from receipts and auto fills the fields. i can't get my clients to use the app, because re silt entry is too cumbersome. reports are lacking.
works great. does a great job
. i like everything except when using android does not let you check history of customers if it's older than a year say. ios however does. i have android. i need to call one of my employees to check history on their phone which is silly
. for over a week, the app has been failing to load my account details. i sent the error report by email too. i am using the correct login info and i have a samsung galaxy s10 plus. the app is poorly designed and maintained... spending all the money on those commericalsads vs on the actual product, not looking to renew once our lisence expires at this rate... we can just build our own system instead or use other functioning ones..
avoid merchant service. avoid at all cost the merchant services. they preapprove you and then hold on your money for a month before forcing you to refund each transaction you processed with them. i had to call 6 times 1 hour each time and it is still not fixed. they are still holding the funds and it’s been more than a full month. terrible customer service.
. less useful than dealer version. convenient but sufficiently different from qb pro to require retraining staff. many favorite reports and easy navigation missing from qbo. constant strongarm marketing to upgrade or add features removed from qb pro (ie. payroll). very handy to permit off site accountant to review at their leisure
zero stars new version is junk. i used this app several times a day. i run my business on this app. since april 10th i cannot access my data. my business is suffering and intuit cannot fix it. i still have to pay. tech support at intuit  quickbooks recommended i switch to a android. (i doesn't work on my iphone or ipad) i really do not want to invest in new hardware. stay away from intuit they do not care and offer no solutions.
great app. this has transformed my business. it is so easy to use that i now do my accounting on my cell phone.
"rarely works. the quickbooks app worked great for awhile. now with the last update, nothing refreshes. i'm always receiving messages that it can't ""update at this time. try again later."" very disappointing"
the best for small biz. to be able to login and get to your quickbooks anywhere is awesome! if you love the ability to work at different locations using dropbox because your files are where you need them, this is the same level of mobile convenience because your data is always where you need it!
. have used quickbooks online for many years and i am very happy with how easy it is to use and the email invoices are extremely professional looking.
. good app
. good app!
. very poor app, theres no place that shows you income. its all outgoings etc. it shows profits but not individual sales, it allows you to create sales receipts but thats no good for past sales. app has let me down, nothing like what you see on tv, will be using a different app from now on, warning to all do the trail first, i didnt and it cost me.
why!?!. this app and online program is insanely buggy. every time i try and open the app it takes five or six trys before it loads. once it loads i am satisfied at best with the user experience, but if my internet connection isn't a gig a second the app crashes. i wish i didn't pay for a years worth of service or i would delete it with extreme prejudice.
compatibility issue?. no problem installing it on my phone but will not install in my tablet, says it's not comoatible (both v6.0.1 marshmallow). what seems to be the problem? huge disappointment from such a well known company!
app servicer. qbo needs more reporting capacity.
great softwsre. multiple devices awesome
. error code 132.100 quickbooks doesnt even have a fix for it. customer service has no clue as to what they are doing. i like paying for software that i can't use
practical intuitive program, perfect for the novice bookkeeper. great program for those on the go with little time or experience for bookkeeping
working great. seem to be doing really well. some things are better done on desktop but for the most part can do a invoice from phone and accept payments.
. great app! use this to manage my small business finances. everything you need in one place. also accept payment directly through the app! recommend this to every business owner.
great!. continues to impress and improve on this very useful app. i use it daily for bids, invoices and expenses. the addition of the ability to record expenses and photograph receipts has made my life so much more easy. and to be able to quickly add clients, easy estimates and quick invoices and finally receive payments is unbelievable and wonderful.
works good. easy to use.. it's really easy to file expenses with this. that's all i really need a mobile accounting app for.
good app. works for me.
. the worst customer service ever. i would give them zero.
. it does, what i needed to do
excellent. i am a pro exterminator and i have been using this app since i launched my company federal bug investigators in 2012. it's features are amazing and allow me to create an invoice, charge a card on the spot and more, while out in the field or away from the office. thanks to this technology i am an elite entrepreneur.
integrated desktop platform. i wish they made a desktop software and qbo for mobile. not qbo for all.
must have for moble businesses. saves me time on each service call by pre setting all customers and inventory. i no longer have stacks of written invoices and receipts to file. keeps track of all my taxes owed for sales. reminds you of unpaid invoices.
. the image quality of attaching receipts automatically downgrades and makes everything blurry. this renders the receipt image capture completely useless.
. love this app. just wish i could create work orders
great app!. very userfriendly and easy to use!
. great app
very nice!. i love have this power in my phone! i can email invoices or print them out, all on my phone! this app is easy to learn and soooooo fast when you get used to it. there was a lot of thinking when they designed this app, wow
excelente aplicación. tengo un negocio de control de plagas y esta aplicación me a permitido realizar cotizaciones y facturas mientras estoy fuera de la oficina.
doesn’t work. app won’t open and website is unresponsive. not very impressed with the program.
paid app. app costs 8.99 a month
c'mon man. still won't let you attach items. ...... please fix!
won’t load in ios 13. need an update. ios 13 crashes. won’t load.
. not free at all.. they take your valuable information such as email and phone numbers.. then say its 30 days trial.. you will have to pay to get this apps.. many of good free accounting apps are available in play store..
app doesn't refresh with changes. the app doesn't refresh right away making it appear as though changes i have made aren't saved. however, when i get back to my computer all of my attempts to make changes like adding customer payments have been saved. for example, one time i had the same payment recorded 3 times.
best app. i wish, i was aware of this an year ago. nevertheless, loving this ....
using new app for a week more problems longer i use it. really unhappy  i am missing data and receiving error messages and my only option for assistance is to use a form. am completely disappointed in quickbooks. limited functionality! come on intuit can't do any better than this and keep up with the times i have to use a computer or laptop to get full functionality?!
. you don't need to understand double dutch accounting to use it.
. access is unreliable. i've had to reinstall several times. for the cost, this is unacceptable.
. needs the employee menu... i like this app and its convenient and all but there's no reason a simple function like the employee menu shouldn't be on it
well made basic accounting. quickbooks online has been extremely useful. i have a small contracting business, and i can record an expense in seconds, photo the receipt, create an invoice or estimate, and email these to customers. syncs instantly and automatically across multiple devices, so it's on my phone, tablet and online. the cost is tiny, and it takes care of itself  no more shoebox!
so easy!. this made things so much easier. my clients are happy with the line itemization. detailed descriptions. doesn't get much better than this.
why???. for the love of gawd, why can i not add a delayed charge on the mobile app?????? this is something you actually want to do when you're at a client, not get them to sign for an invoice every time you visit them during the month.
crashes with ios 13. just a heads up. when you try to take a picture of a receipt to upload to the account, the app freezes up and you can’t continue on. restarting the app doesn’t work either.
great app! great company!. in a sea of many companies like intuit, i am honored to work with them. the ease of use and professionalism are a great plus. all the stars fully deserved!
not an intuitive product. i'm very disappointed with this product. i've used quickbooks on my laptop for two years as well as the gopayment app. this has been extremely frustrating to setup and use for both my accountant and myself.
. loved it, but acting up again. when i add something to an invoice (on s8) then hit done, the refreshed invoice lines are all out of order and duplicated. uninstalled and reinstalled, still doing it. not working on tablet either. please fix asap.
session expired loop. every time i log in i get a session expired message and logs me out. app is not usable.
great as an assistant to the desktop version.. i've found this app to be a great mobile partner to the full desktop (or online) version. there's a couple functions that aren't available in the app but everything you do need is easily available. i can't connect my bank account because my (non us) bank isn't listed but being able to input expenses as they happen is a great way of keeping updated accounts. reconciliation is a breeze afterwards. it's a great app.
movement through fields. i love the app but it takes so much more time than through safari, enter or tab should move through fields looking forward to this fix
please fix!!. i have used this app for the last few years for my business and have loved it. this latest update has made the app virtually unusable. it won't let me save an invoice, doesn't show payments made, makes me sign in every time even though i have a pin and the list goes on. very disappointed and hoping this is fixed soon.
. app isn't working, its getting crashed everytime i try to login
few useful features for me. most of the main features i need aren’t in the app. lots of features i never use are in the app. no bill payment, no upcoming bills showing up in checking register like it does on mine. no credit memos.
phone number. i like the app. i can use it for my business plan. but when im entering my phone number to create my account, it says invalid. please fix. country: philippines
love the app, but price is too high. i love the app, but when will the price increases stop. as soon as i have time to research other programs i will cancel my subscription. $40 per month is too much to just invoice customers and reconcile my bank statement.
small business asset. easy way to keep track off all those expenses, invoices, payments etc for a small business owner with little time to spend on administrative stuff.
limited. not much functionality compared with the desktop app, frustrating. unable to access banking or create bills.
. the online version aaks you to download the app, which doesnt do half the stuff the online version can do. 🤷
phone. phone app is better than pc version
don't bug me for reviews. the title says it
. great app
. good app!
. great app!!
love it!. we've used qb for about a decade, and looove the new app. makes life easier!!
good app. helps me keep my books up to date.
. i can't remove the date from my columns on a quote. several days and still no reply from your support team. extremely poor. if you wish to cater to businesses then you need better support. i emailed and posted but no reply. i have quotes overdue and am losing customers. i want this product but not if there is no support.
. good app perfect
awesome app!. started my business with the start of this app since i'm a mobile mechanic and it's awesome to do quotes and invoices on the fly makes it easier to keep customers
useless. invoices won't save please fix
. the support is terrific
can’t subscribe after trial period. it’s a good quickbooks version but i started trial period made a profile and invoices but the app won’t let me renew subscription the buy now button doesn’t work when clicked on. now i may have to start another profile and lose everything?
. i love it ...just wish i could personalize information fields on the invoices to accommodate the type of work we do mobile mechanics add fields for vehicle # vin # license plate and mileage would be awesome
. no problems for me. works great
i need support no one available. i need support trying to do payroll but no one at qb is available. not a very good way to run this business!
. am loving it makes my life so much easier
great app. let's me keep up with things while i am on the go.
. can't print invoices should have a print invoices if on home network
india is not mentioned. sorry to say that but i uninstalled the app in 3mins because india as a nation is not mentioned.
save so much time. love this app. now i can review customer history in the field, and even get some of my bookkeeping done wherever i am. its fast, has options i need, and fits in my pocket.
down graded. i down graded to qb online. it appears it was released about a year too soon. nothing but frustration from day one. the phone app is all but useless.
. just awful. i never know if or when it will work properly. i've uninstalled and reinstalled, tried with and without wifi, this app has cost me a lot in time and money. i never know what it will screw up next and support has never once been helpful in solving issues
great app. works well for small to medium size businesses on the go!
fmtt. i like quickbooks especially the app. however, reconciliation is difficult and confusing. also, matching. deposits and making sure deposits are made in quickbooks is so hard to figure out.
exactly what i need. the app combined with the online system does exactly what i need it to do. i can invoice clients as soon as i've left their premises, no more trying to keep a record and doing the paperwork later. invoice matching and bank data feeds make reconciliation so easy. this has reduced the amount of time i spend on my accounts significantly. goodbye sage, hello qb online. happy customer.
. i like this app so easy to use i recommend
. it makes creating estimates simpler. i used to fumble my way thru, now it's simple and fun!
useless app. almost no features. not worth using.
great app. love the details and ability to invoice or add customers on the go!
easiest accounting on the go. makes it so easy for me to handle income and expenses for my business no matter where i am.
freezes all the time. it will kick me out several times in a session and it freezes up and doesn't save the work that i have done. not very user friendly for newcomers.
update needed. for the past three weeks has not been tracking the miles. otherwise a 5 star app when working properly.
. great app. i have enjoyed learning on the uses for it. my only complaint would be the overall price i pay for everything. i feel like i get nickle and dimed on things i feel like should come with my monthly fee. with that being said i still plan on using this since it works very well and it has overall saved me time.
was great and then they updated it. i loved this app when i first got it. i used it all the time for 5 months strait, and then they 'updated' it. now, it's awful. i don't see any of the new features and it is buggy beyond belief. please go back to the older version. this is a joke.
new update 115. the new update is horrible!! i used to be able to search customers by address and the search bar is gone. also, whatever screen i choose to be in, i have to fully close the app out to go back! what happened?!?!
. really great app, highly recommend it!
. the app has finally grown up. intuit is doing a much better job of listening to the customer.
great app. absolutely helpful and useful
. unworkable garbage. sso doesn't work. can't sign in with otherwise working credentials. leaves orphaned chrome instances running for every failed signon. absolute trash; fire these developers.
upholstery shop. very good app, help me a lot at upholstery business!
. quickbooks banking is my favorite part of the app, because it's easy you catergorise all your expenses and incomes. the dashboard shows an overview of your financial situation.
great app. been with quickbooks for two years now and still really impressed very easy to use and works across all platforms would strongly recommend
great app. only thing i don’t like is if you accidentally delete an invoice you can never get that invoice number back and it’s now been voided. that needs to be fixed so it can be adjusted or recovered. none the less it’s a great app. won’t ever connect my bank info none the less because that’s how you get audited for nothing.
great app!. i love the flexibility of having my company info at all times.
. your log in process is pathetic. its always asking me to verify and that process takes over an hour most of the time as it keeps resetting to the main log in screen. if you can't fix this i'll cancel my subscription
. great app! let's me keep up with my business on the fly!
love it. great software when teamed up with abdroid app
superb app. i'm an electrician and run my entire business on this app it's makes my life so easy :)
rubbish. doesn't work. need to add bills but can't. how ridiculous to not have this function. deleted. no support from customer service
. awesome app
. preparing to start a business and this software was rated the best. i took a 5 day class for 4hours. i was so happy that i downloaded this app and used in class too.
please stop making my sign in. every other fingerprint authentication app on my phone (banking, password manager, file managers) does not nag me to log in via password every other day. why does this app do so? please fix.
great program. i find myself keeping better records. very user friendly. great program
awesome. love being able to bill and email from my phone.. great app
no bills. has great functions except cannot enter billsinvoices from vendors.
makes it easy. quickbooks has done nothing but make my life as a new business owner a breeze. i can expense purchases, write up invoices and so much more right from my phone when i'm out of the office it's amazing. i don't know where i would be without quickbooks
awesome app, love quickbooks. use it often to add expenses and check bank data. nice feature of receipt photo, works great
quickbooks online on macbook. quickbooks online is constantly crashing while i'm creating my invoices. every time i enter a line entry i have to take the extra time to save it because the program will freeze up and i will have to force quit and restart the whole invoice over again. i rate it a 1 star only because i can't rate it any lower.
it's good but could use something. i really liked the ipad app since i could see more. since many androids have larger screens something similar would be nice.
nice app!. i live on my device  from research to book keeping. elegant style and useful! i can do almost everything from my note 2! light years beyond the old quick books that i used 10 years ago! i'm sending invoices in minutes. awesome! update: still a great app on my nexus 6!
. i love this new app
. great app, doesn't crash and still much to learn from it bur its helping keep my business organized
. error message when i try to log in on my tablet. customer service offers little assistance after a long time on hold. this experience makes accounting for my small business even more unbearable. (update 11418): i dropped the review down to one star (from 2) because the error message is yet to be resolved on my tablet, three months later, and qb has increased the cost of their simple start plan by 30%. lame.
easy to use and great features. i moved to quickbooks after trying xero, and find it at least as good for my needs and much better value. good foreign currency support, which is important for me.
crashes a ton. this is a great app for bookkeeping for my business, but it crashes almost daily on my iphone. please get better engineers for the functionality of this app!! so frustrating when i’m in the middle of printing invoices and the app crashes! how am i supposed to conduct business that way!?!
. best app for bussiness by far!
powerful mobile app!. love this app and use it all the time while on the go.
awesome, powerful app. we've been using quickbooks for years, this app allows us to take all our bookkeeping at our finger tips
email is my only complaint i don't like my emails coming from into it i want to choose my own email so my customers can respond please fix this. respond it's when i'm sending invoices or estimates
very nice!. i love have this power in my phone! i can email invoices or print them out, all on my phone! this app is easy to learn and soooooo fast when you get used to it. there was a lot of thinking when they designed this app, wow
. very impressed with this userfriendly app!
electrician. most important tool of my business.
beautiful app, curious about next features.. the revamped qb online is really attractive. still people coming from the classic qb are missing features. qb uses a great system to allow customers to vote for features. the success of the online version will depend on how fast qb development will be able to produce the big wishlist of new features.
. unfortunately it crashes when i log in on my samsung tab a
switching between account requires logout and login. so annoying, especially since there is no support for touch id. why can't you let us switch from within the app?
. can't get any email response from quickbooks. bad customer service. i want to download my account transactions but no reply from quickbooks.
great app. i have been using it and it is good. though i wish more features were added for suppliers.
lacks important functionality. this app doesn’t let you see current bank balances for any account, which is a major oversight. intuit: please add this feature.
this is a total disaster. quickbooks online is a complete and total mess. my invoices are duplicating themselves in the register, the register isn't adding correctly, and my sales tax isn't correct so it has to be done by hand. when you call customer service, they have no answers and never bother to return your call because nobody there knows how to fix the issues. i would recommend that nobody ever uses quickbooks online.
slow books. can’t accept transactions in banking section. sluggish app, end up using the computer more often.
security update  unable to sign in. since the security update for sign in features i'm unable to sign into my account using the app.. defeats the purpose of having it aug 23, 2016  just redownloaded the app and have full access once again. oct 20, 2016  unable to select cash, check or credit account to pay an expense.
after the update. before the latest update i never used the app as i have to attach signed work orders. now? it's awesome!
. quickbooks accounting app is convenient an easy to navigate.
fantastic features. all the features that works under this single app. i used to work with excel spreadsheet, invoice app, expense app to complete the business on the go. now everything has being simplify into this one subscription saving me time and double entry. i am absolutely happy that i can email invoice, take pictures and enter expense using my iphone. best of all these is update into the cloud. great excellent accounting software nothing comes close after trying others accounting software.
. useful!
. it's not perfect yet, but does what i need invoices and sales receipts in the field that i can print with my mobile printer. the recording part isn't as good as my desktop version but i know with time it will be improved.
. while this app has a couple of problems, the benefits far outweigh the negatives. i would recommend it to anyone in business
. app won't upload my bank transactions. how do i add revenue?
. app wont log in to my samsung phone, tried a number of different things including deleting data and cache as well as uninstallinstalling it. i know my account is fine because it works on my apple phonecomputer with no issues. please help!
subscription renewal poorly thought out. i have been using qbonline for more than a year. it picked the worst time to time out and demand a subscription renewal. further it requires multiple logins and you must be st your desk top. nothing more frustrating than what amounts to a software crash when you are trying to get things done. huge fail quickbooks
suits me. so easy to use, perfect for my tiny business. don't need accounting skills the workflow has been designed very well and support is great.
. i operate two companies through the app and notice that suppliers and customers from one company end up being listed in the other! i would give more stars, but this is a glaring issue that needs resolving urgently.
. works very well for how i use the app within my business.
love it!!!. this app makes things so easy to keep track of a job while in the field and saves time. love it!!!!
. great app. no problems
. user friendly for the droid not so much in the appleipad.
really wish it was hipaa compliant. i have a healthcare related company. my billing process would be a lot easier and faster if i could send invoices through my secure network or if qbo was hipaa compliant.
bugs & functions. fair but still a lot of bugs with tablets. mis more functions like crm programs. and would nice to have more control clients groups, commissions, as well as price list, like ,distributions, whole sale, or final client...
errors. why you never check your app before you launch it online so many errors no touch id when signing no latest activities update receive payment not working and this just 5 min of use
. great app
works great. works great for my small business. not sure why there are bad reviews, qbo keeps up with my customers information, invoices, and estimates. very easy to use. now on this last update, i did have to uninstall and reinstall on my andriod phone, but within 5 minutes i was back up and running.
. this app constantly signs itself out. it takes forever to load. quickbooks online has been a mistake from the start but i'm vested. its going to be difficult to change but i'm going to find someone else. the iphone app sucks worse.
worst customer service. i love the idea of the app but it’s too confusing i don’t get a lot of the options and customer service i barely understood anything was no help at all. i just simply needed the app to track incomeexpense and personal pay.
. the app is not updating on my phone
quickbooks online. this apps rocks!
. great ape i like it i can manage my customers from anywhere,good ape
incredibly glitchy. the app is glitchy despite updates. i’m not super impressed by intuit in general. i use their payroll for my business, a lot of glitches there too. app crashes or spontaneously exits my selections to “accept” for no reason and i have to start over. does not learn well, i have to reteach things over and over.
. great app, but not as functional as desktop version.
wonderful app for freelancers. likes: stores repeat client info  allows for cc payment  allows me to include my company logo and information on each invoice.  alerts me of tardy invoices  provides me with easy to read charts and measure each months incomeexpenses dislikes:  credit card payments incurs a hefty fee rather than a monthly charge  all of my invoices have an intuit logo  customer service is not great
would get 5 stars if it refreshed properly.. every time i open the app, i need to log out then log back in in order to get updated content. please can this get fixed.
disappointed. do not download this app. i'm sorry i did. extremely flawed.
fantastic software !. currently in a middle of a building site, sending clients invoice & estimates. now my time is my own this evening ! couldn’t do with out it .
great app. very helpful! good to go!
tons of bugs and glitches. there are lots of glitches and lack of features in this app. the vendor transaction history is spotty, many vendors and missing history all together. profit and loss report doesn’t scroll. can’t see the true checkbook register of checks that are written out but haven’t yet cleared. it’s really not very good.
great tool!. does everything i need for a small business in a convenient format.
awesome app. quick books is really an awesome app. links up to accounts quickbooks payments. i can access from all my devices. it’s really versatile. you can make great estimates as well. emailed invoices and estimates look very professional.
"latest upgrade is a disgrace. i have never written a negative review of an upgrade, but the latest version of this app made a great app totally useless. you can no longer receive invoices or reconcile bank balances. do yourself a favor and delete the quickbooks app rather than ""upgrade."" the mobile website is more useful than the app."
works good but. haven't been able to email invoices for over 2 months now.. what's up wit that??
. good reliable app
great app. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😊😊
entering bills?????. why have intuit decided not to support bill entering on this app?!? it great i can import my paper receipts using the camera, but whats the point if i can't enter as a bill only an expense?!?
simple and beatiful. i'm a happy paying customer. the ui can certainly be improved but it is simply the best of it's class at the moment. the ready customization for malaysia gst and online integration with malaysian banks are awesome. i love the modern look of the web and mobile web version while their competitors are still stuck with ui from late 90s and early 2000.
packing slip. please add option to print packing slip from the app
brilliant app. makes running a business a lot easier.
great complement to quickbooks online. not the full program, but it makes it easy to keep up to date with expenses on the fly.
so easy. this app makes it so easy to print invoices for my clients on the go! also cuts down on time that i have to sit at my desk at home and allows more time with family. great app.
. quickbooks banking is my favorite part of the app, because it's easy you catergorise all your expenses and incomes. the dashboard shows an overview of your financial situation.
. the app format doesn't reflect the desktop format menu  confusing for the user. also, the sales  invoice page is different to desktop, with not the same information when shown side by side. the app needs a bitbof work.
sweet & sour. been using for a month or so, very pleased on being able to do my bookkeeping on the go..... but!! disappointed on not being able to have balances on checking or savings accounts unless you get back to a computer. please add this feature.
. doesn't do what the advertisements say it does. and the app has so many bugs on my new pixel it's not worth it.
. great app for business
quickbooks online. this app has been very helpful for me a small business owner. however the new update has been very frustrating for me as it automatically signs you out and the home page shows your gross income. i wish there was a way to make it private.
easy to use and quick customer service. love this app for my business. makes it easy to keep everything up to date and keeps the books accurate. i recommend it to every business!!
what a joke!. quick books “backing you” is their slogan, should be backing themselves. only want your data and money. the so called “free trial is another scam.
great but unreliable. a five star app with one star reliability. half the time it doesn't refresh, or your data is unaccessible, or the server can't be contacted, or you are logged out. when working it is fantastic, but the most infuriating app for business i have ever used.
add items?. there's no where to add items, only when i make an invoice it let's you add items, but there's no items list so you can quickly choose from lists, so every time i make an invoice i have to add an item manually instead of choosing from a list?
returning to qb. uk staff still rude and unhelpful.
finally organized. this program has allowed me work on net 15 and 30... without worry of payments. also freed up estimating time. thanks
. dont bother if you dont have access to pc or laptop.basic features like editing customer email is not available on mobile devices including tablets.if an invoice isnt sent because the recipient email address sends it back,you have no way of knowing that an error has occurred even when attempting to check via any web browser.caused me £1000's of cashflow headache. contacted customer support,got a nonsensical response.made it sound like the problem is an actual feature of the app and software.
features bugged and gets worse every time they update it. transactions page on ios 13 doesn’t respond atall, you can categorise and transactions or match payments. stop updating the app when you haven’t tested it thoroughly... it’s getting to the point i’m going to start looking elsewhere.
app login. i can not login to app using my online login details. have reset again and again and nothing works. very frustrating
. love the app! everything i need, when i need it!
"buggy, issues with sync. for some reason this app is constantly having connection issues for me. i get messages like ""transaction not accepted"". then i have to log into the desktop version to actually do the work. ok for a glance but not useful for productivity."
inferior to qb online on desktop. qb app on ipad or android does not not have even half of the features that qb online has on a desktop. i can manage basic invoicing, basic expenses, see transactions, and pull up basic reports... everything about this app is basic. i have to actually be on my desktop to access the full features of qb online. very dissapointed.
. best accounting app.
disaster. was forced to use qb online due to always changing fees for desktop version. always crashes. hard to use. terrible. wish i could use another program. new version has new colours!! yay so practical!! doesn’t accommodate qc payroll deductions like cssnt but that’s ok, it’s colourful. intuit idiots.
great but could be greater. easy to use book work became so much easier with quick books online the only thing that i don't like is that you should be able to do everything across all platforms: ipad,iphone,laptop
. horrible, spent 2 hours trying to cancel subscription. they don't have the cancel button. called them...45 min wait. terrible service.
. easy to use. the only reason i did give it five stars was because you can't add custom fields to the customer data.
spotty & unreliable. i rarely review any apps that i use unless they are particularly great or particularly terrible. in this case, sadly it is the latter. this app doesn't have basic features that should be included, and about half of my invoices i cannot open from the app because apparently it uses some feature in their api that is nonsupported or not working. regardless, if you are looking for a 21stcentury accounting solution and app this is sadly not it at all.
useless after update. quickbooks was wonderful until the most recent update rendered it useless. things won't save. transactions hang up. very frustrating.
. quickbooks have never let me down. this app is great to manage my business.
. great app friendly to use can create receipts on the spot. i am a mobile repair service and i run all my sales thru this app.
. i've been using this for my business for 5 years. i love it because i csn do it on my phone through the app and desktop! it is also easy to collect and sibmitt all my tax info at tax time. works for me, easy to learn, and reliable.
bank sync. errors while synching bank accounts for matching invoices. this is a basic function and not sure why they cant fix it. account shows as not deposited though its in bank. please fix this.
. i travel for work and this app is awesome. i can write and email estimates, invoices, and recieve payments on the fly. it makes my life way easier.
". you broke the app!!! can't attach pdfs to invoices anymore!!! it litteraly worked yesterday, and today a ""new"" interface. make a deal with adobe and fix it now!!!"
linked bank account. locked out. no customer service.. there is literally no phone support whatsoever for the mobile app. i'm still locked out of this app after linking my checking account.
. i messaged support about my subscription it was not what i wanted. i cancelled the account last month and was still billed and on the subscription. would like a refund on my card
. i just wanto cancel my trial before march 5th 2019
comments. there is no printing options for mobile printing. we have tu use other app, to print invoices. poor in reports not friendly to do invoices
"buggy, issues with sync. for some reason this app is constantly having connection issues for me. i get messages like ""transaction not accepted"". then i have to log into the desktop version to actually do the work. ok for a glance but not useful for productivity."
loss of functionality. i had been using this app for a while without any real issues. however, recently the 'expense' button that pulls up from the '+' menu on the home screen is grayed out...thus rendering the app fairly useless on the go! intuit said they unfortunately didn't have the ability to fix issues with the app.
. love it. recommended by a friend makes life easy. my team in the office can create an invoice and i just fill in the blanks get customer to sign when job is complete and sent before leaving site.
. excelente app para llevar las finanzas del negocio.
nice but buggy. first i'd like to thank you for a great app that makes my business easy on the go! needs some attention but on my s5 it doesn't appear in the multitask list and my friends iphone has the ability to match bank feeds also which is missing on my android?
great!. the ipad qb app works great! as a plus the support and development people are very respectful and helpful when it comes to suggestions to make the app even better. to be able to be completely mobile for a small business means you can be more efficient and get paid faster. the only thing the app is lacking is signature capture and then it will be everything you need and there will be no need for apps like invoiceasap.
great update to already great app. the latest update is great! being able to reconcile through app is awesome. best accounting app out!!!
great but how do i renew?. it says i need to renew or pay? i hit ok and try to go to the spot i need to but don't see anything. smthis happened while trying to make someone a receipt in person.
. still in trial, but so far so good... very pleased with overall functionality! trial over, five years later... upgraded to 5 stars. perfect app for my small business. does what i need, always available, improves the client experience.
perfect for my small business. i am a wedding photographer and quickbooks online is the best way for me to keep track of my expensesrentals and write up a quick invoice or estimate while i am on the road. i absolutely love how user friendly it is. as long as i have my smart phone i can work from anywhere.
incredibly glitchy. the app is glitchy despite updates. i’m not super impressed by intuit in general. i use their payroll for my business, a lot of glitches there too. app crashes or spontaneously exits my selections to “accept” for no reason and i have to start over. does not learn well, i have to reteach things over and over.
. actually very important app for business and its very easy to handle good app.
sorely disappointed. intuit made good products maybe even great products at one time. now their cloud offerings a just released with out any concern for features and bugs. disappointed. somebody has gotten to big to care about their customers.
. love this app!
instant customer service 👌. great app for small to mid size business. phenomenal integration from windows 10. so far so good. thanks.
". getting this message for the last 3 days on my android. ""there was a problem syncing your data. wait a few minutes and try again"". please fix this edit: i have done all those steps, cleared cache, uninstalled, reinstalled, gave all permissions, even did a full factory reset on the phone and still same issue.."
. limited in what the app can do...
. won't update data. data is 137 days old and counting. refreshes don't help and uninstallingreinstalling is a waste of time. thanks for nothing.
update is buggy. the latest update won't save invoices correctly and doesn't pull up all my clients names. i hope it's fixed soon i use it daily. also won't allow touch id or pin sign in!
loveland ohio small business owner. love quickbooks. new users starting july 2012. it has helped keep things organized and if i mess up or question, which i have, their help people are awesome in working with me to explain or even help me undo my errors. kudos to the team trainers who trained the team and kudos to the team's who are patient with us on the phone calls!!!!
great app. an amazing application for small business owners. a personal accountant only for 700 egy a month + you learn accounting
. very handy for on the go small business tasks
love it!. so far the app is easy to navigate and i like using it.
. awesome app
. excellent app
down graded. from april this app is unusable. i down graded to qb online. it appears it was released about a year too soon. nothing but frustration from day one. the phone app is all but useless.
works great. works great for my small business. not sure why there are bad reviews, qbo keeps up with my customers information, invoices, and estimates. very easy to use. now on this last update, i did have to uninstall and reinstall on my andriod phone, but within 5 minutes i was back up and running.
. the updating is slow and i have to manually refresh before changes show up.
". loving being able to access and invoice on the go! can be slow but so can online. entering invoices on phone i have to hide the keyboard to go to next field  be good to have ""next"" button."
awesome. this app is perfect for all users. i haven't found an instance where this app can not be used. it lets the boss and employee work together from anywhere. it can only get better with time. if u need an invoice or quote program. this is your app. (+more). a lot less paper work that's for sure. 😉
great app if it worked.. this app was really promising at first, but now it seems like i consistently have issues with chase bank accounts and american express accounts updating. it’s monday and sine thursday my alchase accounts say they are updated when they are not and my amex continuously has error connections. and then u call customer service and they ask you if you called amex to see why there was a connection problem. a shame.
. nothing ever works on the app can't create invoicescant add products it's useless
. after upgrading to lg g6 the app no longer works. can't even get it to load. reinstalled, rebooted still nothing.
lacking compared to ios version. the layout and functionality compared to the ipad version is horrible and hard to use. plus there is no way for the customer to sign for invoice or estimate on tablet or phone. i am an android fan all the way, but i am going to have to purchase an ipad to get the functionality i need. i am very disappointed.
great app. quickbooks online is great with the addition of this app to keep track of your business finances
. downloaded app twice when i tried to login error message continually read i didn't have a quickbooks subscription. was never allowed to access app features.
best thing i did for my business. very easy to learn and work with. now i can make invoices on my phone, tablet or computer and get paid fast. plus it is easy to pay employees and keep track
like the app. just hope it would be easier to use need better access to my custumers invoice and estimates
. simple and professional.
. very unreliable. get frequent errors trying to edit expenses. ui is clunky and errors all over the place. i don't trust the numbers on the expenses either. actually, the expenses are completely wrong. literally doubled versus the website. what a joke.
great can scan bills directly with phone. i use phone app instead of pc sometimes, as i can record bill right when i make purchase, complete with scan on receipt. awesome.
awful app, won't open. app was working fine until a few days ago. reinstalling doesn't fix it. app opens and a second later disappears. not good for people trying to do their accounts.
kerry pabian. are you kidding me !!! app is crashing on my ipad since the update ! why do you always do updates right before its time to do billing ?
". does not sync to account. on the home screen it shows i have invoices that are overdue from customers, but when you click on it, it says ""congratulations, no overdue invoices."" useless app"
terrible billing system. i had an email offer for 75% off, tried to get it on my desktop. ended up subscribing for $10mth only to find out it closed my trial account, created a new account, now i have to cancel,subscribe on the ipad for $25mth and my data is not updating now....run away from this fast....
. great app, makes my life much easier!!
stuck in data download. can't open app on ipad or iphone. stuck in a data download loop. support says there are no known issues, what a joke.
love it. just be cautious when trying 30 free trail. i loaded half a dozen customers and lots of estimates,invoices etc. and then purchased the 6 month subscription after i got familiar with software. well it led to doing work twice. because you can only have one or the other, free trail discounted 6 months subscription.
fantastic app. allencompassing and very user friendly
. love it!!! works great with the online site, as a business owner this app is very useful.
. doesn't really do much in the big quickbooks picture
great job. great app! great for my graphic design business!
. user friendly
easy and efficient!. the app serves perfectly to capture transactions on the go, snap a pic and enter amount and accounts then review later if needed on a computer. simple, some people expect this to be fully functional for some reason; if you need a fully functional program then you really should have the appropriate expenses towards computers and software anyways. this app makes the book keeping process easy as cake for clients and the accountant.
great !!. has made running my business so much easier !
small business accounting. very helpful software for my business. has everything from accounting software to expenses, to employee payroll and deductions. has helped me become more efficient with my time. makes estimating and invoicing more streamline.
stops unexpectedly. i can never really depend on this app because it shuts down unexpectedly. i can't really get anything done on the mobile app.
. será que me pueden ayudar, no puedo hacer ningún tipo de registro en el sistema. envié un correo y nadie me ha respondido
no pos. doesn't allow you to create pos. takes out functionality available on the full online version.
great app so far. great app. one thing needed i’d making it easier to change customers info when doing a new invoice for a previous customer but at a new address.
"don't download latest version!!. software was great before the latest update. now, no more touchid support, no ability to email invoices. we all remember what apple did with the maps mess, i wonder if intuit will have the testicular fortitude to ""can"" the person who attempted to update the already good software?"
. solid a love the mobility and ease of use for my small business. just wish i could void or cancel invoices and estimates on the app.
can't live without it. i don't know how i did business before this app. i love that i can access my company books anywhere. i love the way i can take a photo of the receipts for my expenses. thank you qb!
. awful, just awful. will log me in then never actually connects to my qb account. utter crap. make a product that works before advertising it on tv.
good app. needs improvements as its a little tricky to use. and doesn't allow much access. but overall okay
. easy tp learn and use
"quick books is the bombdiggity!! ya heard!. as a small business owner it saves me time, click, picture of the receipt, click and the expense is logged in real live time. no more saving piles and piles of receipts. it also pin point tracks your expenditures. it's the ""bombdiggity""!"
employees. was charge $30 for three months for payroll, which i was not using. called the payroll department and they took care of me: refunded the cash into my account without question.
excellent. does what it says on the tin.. excellent app. works brilliantly on the ipad, sometimes find it a little sluggish on the iphone but i put that down to the poor wifi we sometimes have and bad signal from phone operator. anyways it's so easy to use and i can produce an invoice there and then and email to the client instantly. don't know why i took so long to move from desktop to quickbooks online.
. not enough to complain! what app let's you try it for free and actually works every time. i can't wait to buy it for all the years to come and use it more than i already do
mobile features. while i like that it allows me access on the go not all features are available as if you were on a desktop. still, great app very useful on the go.
. it does everything i need it to, customer service is really helpful when you're learning how to use it, and the convenience of accessing your books anywhere anytime is exactly what a busy person needs.
very good mobile app. i use this on my computer and when i noticed that there was an app for android, i immediately installed it on my tablet and phone. a must have if you have a mobile business or have to give invoices on the go.
makes accounting a breeze. this app is great. link it to your account and it quickly learns how to categorize your expenses. then all you have to do is confirm or adjust as needed. 👍👍
poor experience. the app is extremely buggy, unstable, and very slow. logging into the app is unpredictable and i'm randomly logged out. entering receipts is quite painful to say the least, and is impossible without a decent internet connection.
issues with addresses being in window of envelope. i used to be able to print off invoices and mail them to customers by folding in thirds. now i have to fold a special way to get the address to appear in the windows of the envelope.
convenience. i really love the convenience and accessibility of this app and quickbooks online. since switching from desktop pro to this i've been able to keep up with paperwork in the field. i think it's great. i just wish they made an upgrade so i could automatically subtract expenses from specific jobs. having everything separate is a real hassle.
. am happy that it allows me to.make estimates from my mobile phone
. would be great if you could actually see activity on vendors or customers instead of just there profile. have had this app for 3 years now and has never fully synced only pulls up a quarter of the information that you see online.
qb intuit online app. fantastic program highly recommend 👍😀
very nice!. i love have this power in my phone! i can email invoices or print them out, all on my phone! this app is easy to learn and soooooo fast when you get used to it. there was a lot of thinking when they designed this app, wow
great app!. i was using quickbooks pro desktop 2013 before going to online 2016. all i can say is wow! i never realized how much i was missing. reconciling expenses with automatic bank and credit card transaction downloads can be done on my phone anywhere and anytime. no need to log into bank and manually download. huge time saver. also keeps me up to date on my finances with great reporting built in and at my fingertips.
. really frustrated, do not buy this app through google, once you setup you account through good you can not upgrade you account or transfer it to a regular subscription. so i'm just stuck with what i have....
easy!!!. quickbooks makes running your own business easy! user friendly!
crashing all the time. i know it's version 1.0, but still. it's crashing left, right and center all the time. you may want to wait 68 months before this app is stable.
mr. doesn't work on ipad pro or iphone. it says my subscription has expired. i have had it for several years and it still works on macbook but on ios it thinks i am on a free trial until 13th april but still locks me out saying i need to update my subscription. it is useless to me if it won,t work on ipad because i photograph all my receipts into the app. will cancel subscription if it doesn't work soon.
very limited. i like quickbooks, but the ipad application is very limited on its ability to work compared to the website and the desktop application they offer. it needs a lot of improvement since the ipad can handle the workload.
crashes now. i got a new iphone updated it and installed quickbooks and it crashes every time i sign in.
experience getting worse. entering transaction requires way too many taps. it isn’t location aware to suggest transactions you just always search. recent updates have some bug that makes the app download the data file with almost every login and login often you must. usually twice a week it loses my password. i have enjoyed quickbooks online but this app experience may have me evaluating competitors in december.
***** updated latest.. very useful.
. compared with the apple version, the android version scrolling doesn't work
great but i need.... to be able to apply discountsclient credits when creating an invoice on the app. add that and it will be perfect. for some reason the code doesn't allow for negative numbers when creating invoices in app, but on the computer it works just fine. thanks!
shady. very easily hacked and an unsafe server. average waiting time for customer service on the phone is hour. you will be transferred at least 2 to 3 times, hopefully you can get somebody who speaks english.
. great app, simple to use, alot of resources.
30 days trial. need to pay after 30 days
user friendly. this app is simple to use, easy to grasp, and professional in presentation.
. it's great to send invoices and estimates through email from my phone
great for billing while traveling. this app is very hearty. i was worried how it would work from the ipad but it was so easy. let's me bill while i'm on the road so that i can keep my cash flow in order. great job, inuit!
app not working on iphone. i’ve been trying to install the app on my iphone (6s) with the current version of ios for the past couple of months. the app downloads and installs. when i tap the app to open it, the screen briefly shows the intuit quickbooks logo and then closes. i called support but the told me to go to apple. the ability to use the app to capture receipts etc was a big draw to using quickbooks online. very disappointed.
. this app makes my life so much easier
overall but problems. overall works well for small business. a lot of problems with checking account and credit card connections. one i am still going to have to sort through to make sure transactions weren't missed, as it only loads back 90 days. and you get no notification if an account suddenly disconnects. its a mess but customer service is good and they work with you well.
. the app does not work on any android tablet. works on my android phone but, not on any of my four tablets. will be cancelling our subscription if not fixed soon.
statements. can't send statements or use bundles in the app. email customer services about it and they send you a email about doing it on your desk top. been asking for 6 months to have it added to the app. just get the same response while they add useless gimmicks to the app.
. how do i unsubscribe
. didn't login in for a couple weeks, and they removed all of my account data. worthless.
. fantastic and very simple to use
. worst ever customer support and fulo bunch of non professional people. not at all recommended.
. i can not accomplish anything in the app, a blank screen comes up no matter what category i try to go to.
bitch ur fucked. all over culiacan and the net
my expectations of quick books.. i would expect the quick books would gave been able to give me a complete overview of my accounts and businesses. e.g. i can't find anywhere in the program where i can print my company's balance sheet or my company's profit and loss accounts, to name a few. why is this so?
great business program. great program and user friendly! dont like that get charged everytime payments recieved online it becomes very costly as it adds up think this is wrong and hard enough on a business owner but overall best program to run small business or any business
. app is crashing. also, when it does log in successfully, it doesn't remember my state from previous login. it needs to downloads stacks of data all over again.
getting too flaky. i’ve been a subscriber for about 2 years now but am now randomly getting locked out of the app where it thinks i don’t have a subscription! i’ve reported the issue , it always gets resolved but then returns ! went to do my accounts and quotes this weekend and guess what .... i’m locked out ... again! is that acceptable for a business app ! definitely not.
. everything i need. just wish they'd include mileage tracking.
". generally very good, one problem when sending invoices it says ""invoice number"" as opposed to saying actual invoice #. not an issue if sending from pc."
. simple to use and good value. love the app!
needs improvement. the bottom line is its a half attempt at a usable app the key features such as updating and access to registers don't work and the work around snare to tedious
not bad. i like it. quickly to make and send invoices. the worst problem is not possible to transfer data
great. helps me track all of my business needs from estimates and invoicing to financing. great app!
it's broke :(. wonderful app, latest update has caused many issues, including signing in with fingerprint or app code. have to do a full sign in each time with email and loooooong password. hope they can fix soon! 😩😖😤
simply slow. i talked to 300 people and they all say it’s just the program itself
great. efficient. user friendly.. really enjoying having this app option for my business. absolutely loving quickbooks intuit online!! really like it can upload photos of receipts. my only suggestion would be to allow photos to be upload to an itemized bill. thank you.
"error. i dont even understand why massage always popup said ""failed to connect with server"" when everytime tried to login using this app..send several of email to support team but theres no answer n solution..please do something i am a quickbooks online plus subscriber.."
refund made impossible. i’ve been making payment on this stupid app not using it at all. there’s no easy way to refund or unsubscribe this stupid app. who do i bring the attention to since quickbook site says they have nothing to do with the billing and subscription?
. does what i need when i don't have computer access.
. i didn't worry about computer crash losing all my data plus it goes with me everywhere. but the app does not work right now. 7 weeks & no feed back
business owner. this app has all the features i need to run a small but quickly growing business. easy to navigate.
. it works well for me so far. i have a lot more to learn
very convenient, its great access. could be more useful if advanced features allowed access to edit more, like editing products
works well but need enhancements. the app works well and easy to use. i will appreciate if it can be enhanced to accommodate advance payments and accruals
. it seems like every time the app updates it turns off automatic mialage tracking. what a pain. then i have to review my calendar and recreate mialage and likely to miss some.
great app. convenient. quickbooks app is very easy to use and makes tracking expenses quick and easy.
no purchase orders. as of feb 2015, i'm unable to find a way to create purchase orders from this app. without the ability to raise orders for inventory, i cannot run my business, so the app is useless for me. seems handy, so i wish it worked properly.
meh. constantly making me sign out. constantly not updated with what’s online. constantly telling me i’ve got outstanding invoices that have long. we. recorded online.
new version is slick. adding items in the new ui is simple and concise.
works amazing! i love being able to attach pictures right to my expenses when i enter them. it is also really nice to be able to enter expenses on the road. it makes bookkeeping a lot easier!
great app!¡. im always on the go and this app is great when invoiceestimate has to be sent immediately or when there is no computer access¡¡ highly recommended for biz on the go!!
forced payroll system not working. since march 2017 our payroll that they force you to pay for if you have employees has not working correctly. edd efile is non existent, cannot archive reports, and irs efile is sporadic. customer service wont credit any amount nor can they fix the problem even after “escalating” it to priority customer support. three “cases” opened, none of which fixed the problem. do not buy this product.
". pretty much a steaming pile of frustration. don't use it to record invoice pmts. the app will apply the payment not to your chequing account, or the account of your choice, but to some weird account called ""unapplied amount""."
we need an update for iphone x. we need an update for iphone x. in addition, we need the function to add cc recipient when sending out quotes or invoices. other than those 2 things, it is good.
it was barely ok to start with!. i had used quickbooks for several years and then went to the online version. i liked the features it had, but really didn’t like the 600.00 a year fee. for the most part it worked, but never all of the time. then when they raised the subscription price to 720.00 a year, that was it. i said good bye and found another program. no regrets!
app as of lately. every time  every single time  i open app, it tells me it must log out because it’s running critical updates. it worked fine until a week ago. not sure if it’s related to apple software but it’s getting old.
no app support for time activity. come on quickbooks! no time activity entry in the app?! ridiculous!
. great app for small business!!!
love it. small business, no need for a more complicated program, cane send estimates and invoices from my phone. fantastic
. best software
. why can't i see bank account details in the app? you can on the ios app contacted help desk who couldn't help! without access to accounts the app is effectively useless. i have done everything you suggest. home screen is now blank! so even worse than when i started. i have also contacted support with no solution as yet.
i love this app. this is the easiest to use and simplest way to use it.
very slow. this app is very very slow.. 10 minutes to load , another 10 minutes to load customer screen, and 15 minutes to apply 1 payment
excellent interface and convenient app. this app is a life saver and helps me run my small business affairs smoothly. i can submit my invoices and estimates on the go with ease. definitely a must app to have.
. not as user friendly as the desktop edition, but it does that job well.
growing apps. always getting better and better
was enjoying it until ios13 update. this app was working fine until i updated to ios13...... boom! nothing now. crashes on opening everytime.
great app. easy easy for an accounting knucklehead like me. just give my acct the password for taxes and keep going. love it
awesome. streamlines my entire business, saves me tons of time, lets me take credit cards, and best of allows me to bill on the spot.
great enhancements. i can now create or edit invoices and send them with preview to my tenants. fantastic upgrade.
best software. easy for use
great app easy to use. this new version does almost everything online with my smart phone. i can match transactions, add expenses, do almost everything i need to do while on the road. thank you intuit!
wish i could charge cards on file. love the app, just wish i could input new customer's card information and charge the existing customer's cards on file when accepting payments so i could do my accounting from anywhere.
makes it all the easier. program runs excellent always active on me note 3 a couple of things id love to see added. purchase orders and file attachments to invoices this would perfect it for me.
. just the request for this app. i want to use it in my mobile also.
do not update to ios 13. if you rely on the app, don’t update to ios 13 until they make it compatible. it crashes on startup after face id.
good functionality but slow to load. great functionality, good app but it takes too long to load. i don't need the homescreen with current activity to load each time. i just want to add an invoice.
now works with ios13. just updated ios 13 app appears to be working on ios13.
disappointed.. as a qbo subscriber, i thought i could get basic financial reports like monthly profit and loss... not so. i'm not sure the app is of use to me at all.
. love the invoicing on the go. it makes my customers happy.
slow to update. pretty useless app.
great ui and mobile to desktop experience. i just started using quickbooks about two months ago and i don't know what i would do without it now. it's simple, easy to run a freelance business with. it's helped me become a freelance business and get paid which is the most important part :)
excellent. j ai fait l essai d un mois et je suis conquis ! très bonne application très complète et simple à customiser  la fonction liée au comptes est aussi très pratique m évite de recopier toutes mes dépenses à la main
business made easy. use this app daily keeps everything organized
clunky. will not keep me signed in, the thing is a nightmare
. app keeps closing right after opening even after uninstalling and then installing and also clearing app cache and data.
fantastic software !. this has made my life a whole lot easier. invoice and estimates on the go. i really feel in control of my accounts.
quickbooks app. does not work well. needs a lot of improvements. each time i back up my files i end of with multiple copies on my ipad. have called several times and each time they blame the app developer which i have contacted but never heard back from them. poor program that needs fixing to get it up to good standards. do not recommend until they fix problems.
reduced feature set. need to have timesheet function put into app! please!!
no support for canadian tax system. intuit's quickbooks for web does not support the canadian tax system. not sure why this app is appearing in the canadian app store.
. currently a subscriber to many quickbooks services. unfortunately, i am no longer able to access my account via the app on my mobile device after the latest update. will update my rating if the issue can be remedied
awful!. this latest update is awful! i have had nothing but problems saving notes and attachments. plus it looks really weird! i like the previous version much better, it actually worked! thanks for messing up a perfectly good product!
great & uptodate!. this is a great little app to give you access into the back end of your quickbooks online account. great for doing simple invoicing and adding expenses. i still use the desktop browser for more complicated reports and such. well done and intuit keeps the app up to date thank you!
basic functionality. just signed up for quickbooks online. the android app installed fine on my new samsung tablet. no issues running and using app. however, the app is minimal functionality. there is also no good dashboards like the pc or online web version of the program. pretty disappointed being development of such features is not complicated nor expensive for a home dashboard.
. says its free, requires subscription.
add more countries. i really love this app but my country, ghana is not part of the selected countries please kindly add it.
. keep having to login which is annoying. very slow in general. app doesnt update automatically. i have to manually update which takes forever for a relatively small number of changes to be downloaded. after 3 years, still quite disappointed with it.
jan 2019 update is a fail. it no longer lets you log in with your fingerprint or face id.
". the app failed to associate my quickbooks online account with the app at login. ""it seems like you have an account with intuit but no quickbooks online company associated with : my@email would you like to create a company?"" additionally, when trying to troubleshoot this issue, i was given the run around through all services... from faqs, to online support, to calling directly. issue still unresolved."
needs improvement. i love the desktop version but my app version and even the online version never works right! there is always something that doesn't work. i always go through the whole estimate or invoice and then it won't save it for me! very frustrating and i wish they could work out all of the kinks.
fix finally now i can get back to work.. this version fixed the errors from the last update. glad it working again. quickbooks has been good except the last update. this one fixed the issue. we us this app for our onsite business and it's great. several times i would send an invoice to the customer when i'm leaving their home and before i get to the next job it's already paid. update. does not work again. :(
. an absolute must for small business.. and seek advice from tech support before assuming. functionality isn't there. ive had no problems... gives me confidence in my books
quick booksamazing app..!. please mail to this id anuhari036@gmail.com excellent app to work...it's really very useful to me...can you please tell how to invoice? thank you quick books for this amazing app!! it's really very helpful..!
quick books. not happy with the new update i have a vision problem and it makes it hard to see and read please change it
finally. there has been a massive weight of my business and shoulders thanks to this software. the ease,simplicity and on the spot actions you can do with this make it truly one of a kind.
qb app. this app worked fine but up until this recent update there are a few glitches and it shuts down in the middle of updating and invoice!
pretty good. this app is great. the quickbooks online system is fantastic. essential to running my business.
passwords. i signed up seen the expense and uninstalled it after looking at other apps i decided to return to this app but when i tried signing in it gave me a error message so i tried reseting the password and have entered my verification codes but still can not log in. i would like to possibly purchase the app but this is very difficult since i can't get in
don't be in a hurry. you need to be very aware of what your doing. the user interface can be a little but if a puzzle. otherwise a useful tool.
. love it, can do most things on my phone too, really useful for a tradesman
can't set it up. tried to get this to work but every time i go to the web page t set up the account etc it just sits there white a spinning timer at stage 2 of 3 of the setup. tried loads of times but just won't work. think if i ever get this working my first invoice will be to quick books for wasting so much of my time
needs improvement. supplier side is useless, plz improve, thanks
invaluable. i am a mobile mechanic and use quickbooks on my journeys to write invoices, receipts and estimates. i wouldn't be without it
useless out in the field can't work off line. useless out in the field can't work off line and constantly wants you to refresh data. does not support star portable printers. waist of space on cell phone gave it a second try useless creating a invoice have to use search window to find items. had to go use desktop instead of my ipad pro because would of took all night to do a invoice.
very good!. really does help to keep everything at your finger tips, it's a convenient way to keep track of your earnings and invoices. one quick glance and you know where your company is at! 👍🏻
poor design. very hard to navigate and understand. customer service only works bankers hours and not when you need them.
very useful. great app yo keep up with your income and expenses. i just love the way everything is set up.
. great app & software. very helpful. would be nice to be able to keyword search within all estimatesinvoices.
. great app for managing a small business!
credit card interface is awesome. i know all apps aren't perfect, but this one does everything i need. i'm so happy when i can set up a new client, invoice and receive payment immediately! this has really improved my cash flow!
"yay...it's working again!!. qbs has been quite efficient and easy to use! i appreciate like the constant improvements!! however, note to developer...i wish this app gave ""real time"" remindsnotices of when to bill a client based on days, just to make it more customized???!? maybe add a calendar with an to synchronize with the personalipad calendars??? i down know, i just find myself calculating day for my customized client each time, instead of just getting a notification. thank, still love this app!!!"
statement from app ?. works great for me but i wish you were able to print off a statement from the app.
. bank feeds never update. been telling me to check back in a couple of hours for 3 days. resync doesn't work. completely useless without updated banking information. uninstalling and never returning. stick to the web browser bc this app is a waste of my time and space!
great. i love this app. it does what i need.
. just wish you could attach receipts before accepting a bank transaction.
. great app for small business owners that are always on the go..
. very useful
just too expensive.... i run a small business and can't afford the monthly dues of qbo. hoping they come up with a more competitive product at some point...
. very useful and easy to use on the go. price friendly too
. reliable. simple. improves my efficiency tracking receipts.
pretty good..... i'm somewhat of a novice independent contractorpsychotherapist. i've been using quickbooks since 2014 and have been using the app for about a year. the dates of invoice reflect the date of service so this is helpful. i know for sure i do not use all features to their full capacity but it's worth the monthly investment for sure.
o melhor!. excelente!!! minha ferramenta de gestão financeira.
junk. this app is an embarrassment to use. doesn't attach correct to emails, rude default email tags, and prints too light to fax. i used qb contractor for 10 years before being talked into ipad by apple as the way to go mobile. save your money do things right. this freezes up a lot too which if you have time to wait may be for you.
. can't attach pdf to invoice (only jpeg) on pc we can attach pdf.
good program. qb online is very accessible
. what a joke......the sales team are so rude....software is actually pretty good but the attitude of the staff in th sales team have completely put me off using this! i will now be looking elsewhere (fresh books etc).....
very user friendly!. quick books makes life simple!
. best app to have to keep updated!!!!
. love this app. life has gotten so much more organized and business transactions so much easier
great app. great app. gives me complete flexibility while operating my small business!
app doesn't work at all. after attempting to log in several times the app crashes every time. i cannot rely on it for work so it's useless.
. user for 2 years, samsung s8, app fails to load now. when it did work, it never showed historical customer transactions. never properly refreshed bank connections oh, you would have to go to the online portal and update first before you could use or see your transactions on this app. i'm pretty fed up at this point with this app, only thing i really wanted to do at this point was use the receipt scanning but i can't even do that now. uninstalled..
more than convenient, it's necessary. having the app makes it so much easier to do business on the go. you can send estimates and invoices before the client meeting has even ended. efficient and essential!
broken. the last update broke the app. various error messages. can’t safe expenses anymore. errors include asking to chose a template before saving expenses etc. bad woek
. very easy to use, takes little effort to keep track of all your sales and spending. i do wish it had a spot to put miles withought buying the mile version though.
unusable. stopped working after ios 13 update, can't add expenses and support is unresponsive
making life simple. best way to run your business.
the best app ever!!!!. there's no word i can use to describe this app. this is the best app i've ever seen. the functionality and the ease of use on iphone is amazing. 95% of my daily transactions are done on my phone. i love this app. good job intuit. no app does it better.
"not working. i just downloaded it and it said it was free. it sent me a verification code. when i went back to the app now it is saying i have no subscription. i wish it could have said that in the begging because now my business email is ""registered"" and i can't find a way to delete my email address from this program."
. an amazing business tool. once you learn its functions, it's like having a professional cpa 247 for all your financial accounting needs! highly recommend this app.
. great bookkeeping app
. waist of time app. does what it wants not what you want. worthless
. i can not believe that this app is this bad. i can only see customers invoices that i have been to in last 2 months. i use to be able to see 10 years worth of invoices. please fix asap. unless you can carry a laptop at all times which is not practical this again is useless. hello quickbooks how about a fix?
confusing. very difficult to use.
. i keep getting a error that says unable to view payment because it includes finance charges. very frustrating when you can't view invoices.
terrible app. you are unable to view and use the register, reconcile accounts and other simple everyday banking tasks. logging into your company through a mobile browser, such as the google chrome app for ipad, does give you access to some but not all tasks. isn't the purpose of online banking to be able to perform all banking from mobile devices?
nexus 6p problems. still does not work on nexus 6. i'm trying to run a business this app use to make me efficient. now it sucks that i can no longer log in to upload receipts. i would give it zero if i could.
simple, yet capable. does everything i need and i love being able to use it online, iphone and ipad. on the go flexibility is a must and this app does that flawlessly!
update = crash. haven't been able to use app since updated. disrupting my business. will not open.
app shows incorrect transactions. transactions do not match the selected vendor. works when you have few transactions. once you pass 20k it becomes slow and inaccurate.
. would love to know how this app works but as soon as i open it... it crashes. if you guys fix it ill adjust my review. but until then. you suck. all fixed. awesome work!!!!!
. i'm getting sick of this app real fast it comes tr manly crashes i try calling the 1800 number and nothing
touch id fail. qb  please fix the touch id feature. it's useless.
horrible accounting program. barely an accounting program. one would think qb would create an online version mirroring their desktop software. navigating the online software is a headache, let alone using it for basic accounting purposes. of course qb ever improving their software is as likely to happen as me winning the lottery.
. umhhh love it yar
brian peterson remodel. great app. wish i could attach pictures to estimates and invoices using my mobile app.
app crashing multiple devices (ios 10 & ios 11). i use this app for my business and after the last update the app has been completely useless on my ipad and on my phone. the only way i can log data is by sitting at my computer when i get home from work. please fix asap. using freshbooks until then. thanks.
app, subscription. cannot updat subscription gives error on can’t upload data, now expired, very frustrating need solution
easy and convenient. as a first time user, both app and desk top versions of quick is easy to use. moreover, the app makes my life much easier. even when i'm out of the office, invoicing, paying, receiving, and quick views of current status can be done at the fingertips.
stay well away!. worst software i have used to date. zero customer service. ignores all complaints. takes forever to load. constant problems. not user friendly.
not able to login. never download this app. i have reported this error many times to the quickbooks support team. till this date they haven't even just looked into this issue.
. opened a trial account and went to add an account and it just hung on me. not a good start. also the reviews from other customers are horrendous. this looks like a company that has forgotten to look after it's customers. shame i used quickbooks before and it was great.
no employee section. this app contains nothing to help your employees, only the business manager. quick books could’ve at least added support for timesheets and such since they no longer allow you to save your timesheet in mobile browsers.
love quickbooks!. i depend and use quickbooks everyday and love it. i just wish i could move the items in my estimates are around easily. they are stuck in the spot they are added.
great app even a green horn can use.
. this is a great app, once you figure it out. it is best to have a working knowledge of accounting, or at least how to keep and balance a checkbook. there are many features. some you won't need, but could come in handy as you grow a business. i found the app helps. if you don't forget to use it. keep your receipts. duh.
iphone app is the worst. the iphone app doesn't work. their customer service people admitted it doesn't work. don't even try to use it  too frustrating and a big waste of time. online version and ipad versions are good but too limited for price  reports can't compare year over year
. simple and easy to use. professional
best accounts app. seems to be the best one out there, easy to use on iphone
. i have used it for 3 years managing my business invoices, cash flow etc. it's great!
great but needs some updates. just recently i am unable to log in to my company. i can get on to my online account, but not on the app?? says my email and password isn’t found?
linked bank account. locked out. no customer service.. there is literally no phone support whatsoever for the mobile app. i'm still locked out of this app after linking my checking account.
pretty lame. seriously? the thing crashes a lot , but i can deal with that. the real problem for me is the lack of calendar in the invoice line item. i would love to use this, but if i can't put the date that i provided a service in my invoice, the it is useless to me. too bad safari doesn't work either, or i would just use that.
. i have tried to cancel my subscription yet i have just checked my credit card statement and the subscription is still being taken. please stop this. i wish to cancel. i have followed the instructions and i am still paying for some reason.
. i can not believe that this app is this bad. i can only see customers invoices that i have been to in last 2 months. i use to be able to see 10 years worth of invoices. please fix asap. unless you can carry a laptop at all times which is not practical this again is useless. hello quickbooks how about a fix?
. perfect for anyone in business. easy to learn and navigate. my clients love the fact i can give them a written proposal or invoice on the spot.
ez modern business book keeping. i love this app program... it's very ez to apply it with your business services.. download it 2day!
. great app
chrashing in estimates. the app is great, only hiccup is that it restarts as soon as i go into opening a new estimate
. very, very slow and to much freezing between transactions. i can't work properly. you need to speed up!
broken. for the last two weeks every time i log in it tells me i have no online company.
demoted from 5 stars to 4. using the app on ipad and iphone for more than 5 years. dashboard has been unable to properly show invoice status for at least 3 months now. version 17.9, at least 3 updates ago? no fix yet nor response from intuit after feedback. while i’m not fond of frequent updates, one expects to have these kinds of obvious bugs fixed in the next update.
. connect to banking and reconcile in minutes. email invoices...so no snail mail.
valuable tool to have in the field. i installed the app, imported company files from my desktop and boom i was doing estimates and invoices in the field.
does the job. great app for fast results
qb online. absolutely perfect i've been using the qb app and this is exactly what i've been looking for i'm a painting contractor and this app is going to make it easy for me. if you are a qb user it's a must get
absolute garbage. the ios app and their windows and os x apps are trash. constant workflow interruptions to relogin, then reauthenticate via email. i've spent hours typing in password and security codes in the last month for no reason. same ip, same computer... no need to constantly log me out and ask for another security code. the only thing their security seems to do is keep me out of my account.
fantastic software. a superb help to my business invoicing and payments are so easy to sendview and accept. easy to use and never had a problem.
much help. other then the normal bugs, this program works well and is easy to work with. nothing in this life is perfect but they strive to make it so. thank you staff of quick books. keep up the good work. peace & blessings.
needs work. need more features like transfers, journal entries and ability to drill down into expenses.
only for ar. this app pretty much just acts as a payments rec'd recorder. has no other functionality that i can see. need to enter vendor invoices on the go so it would be nice if , even if it doesn't have full functionality, you could at least handle vendors and customers on the go.
. very nice system. very easy to use. i would like to be able to pull more reports and have more options in the mobile app.
. great app!
down graded. from april this app is unusable. i down graded to qb online. it appears it was released about a year too soon. nothing but frustration from day one. the ipad and iphone is useless.
. tells me i have an update but will not give me the option to update and will not let me log on
bad update. can no longer accept credit card payments. keep getting error code 6000. tech support advised this is a known issue but no eta on fix. please revert back to previous version.
latest update crashing on iphone 7. app crashes 2sec after being turned on on iphone7. restarted phone, no luck
. makes things sooo much easier and frees up time! no more sitting in front of a computer all day a couple times a month doing data entrybook keeping. very user friendly app and program. only thing i have to log on to do is mark and sort deposits on the sales end.
. excellent app to get into your data on the road. i understand more functionality would be useful but being able to raise & query jobs and send out estimates & invoices 'in the wild' on my mobile phone is a real asset.
. one day it did not load. otherwise. great mobile app.
. using a samsung note edge: cannot update estimates at all. been using this app for months and it constantly locks up and crashes.
. so many glitches. pictures for expenses won't save, multiple expenses are copied when trying to enter just one expense, difficulties entering my password, random closing, disappears off my screens and the icon has to be reset.....very disappointing
. great accounting app
. great app! keeps me going while on the go!
. why is quickbooks on ios so much better ??? please update it to ios standards
. samsung galaxy s4 i rarely give five stars. i dont use this app like i thought i would but may in the future.
. continues to make me turn phone off and on or delete app it does not work.
quickbooks online app. very simple use, efficient and stable. i have no complaints!
horrible ever since update!!. this last update completely ruined the app.
ease of use. simple and intuitive. makes it easy to review accounts on the go and create invoices onsite.
app is crap. the quickbooks app very rarely lets us sign in and when it does many of the functions do not work. i’ve contacted customer service which is a complete joke. their suggestion was to check out the message board to see who else may have the problem we have! why? how about fix the problem!
simply the best. so simple to use and makes more time free for myself
ipad. does not work with ipad pro screen that well
easypeasy. this was the first software that made perfect sense for my social media management and marketing company! i'm unclear why there are so many complaints. i have had no problems or unrealistic acceptance.
. great app.
great functions, easy to use. really great invoicing system. great way of keeping incomeexpense records to be able to do your own accounting. can be frustrating when trying to login on the computer sometimes requires an sms to log in even though it's from home computer.
. user for 2 years, samsung s8, app fails to load now. when it did work, it never showed historical customer transactions. never properly refreshed bank connections oh, you would have to go to the online portal and update first before you could use or see your transactions on this app. i'm pretty fed up at this point with this app, only thing i really wanted to do at this point was use the receipt scanning but i can't even do that now. uninstalled..
. simple to use and quick
. great great app
. perfect app for small businesses onthego!
nightmare. since the latest update quickbooks has been a nightmare. multimillion dollar company that relies on mobile invoicing that does not work now!
from xero to quickbooks. i went from sage line 50 (blinkin' expensive but brilliant if your an accountant) to xero (very good for basic invoices but no estimate facilities on the app, no good for my job) to quickbooks online. easy to use. does what i need. reliable and relatively quick.
need improvement. it needs improvements so dont download untill it has updated
easy to use and great for tracking transactions. navigation is straightforward and the software updates quickly
. very user friendly
. being mainly a cis contractor it won't let me make invoices in app so have to use browser which doesn't work so have to wait till i get home to invoice from laptop. any chance of this being resolved
does not function. doesn't load new invoices. app is now useless.
nexus 6p problems. still does not work on nexus 6. i'm trying to run a business this app use to make me efficient. now it sucks that i can no longer log in to upload receipts. i would give it zero if i could.
. not supported android mobile in india. software means that either o mobile or computer should work equally both places, but your software has only web version then how to use your software.
outstanding. love it
. perfect app for small business owners. combines accounts receiveable and bookeeping in one.
. only thing i wish is that the app was more gear to service type industry like pest control other than that phenomenal app
. every accountant's companion.
"works well for me and my needs. i am not a ""power user"" i don't run a multibillion dollar business. this program does more than i can hope to need or use. it is clean and clearly laid out. it does all that i need, and am likely to need, for the foreseeable future. i am very happy with this product."
crashes when downloading. crashes when downloading after initial setup. have not been able to use app. disappointing.
quick book app works amazing!!. love using the app for my tree company lets me be on the road and make up invoices.
. perfect tool. easy to learn and use it
. doesn't work for the last few months on any of my devices. called many times support and they said they are aware of the problem and they are working on it. this is insane!!! i'm paying every month to get the online version and it doesn't even let me sign in. it shouldn't take month to fix such a problem.
good but app missing functionality. the app does not compare to the desktop version. the app does not show menu item for employees. i am using android and have reinstalled as advised by qb support but it makes no difference.
. quickbooks has made it much easier to run my small business and create invoices on the go!
mgrm. great app. useful and easy to use. sample and easy to use
. great app
. so far it does exactly what i need. just starting out so i'm sure there's plenty to learn yet
. this app doesn't do payroll. apparently you can download quickbooks payroll but i couldn't find it. found it online and the google play website said the app is incompatible with all of my 7 different devices. sure this is available in the uk?
. great inaccessibility to app
". the information syncs between the app & the quickbooks online because it's all saved in the ""cloud"". i used a more primitive system before this and wasn't sure how it would work, but i must say that i wish i'd done it years ago. i love quickbooks online. the desktop version is a bit easier to use, so i input from there and access the information whilst i'm out on my phone. it's really easy to resend invoices or quotes whilst i'm out. awesome!"
crashing. after 3 new updates in the last month app keeps crashing and losing everything i am doing.
no longer works with ios 13. i just updated to ios 13. the app now crashes immediately after it tries to launch my company. i tried reinstalling it but no luck. please fix this asap!
. zero! the app says it needs to update, then brings me to a screen giving a choice of uninstall or open. if i choose open, i'm back to the need to update. if i uninstall and reinstall, that's just more steps before i'm back to the same useless place. garbage software.
. quickbooks online helps my company operate from my truck & my house it is very easy to use & once you get the hang of it organizing my business for my accountant it helps in ways i can't explain
rates have doubled with no appreciable improvement in the system. now i just tried to use the app on an ipad and i cant even generate a journal entry... grrrrrrrrrrrr!
"keep getting ""session expired"" message with every log in attempt. completely makes the app nonfunctional for on the go business. critical flaw! please fix it!!"
super cool. i have it with me know on the go and the reporting is also cool. had some challenges as the i initially bought the app through apple but once the i was migrated, problem was solved. i can't stop talking about this app to friends and colleagues. is there a bonus for referring people?
. i operate two companies through the app and notice that suppliers and customers from one company end up being listed in the other! i would give more stars, but this is a glaring issue that needs resolving urgently.
came in clutch. needed to organize and file taxes and p&l reports. quickbooks self employed and main app really helped do this in record time, fast and efficiently. glad i chose quickbooks!
quickbooks online. very good application and it's a very matured application, if only it can support arabic text it will be very suitable to people in this region as well.
. app is very convenient to use but remains shy of all the features that exist on the online web platform. keep up the good work.
stops working too often!. not a bad way to do your estimates in the field and send out invoices but your app stops working way too often for us company wide!!!
. unable to log on anymore from one device, support seems unable to help me. also very disappointed i can't make an invoice in a no service area and have it sync up later. called and emailed support twice now and no updates or response in over a week.
. dreadful experience so far. bought qb 16th dec 2019 and cant get a call back from an english speaker to help me with set up despite multiple attempts! why is sales uk based but support isnt? this is 2nd review  1st disappeared!!! so disappointed and very desperate to get started.
. contractor version of the app
best business app. quickbooks has definitely made running my business much more efficient and has made it easier to close on deals. the estimate tool makes it easy to send professional looking estimates to clients, and with a click, those estimates turn into invoices. you can receive payments through quickbooks as well. add the payroll service and you can run the whole business yourself. i would definitely recommend this to any new business start up.
. just started using qb after 19 years of sage, i must say their customer service is great and i'm using it for 2 business now.
h2a solutions. best way to invoice my customers
. i travel for work and this app is awesome. i can write and email estimates, invoices, and recieve payments on the fly. it makes my life way easier.
it's broke :(. wonderful app, latest update has caused many issues, including signing in with fingerprint or app code. have to do a full sign in each time with email and loooooong password. hope they can fix soon! 😩😖😤
quickbooks. excellent software. easy to use both at home and on the go with mobile device.
it could use some improvements. i would like to have the option to send partial invoices from the app
". signed up, gave cc info, created account, password etc. system then froze, gave me no confirmations and started billing me. spoke with the ""chat help"" which is people who can't spell common words or understand english. they were unable to cancel my account. now i have to through mastercard to get my money back. thank god my business is not dependent on this ancient software."
. keeps crashing on my note 9 cant access the app
ios 11 not ready? lot of bugs and crashes. every time i’m make a new invoice it crashes and take a lot to load and open, still missing two things, send invoices by text message and option to choice your start screen menu
. the app is ok but it is super buggy
super & excellent apps. very user friendly application . i would recommend this software to other people
. really works great. loads fast and easy to navigate. if you have quickbooks on your 1 desktop at home or office, you are in the stone age.
inventory & stock control. where do i find the inventory & stock control feature to invoice stock to the customer! is there a warehouse feature because my stock is also kept in different locations!
reports needed. need simple reports such as sales tally for a given day.
asertek ventures llc loves this app.. great app, it completely changed the way my business works we are ten times as proficient now.
great software. i worked with quickbooks over 5 year and i say 90% of the time works great thats. good for accounting software
. makes life easier for thse of us with mathmatical challenges and poor memories.
hair kreations. simple, fast and reliable
great app. great app quick and easy to make estimates and invoices. would like for there to be more customization such as adding business information to show on them rather than just email address however overall is a great app very happy with it.
useless. useless. confusing and incomprehensible.
very handy tool. in small business? you're going to use this app... a lot!
don’t use the pay options.. app is great but don’t use the pay option. it took a week for the money to hit my account.
love the qbo. mobile expense posting is cool
great app.. will help me tract expenses!!
needs work. this app has a lot of functionality, but lacks consistancy with the web version. as it is today, i can't send an invoice from this app which looks the same as i send from the web version. if what the customer sees becomes consistant i could give more stars.
adding a photo to a receipt should be simple. apparently there was a recent update that removed the add photo option to tranasactions. it's not there any longer. i called support and they tell me i have to create a note, add the photo to that note, then go find the transaction and add the note to it.
. this version of quickbooks app works great. very happy.
quick booksamazing app..!. please mail to this id anuhari036@gmail.com excellent app to work...it's really very useful to me...can you please tell how to invoice? thank you quick books for this amazing app!! it's really very helpful..!
needs work. this won't stay up to date with online or desktop app and i regularly get error messages. this is frustrating and useless.
business at a glance. for the detailed stuff, i like to stick to the desktop version, but for quickly seeing the status of invoices  profit and loss, the mobile app is great.
great!!. works so well. love how easy it is to use, love how seamless the app works as well as the computer version. so easy to send invoices via email. was so happy when i found out easy it is to use!
expense and banking. until these two options are available this app is of little use.
. no support for india, go to hell!!
. so easy to use! i wish i had started to use this when i set up my business! it saves me so much time and i can enter transactions from my tablet which is so convenient. i also love the way it links (safely) to my bank account and automatically brings all my transactions into quickbooks. would strongly recommend!
. sucks...
great for business. this is a great app to use for daily business
logo input. is there an advanced function to insert company logo in the paid version . if yes i will consider subscribing
president. simple to use and effective in support of operational accounting.
nothing works for me. nothing works for me with this app. if i login using desktop, qbo is ok but when i use the app, there is no information; no clients, no invoices, nothing. the subscription says i have a free trial until 2037. phone support was unsuccessful.
. the first couple of months it was working great. the last two months it complete stopped working, i'm paying for it when it doesn't even work. the bank transactions are way off and it not showing my recent bank transactions.
. it's good app , little bit negative about the help desk of qb , i had requested lots of time for some query but noboday can answer.
awesome app!. great product, has everything our small business needs, saved us a lot of time transferring from one program to this. reconciliation is a dream, so simple and easy to work out. have had no issues whatsoever and am very happy with the change over, has made life so much easier. 👍 thank you
the convenience of this service is worth every penny. without this app, i would often forget to log in after a job and record my time on an invoice. now, i can record billable time, field notes and expenses as i perform them, and email the bill to my customer upon my departure. the only thing i would like to see added is a way to record mileage as miles.
crashing. since moving to iphone11 pro  the app keeps crashing. can’t even access it! please fix this as i have to upload receipts to my laptop to add to quickbooks! ain’t nobody got time for that........
doesn’t work with ios13. just updated ios 13 app doesn’t load. even after deleting and readding.
doesn't work for ipad. this app doesn't even load my company info. it keeps returning error trying to load company info. i have contacted quickbooks a number of times and all they say is they are working on the issue and to use a web browser version in the mean time. i have seen about 4 updates released and not one of them has fixed this issue. when will this be fixed?
crashing after ios 13 update. after ios 13. i can not log into my quickbooks app please fix this asap
very frustrating. i can't understand why quickbooks refuses to put time tracking in their mobile app. time tracking is weak at best on a desktop but excluding it on mobile makes no sense. as a graphic designer who only sells time, this is close to worthless.
. the package i purchased was for a small business and the app isnt appart of the package. i purchased the app to help keep track of mileage and other uses.
it's great. enjoy this app
dont waste your time. the support on this app is non existent. signing up is a slow impossible process
easy. great app that is so simple to navigate, and dead easy for business novices. well designed.
simple and easy. great for keeping tabs on your business on the go
some problems. when it works it's great, i use it every day and every day there is a problem, the system tells me they are having problems, please try again later, takes forever to send email. it's very frustrating when you have a business on the go.
easy to edit invoice. was happy to be able to edit an invoice on the fly without the need to be in the office to log onto the computer to do so!
. bank feeds never update. been telling me to check back in a couple of hours for 3 days. resync doesn't work. completely useless without updated banking information. uninstalling and never returning. stick to the web browser bc this app is a waste of my time and space!
quickbooks online. there are a few little glitches between phone tablet and desktop but all in all it's a great program saves time works really well for customers send an email to confirm payment is nice adding a customer in your phone does not work but as long as i use the administrator adding names as i go it works well in the field
"problematic app. upon originally downloading this app i was pleased. for the first 24hrs. i was impressed. then, i ""sent"" an invoice which the customer never received. next, it failed to update or sync with my account. when i attempted to update manually it chronically reported an error sighting that i should check my internet connection. frustrated, i uninstalled and reinstalled the app. now, it doesn't stay open for long before saying it stopped unexpectedly. i've reported every error without receiving any feedback."
. super powerful and great on the go. there is a learning curve as with anything this powerful but quickbooks makes it easy to learn and has the best customer service
great apps. easy to use
not working. unfortunately it's not currently working for me on my samsung s7. i keep getting errors when trying to sign in.
love this app. works great and i can navigate and make invoices and track everything in one app! i love it
terrible support. the feature that you promote in your advertisement for this app shows a person recording his receipts wich mainly are cash or card paid. the options that you have as type of payments are cheque, credit or other. nobody this days pay by cheque or by credit receipts for small amounts!!!! totally useless!!!
mgrm. great app. useful and easy to use. sample and easy to use
love it.. i love this app. easy to use and is pretty reliable within little downtime. however i would like more options like inclusion of sku numbers and the ability to pay for subscriptions within the app.
owner. i have been quite impressed! small owneroperator, able to send invoices, estimates, et al. from my trucklove it!
slow books. i am constantly waiting in front of my customers for qb to load
solid for business. great app for a small nonprofit. easy to navigate and i appreciate the prompts!
great app. for on the go consultants, this is amazing. get paid faster by sending an invoice right after a service visit.
. can't create an account. fails every time. can't update due to server failure. no support available either.
. i love this app
just barely ok.. app has multiple issues . with page format. browser must use google chrome to get all options . called 3 times , on phone over hour each time . weeks later still nothing fixed . app is very limited .. customer service is a joke . here i thought i was upgrading to a better software . lol i was so wrong ..
. great app, traveling business must have!!!!!! i do on the road sale, and i have all i need to get the job done, without having to go back to the office.......
. this app is simple and really easy to use. makes my job way easier.
"awful app... can't even sign in. migrating to qb online so thought app would be great.. wrong! app won't sign in and reports 'communications error' in addition, it's not compatible with my 8"" tablet running android 5x  come on intuit  sort it out"
. works good for what i need which is keeping track of jobs and money invoices and estimates
i looking. hai friends my name is navas abdulla i'm looking some software live sales report ..in store sales promotions company ..any one can to suggest any live sales, report software for sales promoters www.qmpromotions.com it's my website qmpromotions@gmail.com
. i've been trying to download the app for 12 hours. i've got solid internet. i've restarted my phone twice. it wouldn't let me submit a comment until now. what's up?
oakes firewood llc. great app! love it! easy and fast to use. good job!
. great app. very helpful.
time tracking. i can create an estimate on the go and keep track of my time in a job.
needs work. this won't stay up to date with online or desktop app and i regularly get error messages. this is frustrating and useless.
fees?. i paid over $300 for the qb pc program. i wish they had something basic for free.
. love the app! it makes my job so much easier!
. great app! i do wish the pricing was lower
ilove. great job guys! love the look and layout. i will be reaching for my ipad instead of my phone from now on! 4 stars.... would have been a 5 but when i am working on an invoice i can't add service dates. this is important for me and i found myself going for my phone.
fantastic!. i love this app. it works really well, and makes it easy for me to stay ontop of invoicing my customers.
impressed. i put off upgrading to online version after using quickbooks pro for five years, struggling to enter online direct debit expenses and payments. online version makes entering data easy and efficient. such a time saver for me. well done intuit! definitely worth the monthly subscription fee.
. excellent just sometimes login doesnt register
. cant add expenses or clients to qb through my smart phone
. seriously? this is the best you can do? ! so limited on basic functions. *updated review nice try quickbooks on the reply...no, your laughable update is ridiculous! not to mention the mobile device website lockout to access via mobile browser.... taking away another star for bad public relations. welcome to 1996 if you try to rely on this app for your 2014 business.
. useless app. can't integrate one of the biggest bank of australia (cba) with this app. support is just forwarding issue from one team to other. wasted almost one hour on the phone. solution is to forward the issue to next level. there are three companies under my account with same name. cannot delete company. how app allow to create three identical names?? wast of time and money.
basic app. app functions are extremely limited, and i can't use qb web on any browser on ios devices (ipadipad pro 12.9iphone 7plus) as all browsers including safari, chrome and dolphin run in zoomed mode when want to enter invoice, payments, receipts and bills or even check reports and make unusable.
easy to use, instrumental to my business. keep it glitch free please
great app! very easy to understand and use!. great app! very easy to understand and use! david lorea farrington
transactions import. major problem is transactions import . i spent a week looking for the right tool that is compatible with qbo. then i discovered that it will not import because my country that is registered in my account is not usa!!! why qbo doesn't have import transactions feature same as customer import
. until now i'm happy. i attached all my expenses and i can see how much money i have invested in by small business.
ontiretse marumo. amazing app!
. hi team kindly add digital signature...only this 1 thing is missing in this app...overall best experience with you
easy to use. i love my quickbooks app. this is the first year my taxes will be done on time because i didn't have to spend hours at desk!
*terrible app*. do not take the chance with this program its flawed at best and is only designed to take as much money off you for as long as possible. it has multiple errors all the time. find something for better value and don’t pout it in control of your business because when it fails you have no control whatsoever.
best app ever. love quickbooks online.... easiest way to keep all my accounts and expenses in order.
. always been a great app! wish we had better designable invoices but oh well. thank you!!
. very user friendly great app great technical support i recommend it to anyone
. i got the app working. it would be better if you could attach receipts to your expenses within the app. like the self employed app does.
. great software . still learning.
negative stars.... emails won't send to customers... misspelled quantity on invoices... not complicated to fix, no customer service, destroyed my management system, i regret switching...
loss of functionality. i had been using this app for a while without any real issues. however, recently the 'expense' button that pulls up from the '+' menu on the home screen is grayed out...thus rendering the app fairly useless on the go! intuit said they unfortunately didn't have the ability to fix issues with the app.
expenses off. expenses are off. it’s showing expenses from an inactive account on the app. it’s correct on the website, so it’s definitely an issue with the app. i checked and the settings are the same. both should be displaying expenses for this month.
needs a lot of work. app does not show up in recent app list. also it does not sync automatically.
limiting. very limited app
don’t ever sign up for subscription services. i signed up for this and forgot my login credentials. it was a pain to figure out how to cancel it.
. amazing software
touch id rules. much easier to login now.
app crashes. the app crashes immediately when i try to open it. i haven’t been able to use the app for a few months now which is quite disappointing considering i pay for its services.
very beneficial app. this is a very beneficial app. it does not replace the pc version but is an excellent aid. it's helpful to send invoices on the go or at the end of a service call. the sooner the customer pays the more chance you will get paid. as long as you keep things simple it is a very good aid!
. they said in your invoice that you can cancel anytime and it's not true! it has a glitch and i couldn't cancel it. make me lost two days trying to cancel it and then even charge me the month and did not give back my money. they went from 17 dollars a month to 40 dollars per month! don't never quickbooks
. takes hours for a verification email with pin to get sent. i can't wait that long before i can access my accounting!
crashes w ios 9. app crashes after you enter password. intuit has had 3 months to test on beta. customer service has no idea what ios 9 is.
. great app. i love it
don't do latest update. was working great until latest update. now i cannot create any invoices.
qb app is useless. i’ve been quickbooks user for a long time and discovered this app gives a totally different set of numbers than quickbooks online does. expenses are different than real version so please beware, you can’t trust the numbers. contacted support to no avail. i guess they don’t read the other reviews either.
must have for small businesses. this has simplified my life immensely. i no longer have to worry about things falling through the cracks, quickbooks keeps it all in check. solid app, no issues or crashes yet after about 3 months of use.
great, but need voice data entry. especially when mobile device use ... talking to fill in fields would be so awesome ... maybe integrate dragon ... hey ... buy nuaunce to own it all ... the road to intuit world domination! oh, and yes, i am available to negotiate the deal!!!
. works great to create sales receipts in the go and accept transactions into the register. have to do deposits on a computer. but love qbo for being able to use on all platforms.
couldn’t get past sign up!. i downloaded the app and started the “freetrial” setup. it asked for my business name, then my countryregion. when i tapped to enter countryregion, it gave no options. it was blank and did not bring up keyboard for manual entry. so i can’t even use it.
quickbook. on trial will notify later
it begins.... i liked it so much i have it for 2 seperate businesses and just moved my household accounting onto qbo. the accountant can get to everything from his desk, me from my phone. auto download of account data, auto reports are awesome!
needs work!. not very user friendly... makes me download my companies data every time i login and takes forever and sometimes crashes while downloading it so have to restart the download again. qbo is great but they really need to work on the app cause i could really use it when on the road. but incapable due to its functionality at the moment.
excellent app. keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
. this app makes attaching pictures of paper receipts easy.
. great on the go invoice app
help. there doesn't seem to be a way to tie in purchases on to a invoice to charge specific customers. when you call in for help with the app, customer service does not have access to see what you're looking at.
. excellent app makes having a small business so simple
trouble with ipad app. hello, i have the app in my iphone and it works great, but i have downloaded the app in the ipad and it tells me: looks like your account doesn’t include access to the quickbooks online mobile app... what i need to do to have access?. please advice! thanks
nice, but they increased price a lot!. i like the app but am concerned with how much they just increased price for my service.
even worse after last update. didn't think the time loading could get any worse. i was wrong. ap is pretty much useless while with a customer. everything takes forever to load. need to sign in every. single. time. then you click out of the ap and right back in and it makes you use the touch id. super sucky. i very much dislike, yet i need to use it everyday. ugggggggg.
makes life easier. does everything i need! only 1 suggest...i want to sort quotes by date created...
not happy. when i first got the app i fell in love i had problems with the desktop version , with the bank option on the online version which you removed i was able to log in my transactions very quickly , i would appreciate it if you would please bring back the bank option in the menu asap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
app crashes in ios 13 & 13.1 .. app crashes in ios 13 & 13.1 . customer service had no clue
. great program a little expensive but well worth it
best app. very helpful online support
not a replacement. not fast. doesn't sync well.. this app needs a lot of work to be reliable and usable. no matter how many times i sync it doesn't actually sync to the web apps data. it keeps logging me off the fingerprint option. this might be designed in there because human fingerprints change very often? correct?
. very nice. easy to manage your business on the go.
needs lots of work. very hard to use app. many options are hidden or unavailable so you are stuck and wind up doing the work through a browser instead
crashes 3 seconds after opening. latest version is completely unusable on both iphone and ipad. crashes 3 seconds after opening. both on iphone and ipad. did anyone actually test this?
. customer service is absolutely horrible. signed up yesterday online. found out customizing invoices function has been broken for 3 months. call this morning to cancel subscription and get a refund. they're answer basically was we've got your money we're not going to refund it. you have been warned stay away from quickbooks
. makes my life super easy. i cans end invoices on the go, receive payments as i open my mail, super easy!
. great app makes my life much easier.
so far so good. so far it does everything i want it to do. if you're looking for an easy to handle app that keeps u up to date look no further.
. awsme app
update needed asap. i also have been using this app for years (it’s great when working properly) but something happened after this last update and i’m getting kicked off and signed out in the middle of my invoices and estimates. it’s staying “an important update is required” or something like that and i’ll go to update the app but it’s already updated! and i’ll log back into the app and get kicked off again with the same message.....
. good and easy to use great app
crashes. downloaded this onto my ipad. as soon as i open it up it instantly crashes.
getting there.. this app was the absolute worst waste of time when it was launched. but now they are syncing the interface with the browser based app and it's very useful.
. best accounting app ever
missing time activities feature. this app is pretty good for the most part, however, it is missing the time activities feature like on the browser based software. please add this feature!!
. great app
. doesn't give the full qbo experience, if it is it's not the same ui edit  dislike that devs pick what they feel is most convenient.
bad. the worst customer service (intuit)
. i can see my subscription for months. click to manage subscription and i am told i have none. haven't used thus app but have been paying for months. help
good app and service. after the last update, i can’t create an invoice after i add a customer. it crashes every time on my ipad. it still works on my phone. please fix this issue.
new business. i just opened up my business and i'm being super careful of keeping track of all my financial expenses and sales. this app makes it easy!
. very easy to use software, professional looking documents issued and logical methodnof keeping books.
great small business tool. great for sending invoices, tracking due invoices, and emailing with document or pic attachments. cut out a good deal of my paperwork.
. took me a whole while to register an account, just to get: you don't seem to have a subscription.
wow!. really cool app! it's linked on all my device! i can make invoices on my phone and send it to my clients directly from email! cool stuff!
most productive app. using this app on my iphone and ipad hs made my life so much easier! i've been able to invoice my customers without having to lug me laptop around. truly an awesome app!
garbage. doesn't log in. rubbish. unimpressed
awesome. can't imagine running my business without this app. total complete solution for mobile businesses like mine. my accounting is done so much quicker, and i love being able to see all client info from the phone. thank you, thank you and thank you!!
app is limited on what your can do. the app would be more helpful if i could categorize transactions while on the go among many other features the desktop version offers.
. really, no way to tell a bank account to go get updates? i wasted my time downloading and using this app.
. unable to edit or delete products on setup pretty disappointed couldnt load suppliers not an easyapp at all. plus the set tutorial is different to app presented for 10.95 a month
. as an accountant it is a handy app to have installed on your phone.
. estimate and invocies are greate only thing i would like to see change is a quixk customer function so i do not have to add every one
. great app, would like more control from mobile devices
. no good for basic simple book keeping and way to complicated. why would you trust a group of app developers will your banking details
offline mode. i wish i could enter transactions without an internet connection. then they would synch after the device reconnects.
perfect for first time small business owners. maintaining all the records for a construction company can be intimidating; quickbooks has made it less stressful and easier to do my job!
broken app?. once i log in it says there has been an error and closes. could someone from intuit please get in contact with me about this?
. great app. works for everything i need. had a few issues but they were resolved.
awesome app. i was hesitant going to the monthly subscription, but it has been awesome always having access to my business account. the app looks and works just like the desktop app on my mac.
unable to sync. all i get is errors about syncing. different phones. same problem. works great in my ipad, though!
"problems. this app will not let me save an invoice, it always says ""this number already exists"" no matter which number i add. only started the error on the 301112, please fix."
quickbooks. great app!!
very useful. just as fluid as the full version on my pc. easy to use, and can generate invoices quickly..
can’t use it in iphone or ipad! keep getting error.. i keep getting an error! queryprocessingerror:null
user friendly!. this is definitely the bookkeeping app for anyone who is not attuned to being a business owner
not bad, not amazing. it's quick books. the app gives you access to some information, but not everything.
great mobile app. perfect for my mobile power washing company as all my customers and estimates are available at the touch of a button no matter where i am!
no major complaints thus far. pretty convenient to do on the phone. i guess it's worth the subscription fee.
. crashes often
. so far not happy. it doesn't show my address nor phone number on quotations and i can't find a way to make it do so. also states 30 day free, then gives me a measly 24 hrs from the time of install to save with a monthly discount. ok, i'll bite. they immediately sucked my first monthly payment. where's this 30 day free trial? biggest thing is its extremely limited and not ready for prime time. poor release.
sync problema.... does not sync transactions with business bank and credit card unless you login to the quicbooks website...i have to login to the website all the time to use the app..what good is the app..disappointed that such a well funded company can have such a poorly developed app
pretty good could be great. this ties in nicely with the desktop version. it's not 5* purely because of the actual software not the app itself. the customising of the invoice isn't great and adding previous invoices when you first start isn't great but if you're not worried about that it works well!
great program!. very easy to use!
roofing company. the app is great, although it needs an update with bugs fixed. the app won't allow me to modify, save or send invoices. very frustrating.
easy invoices. although some setups require a full web browser this app is great for new companies setup and invoicing.
stopped working after the update. this was working great until the software update last week. now i end up creating multiple copies of invoices and estimates and the app just freezes on the saving screen. i can only finish off by logging in through a web browser and completing the task. please fix this fast intuit!
can’t generate po’s. 90% of my business is generating and sending po’s which you can’t do with this app for some stupid reason. i’ve been requesting the feature for years (which i shouldn’t have to request) and quickbooks has never responded.
. the app is good. they can still work on some parts to make user experience better.
fantastic qb's app. this app is great! works just as good, if not better, as the desktop version. to me it seems even more user friendly & it is just so convenient when on the go. definitely download! it works so well, i decided to pay the monthly fee to use it.
. the app is currently not working as i cannot login for the last few days. i can login to their website so it's just the app. i have sent the error log a few times and still no fix. i have deleted the app and redownloaded still no luck.
doesn’t work on ios13. hoping for another update as it doesn’t work on ios13
. i'm getting sick of this app real fast it comes tr manly crashes i try calling the 1800 number and nothing
good expense tracker. good for tracking expensing. everything else really needs to be done from the desktop version. handy little app, but it needs some work to truly run things from this app.
more than convenient, it's necessary. having the app makes it so much easier to do business on the go. you can send estimates and invoices before the client meeting has even ended. efficient and essential!
". mobile app is full of bugs, recent ""update"" has now made it so my account is unable to sync and wont let me log in. not very useful for my mobile business. tried reinstalling the app, still no luck. *tried clearing data, same issue."
. the app is a wonderful accompaniment to the software which makes tracking expenses and invoices really easy
. after updated the app to the latest version, this app can no longer be used as it keeps forced closing.
. this is a good program. however when using the app i cannot edit saved customers address for different job addresses to do invoices quicker on job sites.
improving but still a long way to go. like the new dashboard, but need ability to set ytd totals, more report options, does not show all my bank accounts. needs to be more customizable. app does not replace the website version, which is still needed to do any real work. best feature is the easy way it handles the bank feeds.
. not updating fields.
bmb. i cannot connect with my canadian credit union. have been using app for several months now. it is both good and bad. i love that i can take my work with me to record with my ipad, but would like to be able to transfer transactions from quickbooks online to quickbooks pro 2014.
makes it so easy.. it is fast and simple to use. this has been a great addition to my took kit.
". getting this message last 3 days. ""there was a problem syncing your data. wait a few minutes and try again"". please fix this"
best app ever. i've used qbs for a long time and it gets better every year.
no support. very disappointed i am no longer able to access p&l or balance sheets on ipad. it’s been over 1 month and still the brain trust cannot make it work...
. i can't remember the last time i was this frustrated with an app andor company. more often than not, the app andor the website do not work. they sure don't have any issues with their autorenew and collecting money from users. they just can't figure out how to provide a product that works and customer service that can, or even wants to, help. think long and hard before choosing quickbooks for your business. i wish i had.
. this app loads so unbelievably slowly and hangs all the time. it also has different data from the web version in the p&l reports along with not being able to categorize expenses into some chart of accounts however works fine in the web page version.
. great app for business!
quick easy to use.. always there at my fingertips. love it ..use it....my business is now updated and current. .!!!! couldn't live without it.
. cannot log in don't have online subscription
easy business.. makes business income and expenses easy to track and manage payments.
response to the quickbooks online account app. i love quickbooks accountant online program; but i noticed that there are limits to the quickbooks accountant online app capabilities compared to what the downloadable online quickbooks accountant software program could do. otherwise, really happy with online quickbooks accountant program!!
. quickbooks is useful for non finance managers like myself. hopefully improvements will continue on some of the less obvious areas
some great options. it is great being able to create and send invoices when done with job rather than waiting to get back to the office. i wish that was true with vendors. have only been able to view it but not create bills or make payments. would like to be able to process vendor payments as well. i do find that when i email an invoice the name does not show up in the email.
. thanks i love this app i'm able to carry my work with me everywhere thanks qb
. make estimates easier highly recommended
user friendly. very happy so far....
. will not let me create and save new transactions with htc one. please fix this issue. using mobile browser is very frustrating.
update needed asap. i also have been using this app for years (it’s great when working properly) but something happened after this last update and i’m getting kicked off and signed out in the middle of my invoices and estimates. it’s staying “an important update is required” or something like that and i’ll go to update the app but it’s already updated! and i’ll log back into the app and get kicked off again with the same message.....
. does not work its rubbish app
needs a lot of improvement. missing a lot of features and information available with the web browser connection. can't see vendor history. can't sort how inboxes etc are listed. a few other issues. freezes often. in the middle of invoice entry, the system bounced me out for some reason, while not saving the work i had entered to date. did that twice. before i closed out and went to pc web connection. i love the possibility this app offers, development need to fix and enhance
very disappointed. there is very little you can actually do with the app.. not impressed am canceling the account.
disappointing. i've been a longtime user of the desktop version of quickbooks for the past 20 years and just recently switched to quickbooks online. i was really looking forward to managing my company's expenses, print checks, and enter bills from my new ipad. i am terribly disappointed in the complete lack of features available in this app. it's actually completely useless and a waste of memory. how could intuit release such a piece of garbage such as this?
we love the qb app. one of the most useful things we have “out in the field” is our qb app that allows us to do bookkeeping by extension. probably the craziest place yet was checking qb from the pyramids of giza in egypt. it’s extremely convenient.
. nice app
overall pretty good as an app👍. it can take awhile to get used to using quickbooks – but it is pretty good once you get used to it. occasionally it can be a bit clunky and you don’t get all the functionality that you would expect. but overall using it as an app is very good
fix finally now i can get back to work.. this version fixed the errors from the last update. glad it working again. quickbooks has been good except the last update. this one fixed the issue. we us this app for our onsite business and it's great. several times i would send an invoice to the customer when i'm leaving their home and before i get to the next job it's already paid.
. the app does everything i need it to and more.
. very good app
love it.. i love this app it is very convenient and works so nice when i'm on the run for quick access
awesome. i couldn't run my small business like a big business without quickbooks! just that awesome and simple!
excellent. quickbooks online has created a whole new dimension to bookkeeping and accounting for small business. the ipad app is very useful for an overview of transactions
not helpful. this app doesn't help me. i get errors every time i try to match or categorize a transaction from my bank. it's useless for me.
forces login twice. app started logging out after i log in. forcing another login. worked great before that.
brilliant mobile app. it has changed my life . i am able to do quotes in the run and save so much valuable time .
best version yet!!. i run a company with revenues over 2 million dollars annually with qb. i can take care of everything i need from invoicing, estimating and accounts payable to payroll and everything in between. the app adds even more flexibility by not requiring my laptop or tablet to create these. the reports and reconciliations are second to none.
buggy. crashes all the time. always bugging to buy things. bad. uninstalled
great app. good for a non accounting person like me. i can keep track and give it all to my accountant and it gets done. i love that i can send invoices from my ipad and enter info etc. two thumbs up!
. great app
. app never up to date with website or it does not show you everything you can see online. sometimes you can't even see anyone's invoices or estimates. always an issue.
. superb app
very good app.... i truly love this app! it permits me to oversee my business' financial condition in real time. i use the qbo plus, it would be nice if it had more of the options present in qb premium for consultants. the project management and customer billing customization would make this an even better app.
best business app!. so easy to use!! very clear info and graphs make it quick and easy to check your profit and loss and see exactly where you spend money and where the most income is coming from!
not for indian. please do remember this app is not useful for indian currency so don't waste your data.
. great program to use. super simple to learn. has everything you need to run a small business.
. don't fill up your information for free trial it's easy to set up for free trial. they doesn't have options in app for unsubscribe your free trial. you have to reach them every day for unsubscribe your free trial. if you not satisfied from app then start call them before 5days, they will not answer your call till your free trial not get expired. be careful before you sign up.
simple. très facile à utiliser
love it. it is nice to be able to enter expenses and check invoices on the run.
easy to use. easy access to all key features and very responsive app
. easy to use, easy to keep your invoices accurate, costumers like it
business. great app
. restart the app error. uninstalled and reinstalled app. same error.
what a joke. downloaded this app so i could pay employees and taxes on time without having to be at my computer and i can't do either, i have to be in front of my computer to do both. i don't understand why it's not allowed on mobile app.
. makes sending and tracking invoices simple.
. hasn't worked on my android phone for over a week. says error syncing data and rarely loads historical info. lost ability to photo invoices and seems to have lost tax settings as always wants to create them despite setting this up and using for 7 months now. support says they are aware and working in it for a week now
. love the website! app could be made a bit better. and there is no discount column in invoices. please add discount!
convenient app!. good app, just wish it would migrate previous category info for existing payees. it would be 5 stars then.
fix finally now i can get back to work.. this version fixed the errors from the last update. glad it working again. quickbooks has been good except the last update. this one fixed the issue. we us this app for our onsite business and it's great. several times i would send an invoice to the customer when i'm leaving their home and before i get to the next job it's already paid.
credit note cis. you cannot issue a matching credit note for an invoice with cis deduction, despite speaking to qb for over 2 hours they admitted they dont know how to do it.
love it. my entire business is conducted through my iphone. thanks qb for making life so easy!!! greatest app for any small business, hands down!!!
. doesnt work on my acer tablet anymore
. good app. have a few things i would like to see added. i have made suggestions and am sure they will accommodate in due course. makes me more efficient. have come to rely on app and would have otto spend a lot more time on data entry and research without it.
. bekar hai do not any mail id login don't open
didn't work for me. kept getting an error that i don't have an online account. yet it asks me to verify and gives me my cell or email to verify with.
. for 80% of what i would like this app to do its great not bad
crashes. the app just crashes as soon as it starts to load. don't waste your time downloading it.
better improvement. app running better
okay. i'm new to doing my own bookkeeping and find this product clunky and not very easy to use. issues with importing transactions and program changing dates and the order compared to the bank. it's not very easy to see what account transfers are moving tofrom. it's hard to distinguish credits for debits. poor customer service. no good summary graphs. slow to attach receipts. multiple clicks to do basic things. cuts off file names if there too long.
keshav. it is a beautiful software. very flexible and user friendly. it made my work so simple. thanks to quick books!
. great app i love it
. hard to use. i bought it because of taking pictures of my receipts and i've yet to get that done. plus the app doesnt work on my phone. have to log in each time. if i had it to do over again i would not waste my money.
. simple to use and powerful tool
very happy. i love this app for my business
so glitchy!! 😡. quickbooks has the potential to be great. but this app is so, so glitchy! have constant problems with it and i'm really getting to the point of giving up and going back to sage. every time a problem is sorted, a new one pops straight back up. if they could employ some decent tech guys and get things working properly, this would be brilliant.
a good idea but not very useful yet. there is not access to the important online reports. there is no access to fx transactions or accounts in a foreign currency. i live overseas and bill my clients in us dollars and as such have no access to client information or us dollars sales and accounts. if the app mirrored the online program it would be great but it doesnt!!
. i use this for my startup business. the invoices help a lot!
major flaw  can't run payroll or attached from dropbox. 3 stars as you are unable to run payrol on the go or even view payroll  employees wages which is a major part of this app that is missing. also when uploading attachments you can attached anything other than a photo. no links to dropbox etc which again is a major flaw
finger print touch does not work. generally ok, not impressive. please fix problem with finger print touch open feature. i keep trying and it will only work one time. i'm still being asked for password.
. best accounting software for small business......
background usage accounts for 50 percent of battery life. this app completely drains my battery. i thought my battery was broken and was about to replace it, but apple tech report suggested i check on battery usage by app and i discovered quickbooks was the culprit.
jan 2019 update is a fail. i’m a daily  hourly user. the january 2019 update won’t keep me logged in. after about 90 seconds i get an error message and get logged out.
quickbooks. great app for on the go
"cheap. it's one of those slickly apps that pops up in your search result which is filtered to show only free apps. after you waste your time downloading and signing up, it tells you to start your free ""trial""."
gary stanton. this app means i can seem to know what i am doing, it actually works for me.
. amazing app. handles all my needs as a small contractor business.
affordable truck repair inc.. great app, makes it very easy for us to keep track of our books.
awesome. love this app... i'm about to do a lot of work from my phone.
. great app! easy to use and helps me keep track of our church income and expenses.
app
great app!. this app makes it so much easier to manage your quickbooks online account from the road or the office or anywhere!
class. i can't seem to use classes in the app. i have them through the web version, but here i can't filter in the report. please add
very user easy. this app is great. very user friendly!
. the app is horrible. doesn't update ky information, ia like a month behind. very frustrating. you are good at billing me every month, that part is up to date🙄.
awful program. glitchy... no help at all from customer service, i paid my fee and they used it to open a new account instead of paying for the one i had. “unable” to refund me... i spent three hours on the phone today with three different people, absolutely no help, no service, no one has any idea what the hell they’re doing, a very poorly run company. disappointed
doesn’t work. i have an iphone 8 and all of a sudden this app stops working. i call quickbooks and they can’t fix it. they closed the case in one day. don’t walk away from this company, run away.
great small business tool. very easy to navigate and enter information. i can enter data on my home computer and then access it with my phone when i'm not in the office. great app
really2 great application. i wish i have found this software 8 years back and it can help me save thousand spent on trying many other software
glitchy, incomplete features, and poor data. this app needs serious attention. after years of putting up with this hot mess i’m fed up and rarely use it any more. no matter what i do i can’t get data to load that is any more recent than 2016 for most vendors. no one from tech support replies  ever. american express transactions can’t be synched or approved in the app. about the only thing it’s useful for is matching typical transactions in our checking account.
makes books much easier to keep updated. this is a powerful combination of mobile, camera, and bookkeeping. much easier than relying on the desktop.
quality product. i've just taken over the accounts for the business with little experience and knowledge and i have found quickbooks online very easy to use. issuing invoices and running payroll is quick and simple. the support is extremely good too from professionals who know what they are doing not just anybody in a call centre reading a script.
app crashing multiple devices (ios 10 & ios 11). i use this app for my business and after the last update the app has been completely useless on my ipad and on my phone. the only way i can log data is by sitting at my computer when i get home from work. please fix asap. using freshbooks until then. thanks.
. can't view financial report when i use android phone, could you fix it?
. nice accounting apps.. very usefull..
". i have got a problem to add my bank details. the website doesn't work, after i chose ""i agree"" (under my bank description of using). please sort it out asap."
only for ar. this app pretty much just acts as a payments rec'd recorder. has no other functionality that i can see. need to enter vendor invoices on the go so it would be nice if , even if it doesn't have full functionality, you could at least handle vendors and customers on the go.
. poor. this app worked fine for 2 years and now they have recently removed the feature where it automatically adds receipts to transactions. the support morons keep telling me it never existed in the first place but i used it for 2 years! i'm now looking for another app to use in it's stead. avoid it at all costs.
. very good app. make invoices in a snap.
. takes awhile for the accurate data to load. you have to refresh a few times. does not pull up anything when selecting any kind of activity on a customers account.
new business.. very user friendly. almost like apple designed it. very unhappy that the email function doesn’t work. many people have complained for over a year and quickbooks still hasn’t offered a fix😠. i have to take a screenshot and copy and paste to my email. not as professional looking, but gets the job done. that one glitch took away two stars because i can’t use my mobile phone to give someone an invoice or estimate.
disappointed. needs touch id for login, and bugs fixed for ios 8.
small business asset. easy way to keep track off all those expenses, invoices, payments etc for a small business owner with little time to spend on administrative stuff.
quickbooks online. there are a few little glitches between phone tablet and desktop but all in all it's a great program saves time works really well for customers send an email to confirm payment is nice adding a customer in your phone does not work but as long as i use the administrator adding names as i go it works well in the field
. great for invoices on the go! for small business.
. i have been using this app for few years now and i love it.
terrible. so many problems i don’t even know where to start. i transferred my desktop version to online with the last year and half reconciled. i know have to go back and reconcile again. also  it keeps crashing. there are good things about it but overall not so happy with the software.
horrible. this app and their customer service is terrible.
. never used an app before for my bookkeeping but feel confident this is the way to go. this app is good though plenty of room for improvement. i am now using it and have used it to now feb 2018. so far so good higly recommend it for all business people on the go
. great app
very nice to use. great app
the worst app ever. this app is the worst app i have ever used. takes too long to update data .... and sync hardly ever works... does not have overview screen where it shows balances on accounts... no option to sort list differently... showing the oldest payments, open invoices on top... no option to change sorting methods... too many things to list...
. excellent app, love it.
update. please fix soon app opens and closes after update.
indispensable tool. all business owners should have a mobile app that makes finances easier to manage. this is one of them. thank you intuit!
no complaints. does the job.
fairly useless. this app is difficult to navigate. it doesn't come close to mimicking qbo for pcs. the functionality is very limited. it's ok for looking up some things but difficult to update info such as logging checks or deposits.
was awesome my nexus is not supported!. this is what i've been waiting for for years. 10 out of 5 stars if i could. but since my mobile decide is not supported.... hate to say it but worthless!
. fix sales tax to enable for existing customers!
excellent tool for my biz. since i got this app on my phone i hardly need to go to the office, or open my laptop. love it!
crashes on large invoice. works fine until you get a large invoice and then it slows down and or crashes
be careful. i loved this app for 10 months. then an error occurred and i lost access to my business. only cost me $200 for one time fix. for $600 i could have purchased a 3 month fix. the risk exceeds the benefit.
horrible. please update this app so it stops crashing during every use!!! also, critical updates every time you try and do anything???? getting old and frustrating. fix it!!!!! also, why when you update a transaction, it saves it from before the update, so you are doing the work twice???
. enjoying the ease of use. good app!
it gets better and better. i was a huge sceptic (i have been a pro advisor for several years)and very had a very negative opinion of qb online. that was until a couple of years ago when i attended a presentation of the capabilities of the software. i was sold on its usefulness and have been using and recommending it ever since. qb online adds important features regularly. buy it!!! you won't be disappointed
not bad. i like it. quickly to make and send invoices. the worst problem is not possible to transfer data. need small improvements ..
. awesome app
. this app is not working with samsung note 9
major problems with the newest update!!!. the app was working great until a few days ago. now i cannot receive payments on my iphone due to a bug in the app and i also cannot send an invoice via email on my iphone or ipad now. ☹️
excellent app.. simple to use and very affordable.
. sales orders need sales orders! those are our work orders. please add sales orders 43013 still incomplete without sales orders. we are a service based company and sales orders our are work orders. need this addition please. thank you, white pines electric inc.************************************* 91713 still no sales orders! still no sales orders! *************************************************1142014
business owner. could use more features and customization on forms and invoices. some basic functions are missing. otherwise helpful. would recommend for a small business.
. i have trouble logging in the app won't let me it keeps saying my password is incorrect and i've reset it so many times and nothing works.
getting better. i can't live without this app. is not perfect but getting better. thank you for the improvements.
useless. this app is useless because if you have an online account with mac or pc you cannot use this app on your ipad! save your time, don't download it.
simple to use on the go.. really liking how simple it is to use & track things.
. i don't usually write reviews, i always dread using the app. i have a lot of receipt that i need to add to expenses. it's a big effort to find the right transaction and add the receipt. it's painful to juggle between banking transaction and expenses. if usability of the app doesn't improve it's enough for me to pay extra and move to xero.
love this app. works great and i can navigate and make invoices and track everything in one app! i love it
awesome app. it's very user friendly and informative. i really like how easy it is to assign an expense category and the convenient display of the profit  loss feature.
"app now totally dead, cannot login at all.. can't login anymore, giving a weird ""suspicious activity detected"" error and refuses to login, running android 5.0. works fine on my pc, osx laptops and ios devices. this is a known problem on android. see this https:community.intuit.comquestions1281477cannotloginmobileapp. still can't create purchase orders on android or ios! that's almost a deal breaker for me. i can search for items while creating invoicesestimates in android  but not ios?"
best business app. very quick, no bugs or errors. love it!!!
. this app works really good makes owning a service business simple. love that i can get done at a customers house and send an invoice
quick books makes my life easier!. doing estimates and sending invoices is easier then ever!
the phone app is practically useless. the phone app is very awkward to work with. the only think i found it useful for was just to look things up for reference. it's not worth taking the space up on my phone for that. i'm deleting.
. awesome app, everything and more than expected
nice. nice software
. quickbooks technical support is very bad and technical support dont know about how to customised form of bill and showing in their theam but donot show in my bill how to solve it thay don't know ..... and my network speed is 5mbps but opening quick books need time 10  20 minutes to open ... i don't recommend any one for supscription or purchase .... this is a overall very slow software
. you can't edit invoice style, and the web version isn't any better. i constantly have to switch between app, website and desktop. the settings and controls aren't easily accessible.
great app. i am running a smal business llc for a tattoo parlor, great app for even simple tasks. definitely worth the money, and i wouldn't use anything else.
easy. easy to use, and has all the features i need to run my lawn care business. i recommend it to everyone. my only issue was getting my subscription paid for. i worked it out by calling customer service and they were awesome.
. didn't get any customer services after emailing them.
so messy and confusing.. iphone app is so messy and confusing. desktop version struggles so much to gather my company info, and there really isn't much. errors out all the time.
. superb app
design and functionality is poor. the pin code doesn't work. i have to refresh data most of the time. crashes a few times a week. trying to edit description or client info is a pain. here is another update ok the app. it says clients have paid invoice on my phone when they haven't app is frustrating to work with.
awesome!. fantastic app. as a freelancer i am often away from my office. being able to create estimates and have my clients sign them on the spot has been great. and being able to send invoices from anywhere has absolutely changed my life! love it.
. this app is horrible. why make something so bad? it needs a complete overhaul. i can't email receipts to an inbox, income transactions don't show gst amount like expenses, i can't view pdf receipts. it's just all round ugly and cumbersome and i've only used it for five minutes. i thought the xero app was bad but it's 5 stars compared to this trash. deleted.
works well!. this app does what i need it to do. i'm an electrical contractor and i'm able to do all the bookkeeping myself with just a little help. i like the ability to make invoices on the job, enter receipts at stores, and view the status of customers. i would suggest this for any small business. i use the basic service ($10mth) and it's well worth it.
great app. extremely easy to use and has made doing my accounts a much easier and enjoyable experience! would highly recommend!
editing chart of accounts. i love everything except for when i'm editing my chart of accounts. when i go back to upload pics of receipts, fix categories and dates the phone app on iphone crashes. it's been doing it for several months. i have passed on the information, updated my phone, updated the app to no avail. very frustrating as it's an integral part of accounting for my small business.
quick books. this is very easy to use and it's great. with my iphone, ipad and mac, it updates any changes made and works great. thanks it is made invoicing easy
terrible. bank wont link and keeps failing, sending invoices and not getting paid as emails are not being received by clients i'm off to get invoice2go see how that goes i don't have this time for all this mess around
charge for an expense???. can't even include an expense on an invoice. rubbish !!!!
. pretty good app..
great app!. super convenient to track all my business transactions on the go. recent updates have made it much easier and more features are accessible.
awesome. this app is great and extremely helpful with my small business. it saves a lot of time and work. not only do i find it very resourceful but it's easy to use. customizing my invoices and estimates is probably the best part of the application aside from it allowing me to check my profit and loss. i recommend this app to any user, especially a business owner.
easy. i have found this app very easy to use. being able to tap into your invoicing system when out on a job. it enables me to issue an invoice same moment the job is finished and emailed to my customer stood in front of me, that way my customer has a paperless invoice and can pay you right away. saves time!
horrible. crashes every time. horrible customer service. move on to another app.
. he querido utilizar la versión pro 2020de prueba y ha sido imposible utilizarla, ya que me pide un código de activación el cual no aparece cuando introduzco la licencia de prueba..
. easy on the go invoices
"app now totally dead, cannot login at all.. can't login anymore, giving a weird ""suspicious activity detected"" error and refuses to login, running android 5.0. works fine on my pc, osx laptops and ios devices. this is a known problem on android. see this https:community.intuit.comquestions1281477cannotloginmobileapp. still can't create purchase orders on android or ios! that's almost a deal breaker for me. i can search for items while creating invoicesestimates in android  but not ios?"
does not intergrate with the desk top versions and is way more expensive. i bought the desk top version because i was told the app would work with it. now they are discontinuing the app and forcing users that need mobile access to use this, but it does not share data with the desk top version. it would not be so bad except that i bought and paid for qb for windows 2014 and is substantially more expensive in the long run.
some quirks but overall a great app. love the ease of running the office portion of the business on the go. this app is very easy to use and manage your customers and your business.
many bugs. need to fix bugs that cause the app to not follow the regular online access. employees can see things they shouldn't (like business income) and are unable to do things they should like entering customer info and invoices.
loved it indeed. this app works the way i think, i'm considering useing it in my next business. thanks
. awesome app that assists me to carry out my personal finance activities
business on the run. quickbooks online with the ios app make operating a travel based business on the run simple. log invoices as you go. input estimates along the way. print and mail or email all at once at the end of the day. not to mention the helpful reports and expense management. i couldn't run my business without it.
doesn't work for ipad. this app doesn't even load my company info. it keeps returning error trying to load company info. i have contacted quickbooks a number of times and all they say is they are working on the issue and to use a web browser version in the mean time. i have seen about 4 updates released and not one of them has fixed this issue. when will this be fixed?
. this app helps me keep my clients in order and helps me to keep up with payments.
crashes often. this app goes from being usable to worthless on a whim.
complete garbage. does nothing but give me an error when trying to sign in... fix your crap qb! followed your instructions to uninstall then reinstall.. still does the same thing...
. good app works good it saves allot of time, go payment should be integrated into the app
great app. far easier to use than desktop quickbooks. great software
search. the search feature needs improvement. can only search by customer info. can’t seem to search for an invoice by keywords that are in the invoice.
ipad integration has gotten much worse. there seems to be no way to run a detailed report. the help section is worseless. i’ve used qb for 20 years and it seems less trouble to learn another app than to continue. why remove functionality that used to be there?
. not able to login to app since one month now.
. lot of functionality easier than web or desktop app.
. very useful app
business saver. great for onthego business needs. allows me to create invoices and send to customers for immediate payments. everything i need!
excellent. the app is a great supplement to the online version when i'm on the road. i easily make customer invoices, add expenses that i have purchased. nothing is lost or forgotten. great way to keep everything up to date
works great, most of the time.. when it works well it is great, and that is most of the time! of course it isn't perfect and hangs up or doesn't update sometimes without explanation or reason. overall worth using though as i do often.
qbo app. very good indeed!
a1 app. i love this app ! i'm using it all day !
"qbo is getting better. after learning qbo and using it for the past 2 years, i can say it is slowly improving as a software. it infuriated me in the beginning. and it still can be cantankerous at times. it is also not as robust as the desktop qbs. but it has slowly gotten better. now i kind of ""get"" qbo and find it useful. please continue to improve it."
works well. it crashes and freezes every now and then which is annoying but it usually works very well. it's a very helpful app for my business
. excellent app
. disappointed!!!! what i need is the ability to download and accept new banking transactions, while on the go. having that ability would allow me to spend only a few minutes everyday updating my books, versus having to sit down at a computer to do this. please add this functionality to the android version of qbo. i can do it on the mint app, but not qbo for android : (
. the app has been having system errors & technical difficulties since january. why? my credit card is still being charged monthly fees and the product that im being charged for isn't working. your system is broken & flawed. please cancel subscription and refundcredit my card back. i would really appreciate it. i'm not interested in speaking to another rep. refund...
been perfect for my business. qb has helped keep me organized and professional while growing my agency. expect for minor tech glitches which are minor inconvenience it's been a perfect tool!
. poor customer service. substantial amount of time wasted trying reach a human.
. super slow load time and sms verification not working. it's a joke.
. very useful app.
. excellent, but doesn't show activity for the vendorscustomers. a rather significant bug.
. i don't seem to be able to login with google. is this supported on the mobile app (android), like it is supported on the website?
. good only good for invoicing. no way of viewing financial reports via this app.
. worst app website will not open properly in mobiles and ask for reset repeatedly for same user id, useless
needs to be full featured. i love the program but hate that i can’t do into my vendor bills on the app for ipad. i can’t enter them in or view them on ipad. i can on browser view but even it needs to update as everything gets cit off in chrome and when you click the menu button to hide it it does not slide everything over so you can see more.
great app overall. great improvement to the app. can pull up a lot of information on demand. still need some better viewing of bank register on the app. also need to be able to click on expenses in p&l to drill down into the detail. still a great app, but areas to improve.
great for handyman businesses. qb is great for me! i run a handyman business and my office is at my clients place or in my truck. i can sent estimatesinvoices while i am on site. it so nice because i use my tablet or phone when i’m on the road and when i’m home i can use qb on my computer and everything is automatically updated
useless. takes too long to add a simple expense.
quickbooks. really hard to get online started i'll write another review when i get it started
. since the update can't add trips for mileage. app was working perfectly before the update. app won't allow addresses to be added like before. why not just leave well enough alone?
great app. the app is great, love what quickbooks has done. but please update the widget, it's worse than terrible
great app. fantastic app. does everything i need to run my business on the go.
ridiculous omission. i can not believe that with all of the updates that you still can not create a purchase order with this app. ridiculous.
super simple. i love this app! so easy to take pictures and attach receipts to my transactions, send invoices, take payments, sign docs... very easy and simple...love it!
great mobile app. allows me to take my business anywhere.
roofing company. the app is great, although it needs an update with bugs fixed. the app won't allow me to modify, save or send invoices. very frustrating.
help. the android app is very very slow it takes a long time to change a estimate to a invoice i have emailed support several times about the issue with no reply please speed it up.
. the cloud accounting system that actually is intuitive and has good app!
. great app, much easier to invoice customers.
app crashes. since the recent update i can't get past the login page before the app crashes. makes doing work harder. what's next?
unwanted changes. we pay for the service, yet intuit dictates changes to our invoices that have doubled our paper use as well as anger our customers. you make the changes without any notice or options to do otherwise. nasty, mean dictatorial behavior!
does not work. quickbooks will not let me access via my mobile device, neither through my browser or through this app. figure it out guys, smart phones are the most common computers people use these days...
. i love this app! makea my life easier:)
thumbs up. great addition to the online software
. great for you business. i love how i can quickly add an expense by taking a photo of the receipt as well as logging payments on the go. its awesome that you have your data right there at the touch of a button.
great app!. i already loved qb...the app makes my business run even more efficient and allows me to pull up customers bills on the spot or estimates where they can sign. very convenient.
just that little extra insight into what's going on.. really enjoy the overview access to invoices(my transactions). helps me to better manage what deals i have actively running and what's gone overdue. real estate agent.
. great app. makes paperwork a lot easier.
. been using this app for almost 5 years. cant think of working my buisness without it!!
tops. i've never used any accounting software or accounting apps in my life & can honestly say this is the best! if you type 55378008 into any xl column & turn your laptop upside down it spells..boobless! 😄
great app. the app takes a bit to get used to but once you've played with it a bit it's very simple to navigate, update bank transactions and so on
can’t create multiple companies. can’t create multiple companies or entities with this program. i would have to pay a subscription fee for each company. if i wanted to track my individual expense, my business expenses, and my llc expenses i would be stuck for $720 a year when the 2013 version on my laptop could create unlimited companies and only cost $300 paid in full.
. very miss leading and is nothink like the tv advert. not to easy to use and over all disappointed. having to use it because of my accountant. no impressed!!!!
great app for managing your accounts.. great app, would definitely recommend it.
. why this app is not in french ???
. really nice accounting app. loads of integrations via desktop browser. even a desk top app that i suspect is node based. the best feature which is lacking in other accounting apps is transaction memos. that £200 i lent my mate in july is useful info when you look back a year later.
nice and easy to use. i have try this app. as a startup owner, it is very good to generate estimate & invoice
absolutely inconsistent. probably the worst app i had on my phone. i have deleted it. it gives incorrect, inconsistent notifications. it’s completely useless to access certain parts of qbo. how incredibly unfortunate that intuit can’t build an app that can compare with the advances made in qbo.
simplifies. this app makes it really easy and fast to manage receipts and expenses.
. malfunctions on every level. did not attach a single receipt picture to the transaction. brought in the bank accounts and scrambled them. even on the desktop deposits are expenses and you cannot edit them
great and makes things easier. the best thing about quick books is that they have unlimited live customer service to help guide and assist you. that's a real plus to me.
good and useful. chamuka
a & e blue dreams inc.. excellent app. i like it....
wow! loving the switch!. it's more than i had ever expected. using square or other solutions or good old fashion checks in the mail are nothing compared to how seamless qbo has made my life. that mac app, ipad app, iphone app and even the apple watch app give me the pulse on our company that i've needed for so long. can't wait to grow into more solutions with qbo!
. excellent app. crazy versatile. love that they supply a basic reader free of charge. lots of ways to accept payment. input expenses so you can write them off for taxes. nice. stoked to use it.
working great, love dashboard. app is easy to use on the go. some things are better done on desktop but for the most part can do a invoice from phone and accept payments.
you need to purchase one per company. if you own multiple companies this software may not work for you. unless you rather pay double and in my case triple for each software per company. highly disappointed and no one that would solve it. regretfully invested.
"problematic app. upon originally downloading this app i was pleased. for the first 24hrs. i was impressed. then, i ""sent"" an invoice which the customer never received. next, it failed to update or sync with my account. when i attempted to update manually it chronically reported an error sighting that i should check my internet connection. frustrated, i uninstalled and reinstalled the app. now, it doesn't stay open for long before saying it stopped unexpectedly. i've reported every error without receiving any feedback."
new to quickbooks. i decided to switch my established business from square to quickbooks and so far i have no complaints. it’s fairly easy to use. the only thing i’m currently waiting on is for my transactions to clear and be deposited which takes about a week since i’m new. should be a breeze after that.
". was great, while it worked. like the previous review, on a galaxy s9 i just get a blank dashboard and cannot enter new expenses. so the product has no use. not very impressed with qb's ""we're working on it"" response. this should have been basic testing done by the team, not by paying customers."
works and convenient. easy way to enter sales and expenses. i've had no problems with this app.
keep on improving!. hope that when using finger print to log in the crashes will subside. in addition looking forward to the mobil versions looking and acting more like the desktop. don't get me wrong... i do feel that there has been substantial progress but i'm looking forward to not having to drag my lap top.
. signed up 6 days ago for self employed package, although it says in the package i can use the app, when opening the app it states i have not signed up for it... emailed asking for help, no reply. scheduled a call back for tuesday 13pm, noone called. poor customer service. i will cancel and find another accountancy program.
love it. i'm no doing anything super sophisticated but i love the app. easy to use to keep invoices and expenses current on the go!
. the app is not updating on my phone
made my job way easier. been really useful for creating invoices and collecting payments for our company!
owner. great app
good on the go. it’s easy to make invoices on the spot for customers and receive payments. i still prefer sitting at a computer but this app really helps while i’m on the go!
. amazing. intuitive. simple to use. love it.
it's scam don't download 19.99 per month they took from my account. i just did download almost 8 month ago this app they took from my account almost 19.99 per month after cancel also they are robbing very bad don't download at all even no customer service to help you to talk also bad bad super bad
scam!. this app won’t let you unsubscribe. forgot my password and tried all ways to access my account, but they won’t send me a verification code in my phone. i have exhausted all efforts to change my password and log in, but to no success. i reached out to their failure of a customer service representative, didn’t help either! scam!
3 stars. doesn't do everything i would like it to do but overall pleased with this app.
. rubbish interface, doesnt send invoices when you press send, had multiple invoices paid late due to this, will be looking for a decent online app to run my business. how can an invoice be overdue if my customer never received it because the app sent it? how do i tell if my estimates have actually been sent? its extremely unprofessional having to contact my customers and ask them if they've recieved invoices and expenses because this software is not up to scratch.
improving phase one detsiling. awesome app to help budget and keep my finances straight. the one feature that i love is how our customers are not only sync online on our computer but also our iphones and android lg tablets. that is priceless
does not work with ios13. does not work with ios 13
very convenient and up to date with technology. i love the ease of bookkeeping using this app. a perfect complement to my accounting software.
. terrible. my bank account will not sync and support refuse to contact me. no transactions show up other than the ones that appeared the first time i downloaded this app. definitely not worth paying for the full version.
. well after the experience so far it's great when i need to merge all apps at home then i can rate better. customer service has been just awesome so far. thanks
"a great tool for accountants. this online version for my phone & ipad has come in so handy to check client info on the go...as well as categorize waiting transactions while i am out and about. i still use the qbo version on my laptop for ""major"" work. but being able to see things while i am out of the office is super helpful!!"
nothing works for me. nothing works for me with this app. if i login using desktop, qbo is ok but when i use the app, there is no information; no clients, no invoices, nothing. the subscription says i have a free trial until 2037. phone support was unsuccessful.
. i just downloaded the latest version of the app and can feel a lot of the improvements! it had some issues in the last version but seems to be working perfectly well now. this app is crucial in managing my business!
crashes. it now crashes. tried several times. updated everything. looked at website  no help. very disappointed, we pay good money for this.
wonderful app!!!. couldn't sing the praises high enough. i run a small, single member managed llc and the quickbooks online app is everything i need. i can create and send invoices and sales receipts on the go, even have the customer sign right on my iphone or ipad.
still needs delayed charges. if you can add delayed charges to the available transactions, it will be perfect.
amazing. east, fast and quick to learn. highly recommended
love this app tho. 😘👌👍👏😊♡✔
. easy to use when on the go. ability to take pictures if receipts makes keeping up to date on expense reconciliation a snap!
. i'm a small business owner and for me finding this app has been a blessing. this app really helps me manage my expenses as well as keep track of my inventory, employee payroll can be done as well etc. just really easy to use and having the profit and loss tracker is just awesome. so far i'm loving the free trial, definitely will subscribe once trail is over.
why use the app when you it lacks the features of the website. you can’t change the status of in invoice on the app and must be done online only. this is a major flaw in the app. once i do my taxes i will no longer be using quick books, because of the enforced complexity the system is rendered mostly useless. the app needs to have complete functionality of the site.
. they said in your invoice that you can cancel anytime and it's not true! it has a glitch and i couldn't cancel it. make me lost two days trying to cancel it and then even charge me the month and did not give back my money. they went from 17 dollars a month to 40 dollars per month! don't never quickbooks
not working after ios13 update. updated to apples latest software and this app stopped working
great for small business. tried 30 day trial. can't wait to purchase! love the ease of doing my daily paperwork.
stopped working on samsung galaxy s6. never had a problem with the app till about 3 weeks ago. it stopped working on my samsung galaxy s6 for no reason. i'm a small business that's on the road a lot and need to be able to send invoices on the spot. please fix it.
. almost 2 weeks now the app has not been working. the dashboard is just totally blank. im having to take a toptop to work and tether off my phone.
. awesome app
multitasking?. would be nice if app supported multitasking.
blair. app is extremely unstable. every time i need to get on it i have to force quit the app and re loggin. i have an iphone x and it runs horrible on here. hoping they fix this asap because i run my entire service company from the app
. love using app
most productive app. using this app on my iphone and ipad hs made my life so much easier! i've been able to invoice my customers without having to lug me laptop around. truly an awesome app!
quick and easy to use. so much quicker and easier to use then getting on the computer!
. superb app
. great app
will not export from pro to online. after 4 days working with quickbooks support they were not able to merge my company files over. very disappointed!
easy and convenient. it actually made recordkeeping fun! and i can stay current instantly from my truck.
. love this app. life has gotten so much more organized and business transactions so much easier
payroll done quickly!. love this app!
. as a small business owner it is very easy to balance the books and to get paid within the same app.
does what i need. app is easy to navigate and has all functionality i am looking for.
quickbooks online is great. i love being able to add expenses while on the road. i appreciate the snapshot of where my business is performing. it is great to have a record of what’s going on!
great app... needs some work.. there’s no way to record a sale without attaching a customer to it. also, there’s really not a place in the app to keep a ledger. if it had these 2 things, it would get 5 stars from me, but as it stands i give it 4.
. trial no thanks $12.99 per month, no thanks one time will be ok but not monthly
. last night's update totally messed up our county taxes, forcing you to use an incorrect rate, less than the state and county expect. we will need to use a different system now do avoid tax issues.
app crashes in ios9. this app was working great before the recent update. app just crashes when i try to open. i use an ipad 3rd gen running the latest version of ios9. please fix!!
delaware business owner. kingdom building services kingdombs.com makes my job ten times easier and gives me a professional image when billing my clients and it also gives me more time to focus on my business.
very helpful business tool. small construction business, i can do all my basic bookkeeping at lunch hour with this app
update make app worthless. thanks for the update that prevents me from sending invoices.
description is misleading. there is no way to enter or see expenses in this app and of course no way to attach receipt pictures to these expenses. you can enter expenses using computer and attach picture of receipt there, but not in this app. if you need a plug in to do that, why not to say so? or just remove missing components from description.
. good app very nice and handy
. sorryest app i've had. cannot even log in.
app is satisfactory  quickbooks online is not. i am very unhappy with quickbooks online. if you are anything more then a landlord of one rental property, then you will find quickbooks online to be greatly underwhelming. it is clunky, glitchy, and virtually void of any mechanism for customizing the program. it is not a replacement for quickbooks desktop. perhaps after a few years of unfortunate beta testers abandoning quickbooks online it will get better. for now, though, don't do it.
. disappointed...like horribly disappointed! this was supposed to make my life easier but instead i lost multiple hours either trying to figure the desktop version out to then trying the app and the tax rate were getting doubled...while chatting with help desk to be told that it would get fix a week after still didn't fix. uninstalled to try to start fresh to realize the price had gone up! chatted again with customer service to be told someone would contact me within 2 hours...still waiting!
ceo of gd2k. this is a really good app it has help our business in so many ways. it help boost our profit margin we have been able to close deals, and make invoices right on the spot. i recommend this for a lot of different business with quickbooks online.
excellent online software. i love this system made my job a lot easier my phone is my office
sucks. stupid
please add more search options. this is a great app to accompany a great service. my only request is that i be able to search for content within invoices themselves. for faster lookup!
great app. very user friendly. easy to edit and add customers.
quickbooks. it's great for making estimatesinvoices tracking inventory. .only problem i have found is it prints out like a letter that could be a setting i have missed, would like for the print out to actually look like a billinvoice
this app is awesome!. very easy to use and very helpful for my small business!
can't edit customers. you can make new customers but once one is in there you can't edit them unless i go to my pc
it's better but still missing few essentials. why are we unable to create bill. one would assume if we can create an invoice we should be able to create a bill as well
could be better. it's good for entering payments, that's about it. and even that is a stretch because half the time it shows invoices are unpaid in the app while the desktop accurately shows the same invoices as paid.
crashed when entered a sales transaction. downloaded this app to see if i could use it instead of at a computer and the app crashed as soon as i tried to enter a sales transaction. i tried to enter in the receipt type and it crashed
awesome app!. really useful app!!!
great. great app, great software all around for my small business!
"update broke the app. since the update i have to type my password each time i open it after it has been closed for a while. this doesn't work in front of customers. (yes, i enabled touchid. the problem seem to be hitting others and is based on now intuit decided to ""fix"" touchid by breaking it in this version)"
. entered in info 2 link bank business card. then i went & made a purchase with that same card & nothing showed up. giving apps a shot, even though i know in the back of my mind that anything can be hacked. i'm not trying this again will uninstall.
needs purchase orders. work in the construction industry and the biggest nightmare is a po system. you can create them online but this app does not allow for po generation which is a huge draw back. if this could be added in it would be a 5 star but till that get added it's very limiting.
difficult to use. makes it harder to run your business not easier.
. its a great app.
simple and great on the go!. a simpler version of quick books online, not all the functions are available but it's very user friendly and does what i need!
". this app is trash, has me very upset won't let me add a bank account just keeps saying ""hmm connection error"". this is bs i just signed up for this service and won't let me connect your app sucks and most likely will seek a refund. have tried wifi, mobile, what the funk, not quick in my opinion..."
. won't let me unsubscribe to the app so stuck paying a monthly subscription for a service i don't use. there's better completely free apps out there.
. ok app
great app. it's a one stop accounting app for me and it's made my life so much easier having it.
. worst billing app i ever had.. they give false promises before subscribtion. once the customer transfered money. no body will respond for our problems
this product is fantastic!. i will be recommending this to all of my customers. it's simple, easy to use & fast to set up. in fact it may feel like you've missed something it's that simple! intuit have put together a great product for the australian market.
great app. love this app!
superb!!!. this is a great app for keeping up to date with accounts. links to my bank accounts and intelligently matches transactions and remembers previous matches and entries. certainly deserves the name quickbooks based on how quickly i can enter my bank transactions. great for multiuser access and very easy to set up. overall this is much better than i expected.
great app. the quickbooks application allows me to quickly see my bank accounts, profit and loss statements, balance sheet, invoices etc.
great app. i've been using this app since starting our business last year and i don't know what i'd do without it. i love the program. when i started the business i had no idea how to do anything, but this program is very straightforward and makes running our business a breeze. you guys replied almost instantly and now it's working for me again. that's awesome. thank you! i don't know what i'd do without quickbooks. highly recommend this for anyone with a business.
highly recommended. it saves me a lot time from working on invoices and so. it help me on whenever i need it, i just have to take out my phone and i'm able to use what i need to.
take me back. new updates are awful. keeps crashing..unable to do simple functions on the go such as editing invoice, sending a statement, etc. old version was much better. change it back to how it was..not every update is a good update. especially not this one.
quickbooks online review. no longer works on nexus 6p. intuit support unableunwilling to help.
iphone app switching companies. thank you so much for adding the ability to switch companies without logging out!! more likely to utilize iphone app now on the go 😊😊😊
. excellent for a busy contactor. easy to send quotes and invoices to clients.
. amazing app
i love it easy to use !!!!. easy to use and easy to navigate!!!
poor compatibility. online version does not work with safari. quickbooks refused a refund stating it is not there issue. avoid and just get a good account
. as stated on my previous review,, i have tried every method including the ones quickbooks suggest and i still cannot find an unsubscribe button anywhere, this is very frustrating and ironic in the fact this app is ment to save you time, i spent half a day trying to unsubscribe to this with still no joy , last result to phone the number which does not work over a weekend.
simple. makes my life simpler. bottom line. easy to navigate. easy input. i prefer the mobile app over the website. i wish that u could set default categories for vendors, such as reliant defaults to utilities.
great app for accounting on the go!. i don't know why people are disappointed in this app it's an app, not an entire accounting software. plus it's free! i love this app. i can create, manage & send invoices on the go. that's all i need to do. it has a simple interface. kudos to qb.
. why can't i see bank account details in the app? you can on the ios app contacted help desk who couldn't help! without access to accounts the app is effectively useless. i have done everything you suggest. home screen is now blank! so even worse than when i started. i have also contacted support with no solution as yet.
convenient accounting app. super usefull app, get you at the top of your finances, recommended!!!
. works well. can create invoice and estimates on the go.
. this is a great app and has been an invaluable tool for me to manage my business. the only draw back i have found is when i tried to use paypal in conjunction with the app. 1) the cost implications and 2) getting the money to my bank account. this is not a quickbooks issue but it just caused me a headache.
. in usable black screen comes for a long long time in start up and during usable on android. the worst party is that issue has been there since ages. it's like qbo is not interested in developing this app
touchid?. would be nice if app supported touchid since it will not save your password and logs you off automatically.
great app. live this app, makes running a business easy.
good app. it does ok in a pinch. certainly easier to search transactions on a computer.
quickbooks online app. although i do like quickbooks online, the mobile app version is horrible. i downloaded and logged in and it did give me my balance sheet, but said i had no expenses, i could not find a way to put in a journal entry and other reports showed zeros as well. i deleted it from my ipad and will just use the nonapp version ( which you need google chrome vs safari to work properly not a big deal but a bit odd).
. doesnt support android.
. great app
great help. i love technology.
. fairly easy to use however it could be smoother when you enter new transactions instead of having to go all the way back to the drop down menu.
fix finally now i can get back to work.. this version fixed the errors from the last update. glad it working again. quickbooks has been good except the last update. this one fixed the issue. we us this app for our onsite business and it's great. several times i would send an invoice to the customer when i'm leaving their home and before i get to the next job it's already paid. update. does not work again. :(
online version need improvement. the online version specially on ipad is very difficult to use. if the could make the ipad version like the desktop version gui it would help. the app is a little unstable because of the cookies and the background history that doesńt refresh the actual data timely. overall, it is a decent product they just need to make some tweaks.
great app. i've been a qb user since the early 90's. the app keeps getting better with greater functionally. i'm confident that all functions will be available on the app in future release. i use this app all day to create estimates and bill customers. it's great.
. easy to use & productive... few features of the webpage version are not available on the app such as print or downloading packing slip, can't prepare a purchase order, etc. but overall, the app is helpful. thanks.
asim hussain. loved the life
. not sure why i pay $16 a month for this app when it only works 60% of the time. please get the bugs worked out or i will have find another company to run my business with. cant access my account on tablet, cant save invoice or estimate on s8. please fix.
. extremely user friendly, customers love the on the spot invoices and ability to sign for and pay for work right on the spot!
great. great app for on the go use
easy to use. not too bad need more bug fixings
"it was good no it's just horrible. i used to be able to update my invoices from my phone and now it just locks me out. it also used to show when customers viewed my invoices but now it keeps saying ""it might not be up to date"". after 7 years with them. i'm going to find a new pos at the beginning of the year."
easy and convenient. would recommend.
qb online. tout ce qu'il faut pour la pme. facilité, mobilité, flexibilité! un support technique accessible, compétent et rapide.
. worked fine until they updated the app, now does not work at all, can't even find my account, worthless
. great app the only thing missing is the ability to enter a mileage report.
they discontinued this app. do not download this. they stopped the link so it no longer works. too bad because i was using this to run my business and now i'm screwed. i have to find another app quick to do my invoices with. i like razorsync for scheduling but i am not thrilled with their estimating and invoicing. if intuit had kept this up and just made some improvements it would be great!
. great accounting app. would not be able to run my business without it.
. emailed 3 times now would be nice to get a reply as would like a refund due to canceling my subscription in the first 30day free trial but have still been charged for it. sent a email to the reply i got and since then got no reply again.
. great app
. this app is easy to use, once you get the hang of it. i can take pictures of all receipt which makes it easy to keep track.
perfect. i can't speak for large business but for a small business like mine this app is almost perfect. the only thing i need added is a milage manager for vehicle use. i love it, my tax guy loves it, what else could you ask for.
. it a great accounting program. i just wish you could do more from the app with out having to go online
. easy to navigate! great app!
incomplete and not easy to use. privacy settings are lacking as they previously were in the online version. to be useful, i need to be able to pass the ipad to a sales associate sioux giving them the amount of access they currently have (with the limited privacy settings). also, the login and password system is cumbersome meaning it isn't quick to open up the app to charge a customers card (faster to run it through the online version)
needs lots of work. very hard to use app. many options are hidden or unavailable so you are stuck and wind up doing the work through a browser instead
working great. app is easy to use on the go. some things are better done on desktop but for the most part can do a invoice from phone and accept payments.
great update to already great app. the latest update is great! being able to reconcile through app is awesome. best accounting app out!!!
. app is pretty good.
. really like being able to send invoices and estimates out in the field.
very useful!. great functionality!
jamie clarkson. makes running my construction company easier than ever before. don’t know how we ever managed without it.
. very slow. app doesnt update automatically. i have to manually update which takes forever for a relatively small number of changes to be downloaded. quite disappointed with it.
very good. one of the best way to do estimate and invoices highly recommended
. convenient i love the convenience of this app.
presently surprised. i really did not want to move away from the desktop version i purchased, back when that was a thing. however, i am really enjoying being able to create invoices, collect payments, etc. while on the go. so i suppose i will get used to this payasyougo thing ;)
. amazing this app can be difficult to get used to, like ensure you use docx to make your templates,and don't use bold ever.. setup your email template etc etc but it ends up being the best app ever.. it's features on the mobile app for invoicing, balance's, incoming and outgoing, tax digitally, are so convenient. i am organized now, and everything is handled for professionally.
not industry standard software. this is a clunky, disappointing, entry level piece of work. qb has been available for many years and i cannot believe that, having been recommended to download by our accountant, it feel like it has barely reached beta testing level. a real pity that microsoft money is no longer supported. that’s how to put a piece of software together. i have littleno confidence in the product.
invoicing. i use quickbooks as a means to invoice customers and collect deposit for jobs. for me it's worth it. it would be great if you could get a notification that the customer has decided to pay by credit card should you need to adjust your estimate.
. still waiting on a transaction from last week. was told a lie. biggest mess i have ever seen. stay away from go payment . now it seems they kicked me off quickbooks from this bad review. way to go quickbooks
. utter garbage. i use the online version daily, but the app barely functions, is laid out differently, and doesn't have any of the major features that i use online on a regular basis.
major flaw. the app ui is pretty good and i really like the interface. the problem is that a lot of my invoices are not even viewable on the app. basically anything that has a delayed charge on it won't show up so there is a major glitch there or something.
poor functionality. constant crashes inability to complete selected tasks poor functionality this app try’s hard but doesn’t quiet make it with its functions. it didn’t at all shot me but that’s what the 3 day free trial is for. i wasn’t going to rate this app but after they charged me $10.50 for a 1 month subscription after i cancelled and deleted the app; i will rate it
ios 13; don’t do it!. if you need this app to work correctly do not upgrade to ios 13 yet! many bugs... my worst bug: can’t look at any customer info anymore, does not work. yes i uninstalled and reinstalled...
. very miss leading and is nothink like the tv advert. not to easy to use and over all disappointed. having to use it because of my accountant. no impressed!!!! also no english call centre's! you can't understand the customer help line team as there english is poor. needs english call centres employing english to overcome this problem!!!!!
. this app coupled with the web based app is the best thing i have seen for small business. cut book work down to an hour a night rather than 3. the ability to send both quotes and invoices on the go saves hours. works extremely well with the paid web app happy as with both
. this is of great help! i can update our business transactions anytime, anywhere! thanks! 😊
excellent app.. simple to use and very affordable.
do not switch. if you use tradition quickbooks, do not switch. you will be very disappointed with the lack of simple features that are standard on traditional versions.
great app. love the flexibility it gives me!
. haven't been able to access my books since early september, can only use desktop app, browser and mobile app gives error message. contacted support 4+, engineers are working on known problem...10 weeks and counting
. love it!!! works great with the online site, as a business owner this app is very useful.
still waiting for receipt feature to work. i have made multiple inquiries about the receipt expense feature not working and they haven't even responded let alone fixed the issue. this has been happening for over a year.
. app gets crashed while working, statements can be printed downloads like web version. what is the need for inapp purchase for this app
hassled. having a negative experience trying to connect bank account. tried the right credentials and still not getting anywhere. waste of time.
. very good program, other than the price has went up 3 times this year.........getting expensive.......started at $12 a month and now at $25
everything i need right from my phone. so handy to be able to do estimates, invoices, and record my expenses right from my phone! will save a lot of time with bookkeeping as now i can enter everything on the go.
. the app sucks really bad, it's full of continuous bugs and it is unstable, every time you try to add attachments to expenses the app freezes does not save and shut down, find another solution because it's sad.
. user friendly app that makes me very efficient in my field .
useless. why even bother with this app? i can enter a bill from a sub or supplier on the website or the mac app but can only enter paid expenses here? i can do everything i need to do with my business on my iphone without carrying an ipad or macbook air except use the quickbooks app to enter or actually pay bills (only able to record bills already entered as paid). please fix this (or just tell us you’re not fixing it) !!!
great app. it's quick and easy to learn. prefect for me.
". 6.10.19  i hate it. you can't do ""billable"" expenses from the app. you cant edit invoices that have been sent. terrible. i hate it. 8.12.19  still hate it. noone has ""investigated""my situation. 👎👎 12.5.19. yup.. still hate it. i use it but cringe every single time i open it. pos app. zero stars"
new receipt identification is much worse. the new version of the identification of receipts when taking a picture to upload to an expense is much much worse than the previous implementation. this version hasn’t worked accurately once in 30+ pictures, whereas the old version worked accurately 90%+ of the time. how does this stuff get through testing...? :
pretty good 9 months in. really good, can't do pay roll or vat reports on the app but just about everything else. photo receipts for expenses and checking received payments. very useful. f
expenses. how can i add a credited amount in expenses? in the qb online mobile apps??
. it's an ok app, tends to crash here and there.
great app. i am running a smal business llc for a tattoo parlor, great app for even simple tasks. definitely worth the money, and i wouldn't use anything else.
not good after update. used to send invoices via email through my phone android before update cannot anymore. called customer service told me to uninstall and reinstall still same problem.. had to buy an ipad in able to send invoices :( horrible!
perfect software for the right companies. i absolutely love it! i have a small freelance design company, so i'm billing for services and commissions. there is nothing i need that it doesn't do and do well. i don't need inventory, estimates or payroll, so this program is about as friendly to me as it could possibly be.
some what happy. quick book is useful however, it's use is not as user friendly as it could be. the extra time it takes for me to have to identify items and upload others takes up more than i care to.
love the app. excellent app just wish you guys would add the ability to turn on quantity while leaving rate off in estimates and invoices
. love the receipt scan
the best!. i can't live without my quick books app! better than paying hundreds of dollars for an accountant
". mobile app is full of bugs, recent ""update"" has now made it so my account is unable to sync and wont let me log in. not very useful for my mobile business. tried reinstalling the app, still no luck."
where the banking. i want to accept transactions while i sit in bed, this app is far from useful without that capability, come on intuit, make the app complete. as is, a total let down!
. horrendous support from the philippines. works well when all the feeds are set up. just horrendous getting to that point
quickbooks makes it easy. quickbooks is one of the biggest reasons my company has hit tremendous growth. online invoices and payments makes my job literally a thousand times easier.
useless. all i want is to do, while i am out and about, is enter my expenses and take a pic of the receipt and sync it. not even close to happening with this app.
. i just need it to do invoices with 2 taxes and it seems to work good
. useless app. waste of money. lousy support. subscribe at your own risk. i am cancelling mine
can't imagine not using quickbooks!. so much easier that our previous accounts package. so many apps and addons you can build a complete solution what ever business your in.
. making my life so much easier!
not a good app. too many bugs.
. still using this app. still easy to use, still like it! great for what i need.
exactly as described. it does what it is supposed to. i am a longtime user of the desktop version and still do, however for a fledgling small business that is mobile the online version is incredibly convenient.
great app but could use some improvement.. this is a great application to have access to while on the go. if it would update the profits and losses more accurately than i believe this would be well worth 5 stars. overall a great app.
. the green box you have to put your receipt in is every where. the box won't stay the same size no matter how still you keep your camera.
. quick books is a wonderful and helpful program. when i have questions i am assisted by technical support team.
so much better. intuit have certainly listened to there customers and have massively improved the app with some recent updates. so much better and easier to use than before. well done intuit finally glad a huge company has finally listened to its customers
very good for business!. quickbooks is a great app for managing the everyday finances for my business that i just start. no matter what is a small business, this is the right one.
. worst customer support ever i write email to contact for support they say it's for global support then again i write email to india support they send me to us supposed.sad no response from the company first they sell at 4500 then next week its 500
. best app for business.
a good portable quickbooks app. the app has most of the important features, is easy to use, and is certainly a better option than trying to use the quickbooks online on an iphone. it is not a complete substitute as there are several features not available on the app,but it does allow recording time and expenses while on the road and even allows checking on and updating bank balances.
love it. great app, couldnt do anything without it!
. this app has never worked on my phone. it gives me the login screen, i enter my password, and the app force closes.
. great for running a small business in my experience
thanks for adding banking! now add more control over additional users.. i have been waiting for you to add banking and now you've done it! this is by far the best accounting app i have seen. now i would love to see you add more control over additional users, and a google calendar integration for scheduling.
waste of time. i paid for the app to get the discount, spent an afternoon inputting information and suddenly it wouldn’t save anything. logged out, rebooted, problem still existed. uninstalled app. on reinstall, the system didn’t recognize my login and i couldn’t access any of the work i input. apple has my $$$ though!
. started using it a week ago... so far so good
ahhh. you cant pay employees on the phone or tablet app. its hard to find the login on a normal desktop and when i want to pay an employee the employee section keeps going blank and never loads. this is extremely frustrating!
awesome ap for a handyman. emailing my client the invoice or receipt is effecient and impressive. being able to enter expenses when they occur saves me office time. only fall back is i cant yet enter store charges.
. i am using quick books since a weak very happy with it as of now the help line is also quite good they will help me to solve my query or doubts then and there problems faced so far is there is no sms options and sometimes waiting time for my turn in the helpline
glitchy, incomplete features, and poor data. this app needs serious attention. after years of putting up with this hot mess i’m fed up and rarely use it any more. no matter what i do i can’t get data to load that is any more recent than 2016 for most vendors. no one from tech support replies  ever. american express transactions can’t be synched or approved in the app. about the only thing it’s useful for is matching typical transactions in our checking account.
. if you have a service business and you hate writing up invoices, this is an awesome app. helps you keep up. if you have internet, you can send invoices anywhere in the world at any time
needs more work. how about an already paid check box ? also an option for tax inclusive default would be nice. it would save half the time making an invoice if it had these options.
worst customer service. i love the idea of the app but it’s too confusing i don’t get a lot of the options and customer service i barely understood anything was no help at all. i just simply needed the app to track incomeexpense and personal pay.
payroll app in uk?. just started using quickbooks and finding it fairly helpful so far however i really need it for payroll, will the payroll app be available in the uk?
. freezes often and takes ages to recover
. sending invoices from my phone is super easy and i love it.
. doesn't actually show invoices or customers. features are mostly broken or sporadic. using the website is a much better option.
. great app and easy to use!
. very good, i am on trial not sure how much full experience will cost, i'll update when i can
very happy. i love this app for my business
. crashes again and again
great for mobile small business !. we couldn't live without our quickbooks online mobile app! look up information and match bank transactions right away. would like to see more functionality for customer and vendor invoicing and billing options as well as filtering but overall a great, easy to use tool.
mr. doesn't work on ipad pro or iphone. it says my subscription has expired. i have had it for several years and it still works on macbook but on ios it thinks i am on a free trial until 13th april but still locks me out saying i need to update my subscription. it is useless to me if it won,t work on ipad because i photograph all my receipts into the app. will cancel subscription if it doesn't work soon.
great!. it is a very useful app however i am doing various kind of trading and i can't find a category that suit my need.
refresh invoice?!?. trying to add new items to existing invoice with partial payment received and won't let me save changes! refresh invoice means what, exactly? without this function why do i need my subscription? made office work harder as now must go submit through pc and pray that works...
almost perfect. please add the ability to print or download packing slips from the mobile app. everything else can wait till i am back in the office. sometimes a packing slip must be done in a rush. mobile app is useless to me without the packing slip feature.
simply functional. app makes invoicing easy, and allows you to track any outstanding receivables. should make tax time much easier.
quickbooks. quickbooks has been absolutely amazing overall. main issue is customer service and their ability to provide customer support for the app. i was required to ph 3 different numbers, one being out of service. once i finally spoke to csr he was extremely friendly but did state they haven’t been provided proper training to assist with app related issues but would do his best to help. i would upgrade to 4 or 5 stars if they provide a user friendly option for support.
. i can see my subscription for months. click to manage subscription and i am told i have none. haven't used thus app but have been paying for months. help
no customer support. this is potentially a great app, but customer support is nonexistent  3 emails sent and 2 weeks waiting for a reply to a subscription issue.
invoice menu. filling in spaces for explaining what the invoices for not easy to apply.. design poorly.
. hated it and when i tried to cancel it took them 20mins and had me on hold. i do not reccomend!
quick rip for me.. i find this app so frustrating and difficult. i have had it for nearly a year, paying for the services i can't even use. i have been trying to cancel it but there seem to be no option on the app. the website is asking me to trial the whole thing again. i can't even call and talk to a person. hhhhelp. i need to cancel.
how did i run my business without it?. i do half my estimates and invoices on the go with this app. saves me so much time!
. ceashes all the time, does weord stuff with data, doesnt save lots of bugs on android
occasional early glitches with mobile overall v good. i use the mobile version and it's access to my phone contacts makes it really good. there have been a few minor glitches with support but this is getting better and better  so apart from the few minor glitches early on then it would be getting 5⭐️
not user friendly. it probably wouldn't be bad if i kept a spreadsheet handy while i was away from my computer so i could reference invioce and estimate numbers with addresses. it kind of defeats the purpose though.
very easy to use and good app. very easy to use and good app
mrs. app will not open after update
. very user friendly app.
user friendly!. this is definitely the bookkeeping app for anyone who is not attuned to being a business owner
good app. very detailed , im no pro @ accounting but i am teaching myself this app. its very in depth and i like it.
highly recommend. i highly recommend this app. i run my business with quickbooks online and use this app daily. i use it to create estimates and invoices mostly but also look up look up costumers balances and run reports.
. really help full
introduce me to accounting. i love the app, it's giving me a good idea on what accounting is about. i'm kinda looking forward to take this course in the fall :)
great app. the app is easier to use than the online version on a laptop. well done.
. why can't i accept payments in the app anymore?
not sure yet. too early to rate this app. only second time me using it. ill check back in a couple of months with a more thought out opinion.
. doesn't work on my dell tablet. called customer support in january and they said software glitch should be fixed in two weeks. it's been two months and still not working!
update google signin never works. update: quickbooks support contacted me. i uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it works now.  i have tried and tried to get into the quickbooks app using the google signin. i get it to work maybe 1 out of every 50 times i try to login. i don't know why they haven't fixed this issue yet. i always end up logging in on my mobile browser instead. fail
new update sucks. latest update for android takes forever to refresh and save invoices. almost unusable for me when i'm on the job. takes over five minutes to save an invoice and then even longer to print one if will will even let me...tried to uninstall and reinstall and reboot and everything it still takes way too long to refresh and save.
"what are you thinking qb???. when you send invoice or proposal email, it doesn't come from your email but from ""qb do not reply email address"". so if customer wants to email you back with question or addition they have to start new email thread."
. great app. keeps all my business expenses in order.
fix the bugs. this program has many bugs and has connectivity issues. the level of problems with the software is extensive. when the program works correctly it works nicely, but the downtime and glitches greatly degrade the value of this software. i would look for an alternative accounting software package. i do not know anyone who has used this software that would give it a five star rating. in other words, i am very skeptical of the rating shown.
new version stinks. one of the main reasons i use the app is so that i can pull up my customers entire transaction history when i'm out in the field. the previous version did that beautifully. other problems as well.
so amazing!!!!!. this has made my life so easy with estimates and invoicing.
excellent app. keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
two thumbs up!. have only been using for about 30 minutes and has made my business 1000x easier!
it’s 2018. it’s 2018 and still no turbotax integration or automated receipt scanning integration. you still have to manually enter all of the receipt data. if this is about “streamlining” small business time then make things streamlined. no new advances or major improvements in the past 2 years. im in the market for a new system.
good app but. it’s a good app but you should be able to mark invoices as paid and deposited via the app. my paid invoices are regularly, incorrectly shown as unpaid. i have to wait until i have time to go on my laptop and mark them as paid via the website
. improve ur app i clear all my data buy in app its still coming
changed my rating to 5.. i used to upload all my account transactions from this app. now they are gone. that was the only thing i used the app for. it is now useless to me. ***update*** your suggestion worked. changed my rating.
google auth broken. can’t login to my account using google auth.
. very hard to work with didn't match up with my phone or my tablet.
cannot hours for. it verified my account by text message, and had my phone number on file on my account. won't let me use it because i don't have an account..?
. mobile invoicing, categorizing expenses, pandl, ect. powerful. get it to save money and sky rocket efficiency in business. sooo good!
app constantly glitches and it's very slow. i've had so many issues with this app. lately it has been extremely slow, it randomly shuts down for no reason in the middle of inputting a transaction and it won't load larger invoices. i'm very disappointed as i use this on a daily basis for my business.
great app. user friendly. simple and intuitive!
. if this app doesn't work in india why do showing many ads popup and videos and why did you uploaded on playstore india platform
i’m loving quickbooks. quickbooks makes life so much easier! thank you so much!
. great app trying to start a small business this is very helpful thanks
all but useless. i love qbo but the app is useless. it’s like a completely separate universe where nothing shows up as set up in qbo. reports are limited and custom reports aren’t there. i can’t see something basic like checkbook register.
great little app. excellent app for basic book keeping invoicing etc and keep up with the book keeping on the fly. but to do the serious stuff you still need to work from a laptop or desktop.
. having the app makes quickbooks that much easier. now i can write invoices on my phone no matter where i am at. time saver!
doesn't work. app crashes on load and while logging in. pretty useless so far. :(
update to the update.. they fixed the update. i updated my rating.
. very limited features and too slow. even after 6 months of using they've not provided the payment gateway integration as available in others. no one handles the queries seriously after 5pm on phone call.
love the added functionality. i have been using quick books online since it was released. they continue to listen to customers and improve their products. the app is great and can't wait for even more innovative functionality.
it's a pos. i wouldn't have given it a star at all. you can't tell if they person paid you or if you just accidently out it in as a payment. it's hard to use,hard to understand and honestly i lost 134 dollars in sales because i couldn't figure how to use this thing. i'll be using the square starting tomorrow
unsatisfied. keeps telling me to contact support after trying to make an invoice very frustrating.
projectivity. great app for my consulting business. once you enter your data quick books can show you a picture of what your business looks like; where your money is coming in by customer. instantly produces reports, reminds you if you have invoices overdue and can be linked to your bank. what more would a small business want? i love this bookkeeping program. :)
great app. love that i can get estimates approved right on my phone!
. does what it says. great for invoicing on the move and tracking payments due
great small business tool. very easy to navigate and enter information. i can enter data on my home computer and then access it with my phone when i'm not in the office. great app
. apparently i don't know my password or id, yet i just used the exact same login details to login on my pc... level of angry right now is fairly high
. gr8 app
i love it. i'm. to sure why all the negative reviews unless intuit has just improved that much i. the past few weeks. i've not had any issues not seeing changes made in the ipad version vs the full online version. the only limitation i've seen is the inability to manage inventory levels on the ipad but i'm sure that feature will be available soon enough!
great software. great affordable option for small businesses. this software is incredibly helpful to ease the stress of being an entrepreneur.
love quickbooks hate new limited invoice styles update. love quickbooks hate new limited invoice styles update
prettt good. it’s a good app, i’d have given it 5 stars but the sequential number doesn’t load when using the app. this means to produce an invoice you have to go back and look up the last invoice number.
this app is useless on android.. i can not believe that this app is this bad. i can only see customers invoices that i have been to in last 2 months. i use to be able to see 10 years worth of invoices. please fix asap. unless you can carry a laptop at all times which is not practical this again is useless.
. force closes all the time. when it won't stop doing it, i have to uninstall and the reinstall. complete bs since i pay for the service.
". made an payment 3 days ago and still getting an error ""subscription error"" ereceipt sent. update, it's been 5 days and i'm still locked out of my account after payment was made. quickbooks has offered to transfer payment method directly to them. google play informed me that quickbooks refuses to refund my subscription, while quickbooks denies that that is the case. fyi been a quickbooks user for 3 years now, and never had an issue, til now."
qb app is useless. i’ve been quickbooks user for a long time and discovered this app gives a totally different set of numbers than quickbooks online does. expenses are different than real version so please beware, you can’t trust the numbers. contacted support to no avail. i guess they don’t read the other reviews either.
. please update. can't login
. makes my life a lot easier... if i could only use this app while not driving down the interstate.. so what, who cares if grandma gets run over by a reindeer, i gotta get paid today..
love it. love it. the version on my computer is great. this app is a little unintuitive but if you understand what you're doing it's not bad!
excellent. the app is a great supplement to the online version when i'm on the road. i easily make customer invoices, add expenses that i have purchased. nothing is lost or forgotten. great way to keep everything up to date
a handy little companion but it wont replace the website. a number of features from the web portal are missing such as matching bank transactions but its ok to use simply to check your chart of accounts and to record expenses.
i spoke, they listnened. i have had my fair share of frustrations with intuit and when they send out questionnaires i answer them and my biggest complaint was no access to a p&l which is now apart of the app. it's perfect for what i use it for and there's nothing like creating invoices and getting paid on the go. great update and thanks for listening.
. use qb for all my book keeping, estimates and invoices.
vital for biz. makes it simple to analyze business from your phone.
it’s having to log in constantly. i’ve been having a really problem with my ipad six generation lately, anytime i exit the app while writing up a quote and bounce backandforth between the information i need to enter into quickbooks. the app suffers a critical crash causing me to login several times with in an hour span. are there any bug fixes coming up? i suffer the same issue with my iphone xr and ipad pro.
business owner. this is a great product ! i don't know how i would keep my business organized without it. also customer services is awesome. this is a must have app!!!!
terrible app. you are unable to view and use the register, reconcile accounts and other simple everyday banking tasks. logging into your company through a mobile browser, such as the google chrome app for ipad, does give you access to some but not all tasks. isn't the purpose of online banking to be able to perform all banking from mobile devices?
. perfect to make invoices on the road however missing important functions like sending customer 'statements.
great app!. very userfriendly and convenient. great for people who are needing to create invoices and estimates and track expenses. the iphone app is fantastic!
very slow. this app is very very slow.. 10 minutes to load , another 10 minutes to load customer screen, and 15 minutes to apply 1 payment
. amazing app for business
changed my life..!. qbo has made the bookkeeping side of my business a dream. it has given me so much time back. if i forget the rest my business to run as smoothly, i would be a happy man…
". sucks!!! i've tried 8 times to sign up for the free trial & an ""error"" always pops out... :p"
great app, very useful and always improving!. this app is the greatest tool in our businesses ability to streamline work, easy to use.
export. does everything i need it to do but can't export your data on a mac. also crashes in ios 11 beta but not holding that against them since i'm using beta version of ios. works find on my phone using ios 10
. qb desktop has a far superior user interface i did not realize that this is not the same program
getting better but a long way left to go. we switched to quickbooks on the recommendation of a number of accountants. then we realized that quickbooks online and the desktop offering are worlds apart. the app is good, but not great. the entire qbo experience is frustrating and getting support is difficult.
not helpful. this app doesn't help me. i get errors every time i try to match or categorize a transaction from my bank. it's useless for me.
needs a delete feature.. so i downloaded this for my business and decided to do a sample invoice and payment to and from myself. however i cannot delete this. i tested to make sure i could use this effectively before switching to it. without the delete invoice or payment option i am out of luck.
. when we process credit cards ti is showing the transaction being paid. however, it does not connect to gopay, even though we have that function turned on. we did not realize they were not processed completely until we did weekly reconciliation. as of today, this bug has not been removed. 3.8 on our other tablet is working fine.
invoices. i would like to be able to sort the invoices as they come in by day.
kerrie. herc's girl
very good for any kind of business!. quickbooks is great app for managing the everyday finances. it's very fast to send invoices, with this app all income and expenses are simple and quick.
quickbooks. if you use quick books you have to have this app. its a must have
. hello we want to use this software in india we have 5 branches under one company, i review your software but there is no location control for inventory system,we need all reports by branch wise and location wise is this possible, or if any alternative. please inform
. this app works perfectly for making and sending invoices, addingediting new items, reviewing bills, etc. i haven't figured out how to download an invoice as a packing slip...sometimes i need that function, so have to go to my computer.
overdue but great! gorgeous!. this app is way, way overdue, but at least they got it right the first time around. no it doesn't do everything the website does, but nailed, adding buttons (functionality) is the easy part. it's definitely one of the best looking apps on my ipad.
. switch to xero even though its more expensive. better off wasting money on a useless app. cant even save a transaction. lousy support and engineering team to not resolve such a essential feauture after 1 month. subscribe at your own risk.
fail update.. update never savessends invoices on either of my 2 devices
much room for improvement. if it were free, it's a great product , but as a paid program and app, it could use a good deal of user input towards improvement
it’s ok, but.... it not very useful as field service software. it’s painfully sloooow to use. even on the pc it’s the same. the software crashes when i need to use it or it’s syncing.
can't bring myself to use it.. it's nowhere near as useful as the desktop app. i'd love to be able to create an invoice on my phone or tablet and upload photos right from the device. can't do it yet.
. great app
okay. i'm new to doing my own bookkeeping and find this product clunky and not very easy to use. issues with importing transactions and program changing dates and the order compared to the bank. it's not very easy to see what account transfers are moving tofrom. it's hard to distinguish credits for debits. poor customer service. no good summary graphs. slow to attach receipts. multiple clicks to do basic things. cuts off file names if there too long.
. after some training it is clear that quickbooks is an invaluable tool for business. after using other cloud invoicing software who have either not covered my needs or have closed down i would hope that qb will be around for the long haul . downgraded by 1 star because the recipt capture isnt quite as good as another app i had .
great app. very easy to use. reliable. every once in a while it has loading issues but it's rare.
. quickbooks provides all we needs as a small business. their support is always patient and helpful.
missing too much functionality. basic features like looking at an account are missing. my chart of accounts are listed but clicking to view transactions says this account not viewable in the mobile app.
. convenient app. helps me keep up with my accounts.
very pleased. very happy
great so far!. i am really glad we went with quickbooks online, as i love this app! being able to pull up any and all financial information as well as build and email estimates and invoices on the go is crucial to our business! thank you intuit!
app not working on my phone. app is currently not even loading before it crashes. nextbit robin on marshmallow 6.0.1. sent error report weeks ago and nothing yet...
i was using quickbooks desktop. i really like using quickbooks online, especially like the synching, capabilities; it is much more convenient to login with any device.
awful. iphone app pretty much unusable in the real world. always wants to be signed in each time you open it, touch id feature doesn't work. today it's complaining the app needs to be updated before i use it, it then directs me to the app store where it shows i already have the latest version!
great app. works great for customer signature!
. missing cpl of features like cheque writing, arap reports in mobile app.
. tried to use it to review transactions, banking section is permanently glitched and won't load transactions or activity.
sign in problems. there should be a way to sign in without a password or touch id. for me touch id rarely works.
absolutely great  speechless. i can't believe that qb has gone this forward in app. really impressed with the features specially reconciling bank through app. what a great feature. very efficient  100% from me.
great app. builds accounting teamwork and keeps management decisions up to date...
great!!!. i love this app i love qbo what else is there to say. recent update created tons of issues with ios 9.3.3 some glitches evolved not sure who's fault but hope they get fixed. i appear to get error messages entering my expenses :(. can't save invoice created either please fix. otherwise when the app works it's great one star is its current state.
". the app will not sync to my quickbooks data. an error message appears. i am able to access my data online but not on the app. after 2 hrs on the phone with ""quickbooks"" i am left with ""we don't know"" and no solution in sight. i am a contractor and i use my phone or tablet to invoice etc. now i have all my accounting on quickbooks and can't use my phone or tablet to work it."
finally. i am now not as lazy taking care of the books for the business. as soon as a customer pays me i am able to record it and not dread the end of the month or tax season.
love the software. understanding that all software are more friendly on the actual computer than in the cell app, even though, the cell app is very helpful for invoices, estimates, reminders for payments “on the go” just to mention a couple of them. being an 8 years user from checkmark multiledger and payroll and making the transition to quickbooks is just a huge step forward and very efficient for my firm.
. love how easy this app make doing business.
simple, quick, the best!. simple, quick, the best!
great mobile app. perfect for my mobile power washing company as all my customers and estimates are available at the touch of a button no matter where i am!
last version have a lot of issues. since i got the last update, the app crashes a lot and its very slow!!
. very usefull app
. app crashes all the time
good app but.... i automatically give apps that force me to rate them a onestar.
excelente. es una app genial me a facilitado el trayecto administrativo un 100%
easy, fast and efficient. this app keeps me organized and on top of my cash flow. it is easier to use than the web interface and it's always with me when i'm on the road. as a mobile trainer, this is invaluable. once customers and vendors are set up, it takes seconds to update invoices, payments, and receipts. highly recommend.
brilliant app with loads of features!. so easy to use. so easy to learn. instant bank feeds. invite your accountant & bookkeeper & other users. so much support from intuit & the australian team. what's not to like? intuit have put together a great product for the small to medium business owner. thoroughly recommend this product.
crashing. since moving to iphone11 pro  the app keeps crashing. can’t even access it! please fix this as i have to upload receipts to my laptop to add to quickbooks! ain’t nobody got time for that........
great app. great app. can grab my ipad anywhere and do what i need to do.
. terrible. my bank account will not sync and support refuse to contact me. no transactions show up other than the ones that appeared the first time i downloaded this app. definitely not worth paying for the full version.
. this app is easy to use and keep on top of, all business activites are in one place and the calculations are done for you!
bad service. very bad service customer support team is bad zero star........
. how do we upload multiple files on app? thanks.
ios 13 crashing. app crashing after password screen , ios 13 is not compatible with this app at present , considering the amount my company pays for quickbooks i’m disappointed to say the least .
shwetha. super app
best for small businesses on the go. i'm a cpa consultant that specializes in accounting systems and qb and its other products qbo are the most popular in our vancouver market. it's popular simple to use, has good built in reporting, and lots of apps. and it's adaptable for virtually all small businesses.
nice, but not as good as it could be. great for staying on top of purchases. but, it's too cumbersome to move around within the app efficiently. needs to have the ability to post deposits and merchandise returnscredits from within the app.
loads of bugs since updating to ios 13. broken links. can’t call up customer information. dashboard only shows banking information. invoices and estimates haven’t saved when generated on mobile device.
effective. we love the fact that our company can work together from distant  separate computers. we really appreciate that quickbooks continues to upgrade and modify their program.the initial ( 4years ago drove our bookkeeper a little crazy) but each update makes sense and increases speed of system.
no complaints. does the job.
invaluable. i am a mobile mechanic and use quickbooks on my journeys to write invoices, receipts and estimates. i wouldn't be without it
awesome app. quick books is really an awesome app. links up to accounts quickbooks payments. i can access from all my devices. it’s really versatile. you can make great estimates as well. emailed invoices and estimates look very professional.
very satisfied!. been using the mobile app for the past 2 months now, and i can say it does everything i need. very easy to issue invoices, receive the money, match, reconcile the bank, calculate the vat! the support people are very helpful and have a lot of patience!
easy, fast, convenient. love using this app! it is really easy to navigate and lets me do everything i need to very quickly. always in sync no matter which device i'm on.
invaluable tool!. qbo app is invaluable for me as a small business owner. having access to all my funicular data, customer records and invoicing is fantastic! the app works flawlessly.
. customer service is absolutely horrible. signed up yesterday online. found out customizing invoices function has been broken for 3 months. call this morning to cancel subscription and get a refund. they're answer basically was we've got your money we're not going to refund it. you have been warned stay away from quickbooks
the best app for small business owners. i own a small business near austin, tx and i used to have to drive home to write up an estimate, but with quickbooks they have truely made it easy and extremely convenient. i highly recommend this app.
. love it. makes my life so much simpler. i own a dj company and for billing and keeping track of my expenses it works great! plus client service is a+
. does what it says. i'd recommend booking some hours with a qb approved accountant to get it set up right, once you've got it set up it takes care of itself. quality.
. great app helps my business run smooth and never miss invoices
basic app. app functions are extremely limited, and i can't use qb web on any browser on ios devices (ipadipad pro 12.9iphone 7plus) as all browsers including safari, chrome and dolphin run in zoomed mode when want to enter invoice, payments, receipts and bills or even check reports and make unusable.
. i would like to create, edit and update projects in the app. thanks
after 3 years qb stops working. spent hours on the phone with support. no solution. cannot add items to an invoice. i'm a distributor so mobile is pretty important. sorry qb pretty disappointed with your product.
. this app lags like crazy. i have a note 8 so it's not the phone. why have an app if the performance is poor?
crashes when downloading. crashes when downloading after initial setup. have not been able to use app. disappointing.
. it keeps saying check back in a few hours when i attempt to look at my bank transactions. very glitchy
. this app is rubbish. it doesn't do the single thing you'd think was necessary using phone camera to take photo of receipt to attach to transaction.
. great app. life gets easier.
. dashboard is broken!! loads but shows up blank. i can see things in the activity page but everything else doesn't work!! please fix this. i'm running android 10
awesome. that's what i said in 2012. the app keeps getting better, now it's very soon to be 2017, and still the same review.. good app.
. solid a love the mobility and ease of use for my small business. just wish i could void or cancel invoices and estimates on the app.
. useful on the move financial management.
. i can't receive payment directly to my bank account. somehow it goes to undeposited funds even if a choose cheque or direct debit.
. dashboard is broken!! loads but shows up blank. i can see things in the activity page but everything else doesn't work!! please fix this. i'm running android 10
very helpful.... there are some glitches with a couple of the features but for the most part, it’s exactly what i need. a great help for record keeping and invoicing my customers efficiently. there should be an option to select and send multiple invoices at once. i have multiple invoices per customer each week.
waiting for updates. quite frankly, it's been totally useless. the app does not sync new data entries with the online database. i've already spent well over three hours with multiple customer support reps. the idea of creating invoices is great....only problem....it does not work!!!
quickbooksjoist sync. none of this is working at all. for a company that does bookkeeping it’s ironic that i’ve been charged twice in less than thirty days for a trial period!! none of my invoices are synced, estinates are counted as revenue and quikboojs is stating my 90 day old business has 1000 net profit!! not even remotely possible! this is incredibly frustrating and so i have to work on this on my only day to rest. ridiculous!! do not use this app
fantastic for on the go.. customers pay me and i put it right in the app. no waiting until i get home to forget. love this app.
finally becoming useful.. new banking update is great, now just get it to work. very buggy and extremely laggy. you hit an item, then do it again because nothing happens, but it switches to the next screen and you end up clicking something you didn't want to. very frustrating. fix this and 5 stars. on galaxy tab s 10.5 running lolipop 5.0.2
easy to use. excellent app. very straight forward to use. the only issue i have is not been able to raise purchase orders on the app. this is very important to me because of the nature of my business, other than that it's spot on.
soooo convenient. being a small business owner, this allows me to access all of my customers on the road.
. horrible. difficulty in getting customer service rep. when asked to speak to a manager she continued to argue. not easy to speak to a rep. i signed in and went thru steps to set up quick books it didn't like my information to deposit money. horrible and don't advise wasting money. sat on hold for a manager for an extremely long time more than 15 minutes.
electrician. this is app for business
mileage tracker not working.. so far quickbooks support has not been able to get the mileage tracking feature to work on my phone. iphone6. won’t manually of automatically track mileage and wb support has not resolved or explained why. partial functionality is not good enough!
. very useful business tool
. this app is useless and doesn't work properly on a phone
. great app to have if you starting your own business, you need to have this app. you can keep track through laptop, tablet and phone. you can make it as simple as you like or as detailed you want to be! awesome!
. good overall very happy with this app. my only complaint is that my products are not listed by category like they are on the web based version so it makes it difficult to find items when creating invoices or estimates. the mobile site has this feature (but no option to create estimates), so hopefully the app could have it too?
. error code 132.100 quickbooks doesnt even have a fix for it. customer service has no clue as to what they are doing. i like paying for software that i can't use
quickbooks is wonderful. there is not a better software on this planet.
good app. haven't had a problem with this app.
app doesn't connect on ios 9. ever since ios upgrade 9.3 and quickbooks mobile app doesn't sign in, always says check internet connection. it's a bug in the app and they know it, we contacted support to fix it and they said they are working on it and will have a solution by end of may. this problem has been on for more than 4 weeks with no solution. poor app with poor support. not recommended at all.
great small business tool. excellent on a laptop, dient handel banks with authentication dongles very well, mobile app doesn't handle them at all. can't do payroll from mobile. receipt tracking is easy and works well. reports and snap shots handy.
fix it!!!!!!!!. when it works i like it, but when it flips out it is so frustrating. every time they update it it takes another couple updates to fix it. leave well enough alone!
awesome i just need to learn to use it. its awesome i love it but im new to it so i have a little bit of trouble using some of the features but im sure i will get the hang of it with time n experience
crashes when entering a sales receipt. i am new to quickbooks and am super frustrated i can’t enter a simple sales transaction. it crashes every time. disappointing
free trial. what free trial?? it requires a subscription to even open the account!!
. very fine app
great app. best app ever for a mobile business.
outstanding. i love the new quickbooks app it allows me to invoice and estimate my customers in a snap it also allows me to bring the point of sale in the home credit card processing is very easy also my favorite feature is that i am able to transfer my contacts into my quickbooks customer list with the press of a button
. it used to be a great app. but they even do not allow me to login anymore.... i did change the password so many times and did uninstall and install the app. now, i need to go back to my old iphone or lapy for my bookkeeping:(
best business app. quickbooks has definitely made running my business much more efficient and has made it easier to close on deals. the estimate tool makes it easy to send professional looking estimates to clients, and with a click, those estimates turn into invoices. you can receive payments through quickbooks as well. add the payroll service and you can run the whole business yourself. i would definitely recommend this to any new business start up.
. great app a bit overwhelming at first with all the features.
very limited functionality. the app has very limited functionality  i can’t even see the purchase ledger on the app never mind post invoices or take photos of them. lists supplier contact information only, not even account balances. useless. i have to log on to full site and try to navigate around it on phone screen which is difficult. oh and by the way, very unhelpful customer service too!
good so far. it seems good so far, will update later when i actually have time to form an opinion. it keeps begging for a review so here..
love it. just be cautious when trying 30 free trail. i loaded half a dozen customers and lots of estimates,invoices etc. and then purchased the 6 month subscription after i got familiar with software. well it led to doing work twice. because you can only have one or the other, free trail discounted 6 months subscription.
don't like new update. i prefer buttons actions on the bottom than puede corner and still missing two things, send invoices by text, fax, edit or view notes online
great app. makes my life so much easier!
it gets better and better. i was a huge sceptic (i have been a pro advisor for several years)and very had a very negative opinion of qb online. that was until a couple of years ago when i attended a presentation of the capabilities of the software. i was sold on its usefulness and have been using and recommending it ever since. qb online adds important features regularly. buy it!!! you won't be disappointed
waste of time. glad i haven't gotten past the trial offer because nothing syncs with my quickbooks online. so the obvious question is what's the freaking point of this app? completely unimpressed. someone's making money off of doing nothing. wow. i want that job!
new update has stopped my app from working!!!. since the update i now can’t accept anything or change anything!!! the only thing i can do it add the expenses!!!! sort it out please!!!!!
great. not perfect.. very useful program. could use a little bit of polishing though.
not nearly as good as the desktop version.. the idea is great but i need it to be able to update to and from my desktop version easily which is nearly impossible.
. great app everthing i need from quickbooks in one app
. great app. makes paperwork a lot easier.
quickbooks saves me time & money. this app has streamlined my business as i am always on the go. its easy, efficient and powerful! still missing critical features in international version such as online paypal payments
very good app. :)
new update crashes constantly. can’t login. crashed every time. have tried reinstalling without any luck. also, you can’t customize or get payment alerts for qbo except through the app. so until this is fixed, i’m stuck checking daily to see who’s paid and when. pain in the butt. please fix asap.
a poor mobile companion to qbo. there are so many things wrong with this app. for example, expenses have a note field that doesn't show notes entered in qbo (web). the length of the expense category field is so short that i can't distinguish among categories, especially nested ones. the app generally lacks the functionality it would need to make it a truly useful companion to qbo.
. its a very helpful app for businesses
excellent once setup. i run my whole business on quickbooks. it was a little tricky to set up initially but once my bookkeeper had given it the once over, everything was perfect. great stock management system that ties in to the invoices and hooks in with the business bank account. this makes self assessments etc very easy and saves loads of time. very happy :)
. great for business. keeps track of all your records. would defiantly recommend the app to everyone.
. horrendous software. awkward to use, not intuitive. massive outage when i have a ton of work to get done for my client's vat return.
enables my business.... ...to run smooth and accurately from monthtomonth, yeartoyear. managing multiple clients and accounts would be a nightmare without quickbooks.
good app, but could be better. the app is good but could be better with more functionality. for example not being able to add 'bills' but you can add 'expenses' a small change but would make the app much better.
customer service fail!. customer service is non existent look elsewhere
quickbooks. super easy to use! i was able to backlog and bring my business up to speed with quickbooks within a few hours after downloading quickbooks! operating the app is fun and accessible!
. handy but a little slow
. great app and can finally look at my invoices on the job.
dirty tactics for subscription. unsubscribing to this app is so difficult. an error prompt always appears everytime i process unsubscribing. but if it’s any form of purchase, upgrading, downgrading, anything other than unsubscribing works just fine. no reply from their customer service since i contacted them a few weeks ago. i hope other people who has the same problems with this app comes forward so this developer stops milking money from unwilling customers.
". would give 5 stars if i could put a message on an invoice or estimate; like ""work location"""
good app. very useful app when on the go.
. it needs customizable products and services. it updates to often.
hopeless. ever since my accountant asked to use it, the app is never able to retrieve any data keeps giving a message to say ‘unable to retrieve data’. what’s the point of the app if i can’t see the dashboard and data when i need to?
stuff always wrong or glitchy. seems every time i turn on quickbooks by pc or mobile app, something doesn't work! never buy online version, it sucks
made my life easier. i use to spend all weekend doing paper work and now i do it as i go in the car.
almost useless. if you are hoping for his app to at least somewhat mimic the full version you will be greatly dissapointed. basic functionality, like looking at a register or your accounts payable is missing. basically the only thing it is good for is looking at your accounts receivable.
. doesn't work for the last few months on any of my devices. called many times support and they said they are aware of the problem and they are working on it. this is insane!!! i'm paying every month to get the online version and it doesn't even let me sign in. it shouldn't take month to fix such a problem.
best way to handle your business needs. great app
. amazing app.
really good !. used a different invoicing program for years but would not sync with quickbooks. so i went over to the best and figuring it out. quickbooks online has made it easy to work through. good job developers !! been 8 months now and have to say quickbooks online has been excellent ! not too hard to learn and very easy for my customers. a winwin
. 1 star due to being conned by the sales staff. downloaded app and was offered 50% reduction if i signed up. next day get a call from quickbooks sales team saying they could offer the price lower for 12 months, signed up and looked at the offer on the app was lower. its a good tool but sales obv just want to meet their targets
don’t use the pay options.. app is great but don’t use the pay option. it took a week for the money to hit my account.
. tried twice now to add my bank account and no luck, keeps saying i'm logged in on another device but i'm not. been into online support twice now and they can't fix it so the app is pointless to me
. error message when i try to log in on my tablet. customer service offers little assistance after a long time on hold. this experience makes accounting for my small business even more unbearable. (update 11418): i dropped the review down to one star (from 2) because the error message is yet to be resolved on my tablet, three months later, and qb has increased the cost of their simple start plan by 30%. lame.
. this app is great. i can do everything from my phone. i'm can update at any moment and keep an eye on clients who are running late on payments.
confused. unlike using my laptop to filter purchases, payments, and deposits the app is extremely confusing and when purchases are made you cannot view them live or even see previous ones, instead i have to spend a lot of time logging them in. i purchased the quickbooks online through my laptop in hopes that the app would make my accounting easier by using my phone, as i do not have time to constantly log into my laptop. the app is too time consuming and confusing.
. nice software and easy way to learn.
loads of bugs since updating to ios 13. broken links. can’t call up customer information. dashboard only shows banking information. invoices and estimates haven’t saved when generated on mobile device.
quickbooks online. don't usually write reviews but this app is definitely worthy of a review. if you are in the market for an invoicing program this is the only way to go!!
. it's very useful
needs work & capability. for those of us that work on the road and try to reconcile books daily, do not depend on this app because it is nonexistent. no reconcile function whatsoever. i hope their team listens to our feedback because we can jump ship on any given day.
worse update ever. finally you eat our petition to add calculator to the invoice keyboard and removed on this update? app freezes a lot
perfect and time saving. now i can invoice my clients from my phone when i'm with them and i can classify my transactions each time i have to wait, directly from my phone!
. most of the times search for customers, invoice numbers, amount etc doesn't works. keeps on saying something went wrong!!! please get sortout this issue urgently.
does most. app does most of things i need for my business. one thing i am requesting for is the ability to pay with a daily rate not just hourly. i have a home care agency and this is how we pay our employees in some cases. lynn
always something hidden. is there possible to get something without paying, like an app that i originally paid over 200 ,now to have that app on mobile divece pay again,but on regular basis. why just make an app where i can sync all info at the office or home
. payment to vendors are shown as expense
quickbooksjoist sync. none of this is working at all. for a company that does bookkeeping it’s ironic that i’ve been charged twice in less than thirty days for a trial period!! none of my invoices are synced, estinates are counted as revenue and quikboojs is stating my 90 day old business has 1000 net profit!! not even remotely possible! this is incredibly frustrating and so i have to work on this on my only day to rest. ridiculous!! do not use this app
. great app
useless for bookkeep. cannot access chart of accounts or bank accounts so i can not enter checks or payments. this is of no use to my business. so disappointing!
vendor purchase no option. it takes so much time for converting the invoice to pdf for printing.
qbo saved my books. this app is a great extension to the desktop, cloud based program. everything you need in the palm of you hand and more.
. great app help me a lot with my business really easy to use on my galaxy s9 and iphone x
. you suck!!! i hate you guys!!!! you need a support phone number!!!!!
. great software. helpful for my business
unusable. doesn’t connect to my account.. every time i try to login it says there is no company associated with my account. it works fine through a mobile browser or desktop browser. the app is completely unusable, how convenient. tech support says there is a glitch...you don’t say.
glitchy. freezes regularly, can't send invoices quite often.
. good app for a start up business and it will grow with your business.
fantastic. i love this app! it's very useful
great. helps me track all of my business needs from estimates and invoicing to financing. great app!
great for mobile services. i'm a computer technician and i use this to send a invoice or estimate for clients. quickbooks has a brand name which is good when you email your clients a invoice, it looks very professional. the best thing about this app is the cloud base syncing of your invoice, clients, income and expenses. it's worth the money if you want good quality invoices for your clients.
game changer. changed the way i handle my business transactions. from a simple to complex my invoices and estimates are presentable, traceable and accounted for. my reports help me secure loans in a flash. and my accountant loves me.
. i've downloaded this app, uninstalled it, and reinstalled it and it will not allow me to create an account. it continually signs me out and i have to reenter all my information. i'm giving up!
. best accounting app i've tried, much easier than kashflow for example
no inventory tracking, no reminder. very disappointed with this no inventory tracking, no reminder for the app no not also for me its pointless quickbooks you better fix it i am cancelling my subscription
glitchy, incomplete features, and poor data. this app needs serious attention. after years of putting up with this hot mess i’m fed up and rarely use it any more. no matter what i do i can’t get data to load that is any more recent than 2016 for most vendors. no one from tech support replies  ever. american express transactions can’t be synched or approved in the app. about the only thing it’s useful for is matching typical transactions in our checking account.
tried them all. i persevered with other systems and intuit quickbooks online has been sensational since i migrated over. excellent adaptability, intergratibility and functional practical to use. very happy! keep up the good updates.
new to qb great program. i'm still finding my way around the system. but, so far it's been a game changer for my business. highly recommended.
problem with update please fix. iphone x, after updating the app, it doesn’t let me edit any transactions at all, i can only approve what is recognized transaction, an unrecognized transaction is not responsive to touchscreen commands so i have to cancel edit. please fix
. great app
. even though i canceled my subscription 1 month ago, it still continues to withhold money from me.
"divine couch. i'm running a small business called ""divine couch"" and quickbooks has helped me with the day to day accounting tasks like quotes, invoices and receipts, it's been a true charm. i would recommend quickbooks to all small to medium business owners."
quickbooks. this app is excellent and the version on my computer is even better save's me hours when quoting well worth the money.
crashes. the app just crashes as soon as it starts to load. don't waste your time downloading it.
opens the closes. after the last update of quick books i can not access it on my ipad. there for it is costing me money. i hit the app it opens the closes right back. i have uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it is the same thing. i have 3 jobs i did today that i could not take payment on because of this. please fix asap
. i like the app works very well in the field. can slide cards input data all from the work site.
garbage. signed up to their free trial, spent hours putting up my receipts only to be told i have to start again because of an error at their end. now locked out of my account and all my original receipts have faded taking even more hours trying to communicate with them to gain access to my account
. can't connect my bank account. please fix this error. i have to manually put my expenses in the app because when i try connecting my bank account i always get a pop up saying an error occurred.
. very user friendly
quick books online. good for customer data base. good for invoicing and receiving payments. fair at tracking expenses. near useless as an accurate or bookkeeping tool when linked to a bank account. so many obscure and poorly explained manual actions required that error is easy to introduce and tech support usually makes things worse. one may as use good old fashioned paper ledgers and a calculator. don't trust it with your numbers!
terrible wont setup after 3weeks. don’t even waste your time with this. they keep giving you barriers to setting up payroll and when you meet the criteria they inputting errors in your account. the end result is you paying for a service you’ll never receive
doesn’t work on ios 13. so many bugs:  can’t send reminders  can’t modify invoices ( reaching invoice number limit?)  can’t send invoices( email is too long? )
. streamlined very easy to navigate. really makes getting the job done a breeze
happy but need a little help on a question. i like the app. i can’t seem to get the job address or shipping address to show up on the invoice... it s a big concern for me.
loved it. does exactly what you want. needs more access to desktop features but generally great app
love it!. i am a locksmith, need an easy and efficient easy to manage invoicing, books, transactions... qbo has saved me hours every night logging and sending invoices, billing, and balancing my books through my bank. i send invoices on the fly now, and all of the related bookwork is completed simultaneously... seriously wonder how i found the time to complete everything this does for me from my phone or tablet in my car. a real time saver!
phenomenal. quickbooks app on my phone combined with the online system is the best thing to happen to my new small business. i no longer feel like an accountant full time & business owner part time!
cpa. i love this app! i can take care if my client s with my smartphone.
. used to work perfect ever since update it's very unreliable. can't log into app reliably. it often locks me out right when i'm standing in a customer's house trying to invoice them or locks me out when i need to go through my client list for a phone number etc. i suggest you consider competitors software until the app becomes stable again.
hi. app don't work
. i use this app for 2 separate businesses. is very easy to use and track all of my finances.
great can scan bills directly with phone. i use phone app instead of pc sometimes, as i can record bill right when i make purchase, complete with scan on receipt. awesome.
simple + effective. much better than the online and desktop tools available. super accessible, easy to use, and simple interface and controls. 55 stars.
poor. need to put password in every time i start can't write a service invoice and an amount
crash issues. this app crashes on the new iphone 11 pro max using ios 13. please release updates to resolve the issue.
wht and whvat accounting. great software, but requires improvement to include withholding tax accounting
does not even log into my company. installed the app, entered my login details then tells me sorry it cannot download my company details and to report issue. i've reported and typically the response i get back is to redownload the app???
unsatisfied. keeps telling me to contact support after trying to make an invoice very frustrating.
inventory. i would like to see quantity of my inventory on the app. please make this happen.
. all the hype and there's no where or way to cancel a subscription.
can’t use properly  soooo slow. i can’t use qbo app properly, the application is so slow, unable to load my data on my mobile (wifi lte network)
great for consulting.. works great to invoice customers while on site.
very useful and easy. love it
". update 101619: still useless as constant login issues persist, why use the app if i constantly have to uninstallreinstall + clear cachedata. constantly unable to use app  login, keep getting ""temporarily unavailable"" !!!"
bid sheetcost. it would be awesome if the was a template for a bid and not just an estimate. also, qbo is too expensive.
fantastic software !. this has made my life a whole lot easier. invoice and estimates on the go. i really feel in control of my accounts.
. i have not been able to log into the app. i keep receiving an error message indicating i need to install the latest version, but it is already installed. i even attempted uninstalling and reinstalling, to no avail.
excellent. this app is making a huge difference to our business management. real time visibility of important financial data! to improve, id love visibility of scheduled bills, plus ability to make part payments to invoices. terrific!
favorite app. my favorite app. i use it on a daily biases to send invoices right after i complete a job. makes my life so much less stressful.
game changer. totally transformed my business. really great software, so informative and nice community to support you. no brainer. can't believe i'm raving about accountancy software!
. inconsistent.. can't access my file through the app today. keeps force closing after authentication. not really good enough intuit!
existing customers badly treated. this company refuse to permit existing customers to switch to (the less expensive) simple start package even when they meet all criteria. go elsewhere instead.
. easy to use great app
garbage. this app is junk!! support for this app is useless looks like i will be going back to freshbooks, it may not be a accounting solution but at least it works and i can import my info without manually entering. my business doesn't have time for me to spend hours with support when i need to be taking care of my customers ms support
amazing app. wouldn’t be able to run my business without quickbooks. thank you for the prompt ios 13 update!
. made life easy! amazingly user friendly
quickbooks. excellent app, works great for my business.
function doesn't follow form.. 5 stars for functionality, subtract 4 stars because it's been 5 months and quickbooks still isn't optimized for iphone 6 or iphone 6 plus. the wasted space and bloated images are annoying; and the lack of willingness to adopt to new display resolutions makes me not want to invest in intuit products and services.
ability to do transfers. good app just wish i could do transfers between my bank accounts the same as the online version.
great program. great program for businesses. great for on the go!
. great app very useful
did you not test the latest update?. crashes on startup... please fix asap. i use this daily. this used to work great.
silly errors. there are a few silly things that would be so easy to correct. invoice design, and worst of all sending a customer a copy of a paid invoice shows invoice amount as 0.00. not the actual amount and paid.
this app is worthless. literally none of the things i routinely do with quickbooks is possible with this app.
ok... like seriously. i’ve used this app for 2019 mileage and expense tracking. but every week i have to reconnect my bank account. like every single week! why?? i don’t have time to do that. fix this! or i’ll be forced to find a better working service!
works sometimes. account synchronization works sometimes. paypal often stops working until i log out and log back in online. bank account takes days to update. not a great app. integration. integration needs some work.
. you have priced me out. i'm going to find another program. $40 a month is ridiculous.
disappointed. this app falls short. for one you can't see inventory. can't create po. can't enter a bill against a po. on the online version one cannot enter a partial bill against a po. cannot creat inventory level alarms. come on man!
the cost is not free. it tells you it free but when you go in to create a online account it states it is $9.99 a month which you can buy a program cheaper then that
better than tinder. good app.
. so far it is superb
. it's a good app, but much faster on ios than android. it's excruciating to use on android
. 1720 update  i had used the mobile app for android for quite a long time with no issue and then approximately one month ago after an update the dashboard no longer has any information and is blank. i can still see activity but there's no way to get to customers or any of the other functions. i've emailed previously with no response. previous review: works well for viewing quickbooks info and taking payments
great as an assistant to the desktop version.. i've found this app to be a great mobile partner to the full desktop (or online) version. there's a couple functions that aren't available in the app but everything you do need is easily available. i can't connect my bank account because my (non us) bank isn't listed but being able to input expenses as they happen is a great way of keeping updated accounts. reconciliation is a breeze afterwards. it's a great app.
. app is crashing as soon as it starts... 🙄 edit: app is now working, i wish all features of the desktop version were also available on mobile.
. great app
easy to use but missing some features. it's a great app but missing some features. i need to see quantity for my products and be able to create purchase orders from vendors and receive inventory.
keeps crashing. keeps crashing and doesn't track mileage for work and charity. really disappointing.
accounts. simple is the new smart
great resource. a little tricky to manipulate at first. but now i love it.
great app but missing some key functions. i've used qb online for a year now and its a great service. the app allows me to invoice and record pymts immediately, however i cant seem to enter expenses. if i could do that it would get 5 stars.
never disappointed. best accounting software available!
need ability to accept and categorize bank transactions. an app is supposed to make our lives better. all the bells and whistles in the world to date on qb app don't help if i can't sync my bank and credit card transactions while on the go. can't this be prioritized? surely i'm not the only user who needs to clear my banking transactions and relies on that for expense side.
love quickbooks app. very easy to use definitely recommend
love the new app. 5 stars
great. amazing app but whoever did that last update screw it all up. can save estimate or invoices. horrible. i hope they refund at least a month of fees because i'm loosing money having to do all my estimatesinvoices at my house instead. needs to be fixed asap.
. info lost. i was using the service for my business last year and started in march. in november the app crashed. when it did all my saved receipts mileage and info was lost. i can't even login any longer. when i called they said there is no support for the app except online. so i cant even speak to a rep. so all my info gone and i'm still being charged for a year and a half now for a service that never existed.
great  when it works.. app crashes often and has trouble down loading data
. works we so far. just started using it. i like that i can create and send invoices from my phone.
signing out.... ugh this app keeps signing me out in the middle of my work.. please fix this soon. 😞
. terrible customer service plinky plonky app. i have now moved everything over to xero which is much better
loving it. been hunting for a simple app for managing the finances of my farm business. this helps me with capturing and analysis of all my expenses and income. the reporting is also amazing. i also love the fact that i can even get more stats and reports via the web. amazing stuff. already introduced it to quite a number of industry colleagues. truly an amazing app
it’s great. although this program works incredibly well and i’m happy to of used it for the past two years… i would love to do an annual subscription, pay my payment once a year and carryon.
. easy to create invoices in the field
. after i finish a job i get my invoice right out to my clients, it starts that (30day net) clock ticking.
. android user app is convenient and easy to maneuver. i lile that i can remain productive on the go!
awesome accounting app. it's user friendly. moreover, tutorial videos are available if have any difficulty.
reports needed. need simple reports such as sales tally for a given day. unnecessary steps required for multiple entries, should use 'save and next.'
app crashes on ios 9 and ios 10. when i click on support it takes you to a web page that also does not work properly. do you have email support ?
great tool for those on the go!. while there is a lot of functionality missing that would make this app even more convenient, what it does offer is a tremendous help while on the go. from creating invoices to recording expenses to seeing your p&l and balance sheet, this app is a great tool and extremely easy to use!
bad update. last update renders the app useless
a++++. great program!!!
you can do better, intuit. this app has a lot of promise: utilize the power of an ipadpro and really speed up routine accounting functions on qbo. in reality, the app is glitchy, limited in ways it shouldn’t be, and effectively too flawed to use. i’ve been disappointed before by intuit, but this failure is inexplicable.
"error. i dont even understand why massage always popup said ""failed to connect with server"" when everytime tried to login using this app..send several of email to support team but theres no answer n solution..please do something i am a quickbooks online plus subscriber.."
how bad????. i would love to write a review, but as i've been trying to get this app to log in to my online account for 5 months now it's going to be a little difficult. but not as difficult as trying to get any customer support for this app. i could write a whole book on how impossible that is. so so disappointed. no help with this problem what so ever. frustrated!!!!!
great. great app i use it everyday, makes invoices a breeze and makes it easier at the end of the year for tax purposes.
great app. super friendly and sweet app
love😻this app. must have for small business owners.. or even for personal use. don't know what i'd do with out it. been using for 3 years now😊
having issues help. keep saying to restart app and i even master reset my phone for nothing. need help. very helpful when it worked
. makes it so much easier to get things done, while i'm on the go go go. it's a great help to my business.
"fees on fees. while the app itself works and is fairly handy, i strongly advise against quickbooks as a company. i signed on as a business owner for $6.95 a month and was immediately slapped with over $100 in fees hidden in ""fine print"". worse is the utter inability to get any customer support from intuit. i canceled my subscription and despite already paying for the month, lost access immediately and lost all of my records. then i got billed again. stay away."
update ruined app. since the last update you cannot run credit cards on the app. it crashes immediately when you attempt to. my business uses qb on 25 devices. all crash when taking payments. this has caused a massive issue for us and clients. beware of putting too many eggs in the basket of a company that can be sloppy with the interface they sell you.
best app for small businesses. i own and operate a small it consulting company and this is the best business management app in the world. i can literally walk into an office or home of a new customer, add their information and invoice them on the spot. no need to mail an invoice and wait days or weeks. not to mention its very inexpensive.
great app. great app, need work on making all aspects of it to work on a tablet.
very easy to use. this app is extremely easy to use and very helpful.
everything i need right from my phone. so handy to be able to do estimates, invoices, and record my expenses right from my phone! will save a lot of time with bookkeeping as now i can enter everything on the go.
. always displays an error when trying to connect to bank for transactions
"fees on fees. while the app itself works and is fairly handy, i strongly advise against quickbooks as a company. i signed on as a business owner for $6.95 a month and was immediately slapped with over $100 in fees hidden in ""fine print"". worse is the utter inability to get any customer support from intuit. i canceled my subscription and despite already paying for the month, lost access immediately and lost all of my records. then i got billed again. stay away."
needs some work. this app is good but needs more work. error message kept popping up while working in it. some tasks are missing like entering bills. can't find sign out button or switch to a different company.
. very disappointed this is a spotty business resource. sync issues. i entered a customer contact once and it appeared as a new payment in my activity tab. update: i have cancelled for other reasons. looking elsewhere. wish it wouldve worked.
better if had a progress invoice option.. almost complete, but not perfect. still missing progress invoices feature. i’m using 2 apps because i need that.
awesome app! totally enables business on the go!. businesses on the go!
. leaks your info to several malicious ip addresses. including facebook. sad but true. (no root firewall app)
. first of all i want to say that qb online is the best accounting software.unfortunatelly the app crashes on samsung s8 oreo.hope this will be fixt soon as is a shame,beeying such a great software.
. excellent app i can do all my business on this
app is good, online version great. i do love the ease of use of online version. however, i wish i would have access to bank accounts and credit card accounts on the app. please add these features!
. this app doesn't work! such a disappointment to say the least! i'll edit my review once the app is available for use! still not working! uninstalling for now! i hope that you fix it!
good. excellent app. some very slight issues with layout and the occasional page that can't be used on ipad. but overall good. would recommend to others
. makes my job easier.
". downloaded the app to be able to view estimates and invoices from phone while i'm away from my computer and someone calls wanting to know ""how much did we have in this job or that job"" well, the app is prettt useless when you have hundreds of estimates out and you're trying to find a particular one , but there is no ""search"" tool to look for what you're trying to find."
. quickbooks online has been great, downloaded this app to make life quicker when not in the office. however, for expenses i have found it unusable as the same payment methods i am using online are not available on the app and therefore it messes up the consistency of my transactions. very disappointed as had high hopes, have yet to test the differences whilst invoicing.
confusing. i used the trial a little while ago, and sort of went off it. just renewed the subscription now with the exact the same email, but quickbooks somehow created a new company instead! the support for backing up the company’s data is all over the place, since there are so many variants of the softwareapp.
. need to pay to use the app? why not directly put the price instead of stating it a free app?
crashes. app is unusable after ios 13.0 update.. crashes. app is unusable after ios 13.0 update.
great app. allows me to invoice on the fly. easy to get things done. i don’t have to be home to do them.
stopped recognizing transactions. after the last update it stopped recognizing transactions. even after the manual editing, still does not add them to my income. the same with the desktop app. the only difference is that the manual editing works on desktop.
great for businesses on the move. makes invoicing easier if not in office all the time ,
. better and easier to control. good job and well done to your team. keep up the good work!
. the support team helped with my expense logging issue. awesome!
quickbooks app. great, convenience of creating, editing and sending invoices and adding customers, payments or expenses
. this app takes forever to do anything. it literally takes a minute just to open after i tap the app icon. completely useless. information is not reflected correctly during use. just use a web browser instead.
. great app
"convenient. having a small business can be challenging...a customer requested a copy of invoice to be resent from my office.... ""i have no office"".....downloaded d app and baam, job done....awesome!!!!!!"
best mobile accounting app. great improvements in the latest version. easily the best ipadiphone app for accounting, that sits well alongside the full featured qbo software.
can't wait for more!. yeah, it's not going to be the only way you use quickbooks. but having the opportunity to have a mobile capability is immensely helpful. it's how you use it and when to that makes this app great!
only basics. the app appears to make available only the very basic functions. i don't see reports, and i signed on to complete some company preferences, add classes, and set opening chart of accounts. none of these are functional.
. buyer beware. you can't cancel your subscription online or through the app like you would with any other subscription service. you have to call them and play phone tag for a while if you decide that this service isn't right for you.
too many error messages. for what you pay for a quickbooks online account, this app for ipad and iphone is really disappointing. i get an error message almost every single time i try and enter a new transaction. sometimes it works despite the error message, sometimes it doesn't. but i get the error every time. i can't even access the banking functions as i get an error message and nothing will load. the only function that seems to work properly is the reports section.
excellent product. great for sending estimates and invoices on the go. everything i need to see right at my fingertips and very user friendly.
couldn’t be worse. worst customer service out there. pulled money out of my account when they made a mistake.
. love this app
it's just not the same as online. though the app does do most of the basic functions that you can do online it is still lacking some of the advantages to just doing it online. it is convenient to be able to access it on the go but it should be as versatile as the online version, also some of the menus are a little confusing on the app.
impressive for mobile. i posted a bad review because of some bugs. i received an immediate response about upcoming updates and a week later it was fixed. i love that level of support. nice app too.
horrible (the website version too). so obviously not developed or supported by anyone with any accounting knowledge as this is the least functional program i have ever seen.
". crashes too much. many times new customers and info can't be seen on the app, unless i uninstall and reinstall!!! i get a ""unable to refresh"" message constantly. it's extremely hard to enter new customers and revise existing ones from the app."
. i have been using this app for years to run my small construction company. i have never had major issues.
. usually apps
perfect for small businesses!. i have a growing cleaning company and thus app is perfect for me!
electrical contractor. we really like this app and all its features. it’s fairly easy. i gave it 4 stars only because it is missing one important feature and that’s appointments. it would be one less app i have to download into my tablet and computer. it’s just a suggestion that would be so convenient all in one( hint hint).
great app!!. this app helps me stay connected to my office while being out on jobsites. i can check customer invoices from previous jobs to see what process was done. great app.
down graded. from april this app is unusable. i down graded to qb online. it appears it was released about a year too soon. nothing but frustration from day one. the phone app is all but useless.
best business app!!!. i love using qb for my small business. love the auto reconciliation. professional looking quotes and invoices. it's amazing!!!!
. love the ability to create invoices immediately after performing service calls and deliveries.
brilliant. best invoice app i've had
crashes upon opening. do not install. keep your prior version until they fix this. upon updating the app no longer will open. i called quickbooks and they said it must be a known issue then.
easy. i'm now able to send bids to potential clients easily.
business. i'm very happy with this app help me a lot
great app. removed and reinstalled the app on my iphone. works fine
still needs some changes. multiple addresses for a company is still a drama as it changes all pervious invoices and quotes. plus now on the ipad version it says i can't access until subscription is paid but it is.. works on computer but can't use my ipad. annoying!!!
awesome. amazingly quick and efficient. very easy to learn how to use.
. does not open on my phone. crashed
negative stars  if possible. i find it amazing intuit promotes such an obvious clunker. why don't they just buy square and tie that in  or at least imitate it. intuit is lost when it comes to transactional businesses. at any rate  as almost all users point out here  this app is useless and should be an embarrassment to intuits development team.
. very slow app
. they just did a huge update and didn't change any of the items i'm having problems with. the app is useless to me with line items abbreviated. how do i know what i'm entering?
. another app failed to provide the timely support i needed. i have used quickbooks before and i am sure i will have a great experience!
worthless. qbo is great, but this mobile app stinks.. worthless. hopefully they can evolve this app quickly. qbo is great but this app ain't
i love it.. i run three business on it. 1. multispecialty physician group. 2. mechanical electrical & plumbing 3. physician sales & service. i complete my payroll and carry out all accounting functions here.
bugs!. so many bugs with this! i just rated it before and it’s popped up again asking me to rate. and i could go into so much more, however i’m only using this until next year. it’s shocking. i have just sent 3 invoices, the clients have received them, but they are not showing up in the app.
home improvement. great app
. if you even subscribe to their free trial, they will call you dozens of times in a day. its too much. every time a new number, so i can't get rid off. heavy spamming. जीना हराम कर रखा है यार तुम लोगों ने
. was working ok then app was updated,. help centre can't give time to fix or troubleshoot to be able to use this whilst out on jobsites not happy at all costing money
. signed on to the mobile app but it will not pull up the data for my business. keeps saying that there is a technical issue. have tried many times. no luck.
the best. buy an ipad. shred up your paper estimatesinvoicing. stop using pens. download this app. holy crap i've been in business 4 years and feel stupid after downloading this. plus u look awesome w an ipad. plus everything's stored forever.
. quickbooks is simple to use and makes the book work easy for myself as a small business.
updates that don’t install. first of all got up to install and it won’t
great tool. its great tool for small business. makes my life easier. recommend to everyone
qb online. this software is good but lacks shelf assessment options and the price is slowly getting to much per month. currently just gone up to £21.50month so time to look for a cheaper sole trader option
useless. all i want is to do, while i am out and about, is enter my expenses and take a pic of the receipt and sync it. not even close to happening with this app.
love it. i love the quickbooks program because all of my employees can log into the program from different locations at the same time. it works great with my small business to easily access invoices as well as the payment logs.
. truly powerful software! takes a bit of getting used to, but once you grasp how it works, which is relatively simple, you're able to meaningfully track the financial health of your business.
. userfriendly, can create bills and estimation from mobile app too
"problematic app. upon originally downloading this app i was pleased. for the first 24hrs. i was impressed. then, i ""sent"" an invoice which the customer never received. next, it failed to update or sync with my account. when i attempted to update manually it chronically reported an error sighting that i should check my internet connection. frustrated, i uninstalled and reinstalled the app. now, it doesn't stay open for long before saying it stopped unexpectedly. i've reported every error without receiving any feedback."
very good and getting better!. qbo has been a great addition to our company and has many great features over qb desktop. there are some bugs to work out but i'm very happy so far with the online application.
not good for my use. i would like to have a setting to hide all account information so i can have employees out with ipads giving estimates or quotes. this is for personal business. good for that but forget trying to take pictures of receipts to write expenses.. takes longer than scanning them on my pc
slow books. can’t accept transactions in banking section. sluggish app, end up using the computer more often.
kewl app. thanks
. mediocre app.
excellent application. i like it, amazing app 👍🏼
great ap. great easy to use app really close to getting rid of my laptop entirely
really great :). really great software package. requires some dedicated learning for someone with no accounting  bookkeeping background  but functionality and power of the software are fantastic. very happy with quickbooks. thanks :)
great app when it works.... after update to ios 13 as well as the latest version of the qbo app, i cannot access supplier information. on top of that, i am unable to save expenses that i am trying to enter too. there goes the productivity. qbo team really need to be better at this!
thnx the app. i loved it
awesome app. love it
awesome app. i was hesitant going to the monthly subscription, but it has been awesome always having access to my business account. the app looks and works just like the desktop app on my mac.
good resource. i will update this as i see necessary, haven't made a customer service call yet. but overall the navigation is something to get used to because it's very in depth and many details that you would expect are included with the software.
. update has not fixed this issue! why can't i see bank account details in the app? you can on the ios app contacted help desk who couldn't help! without access to accounts the app is effectively useless. i have done everything you suggest. home screen is now blank! so even worse than when i started. i have also contacted support with no solution as yet.
no refund and help support was clueless.. called twice no one could help me and both phone numbers proved useless. billing support was not helpful. could not even locate my ipad online subscription thru itunes. waste of time and money in my experience.
. using a samsung note edge: cannot update estimates at all. been using this app for months and it constantly locks up and crashes. in response to the developer: it seems i have to reinstall it every day just to get it work. i have been doing this fix for a long time and it still does not resolve the locking up or crashing problem.
i can't look up pertinent information. i can't look up pertinent information on the go while i am meeting with clients, such as a yearly sales history. doesn't do much good for the small business owner. definitely not worth paying so much money for an app that has no functionality in the field.
. good apps.
. really easy and all self employed services (invoicing, expense recording etc) in one place
qbooks is a entrepreneur's dream. i've been doing bussines as general contractor the last 20 yrs, always i tried to find a software where i can handle all my administrative information at all (invoicing, payroll, expenses) with this apps you can get everything at your fingers reach, so you can control all money inout. it's a world marvel!
qb online and ios app. with the online and ios app this is exactly what i needed to be completely mobile. i can start on one and finish on the other.
. the app makes use in the field easy.
quick books app. this app is really good, can do nearly everything i need from the phone.
. you have to use the website to update banking transactions. the website sometimes takes days to update them also, sometimes it's virtually instant, but sometimes it takes days. it's annoying to have to use a website every time you use an app.
. i've used it for around 18 months so far and i love it. i hated accounting in university so it was my biggest fear when setting up a business. quickbooks has made it really easy.
alcatel one touch. great app for small business.
horrible. constant crashes at the worst of times!!! aarrrggghhhh!
quickbooks is genius. i don't normally write reviews for apps. but quickbooks online is simply amazing. i've been using it for over a year and i absolutely love it. i can download transactions from the bank so no boring data entry and can create invoices on the go on my phone. so good.
fantastic app for my ipad pro!. i recently acquired an ipad pro to use for my business and instantly downloaded quickbooks to use on the go. this app has been wonderful for sending invoices, logging my expenses, and managing the books in general. so far, i have yet to experience a crash and everything has been working well for my needs!
creating an account is a joke and does not work.. creating an account is a joke and does not work despite entering all information correctly. uninstalled!
. so glad we didn't pay for xero. qb does everything we need and is user friendly for techderps like myself.
makes my life 10xs easier. having quickbooks online is the best thing to happen for my business. i have more time to spend with my family and i’m also able to keep up with my business better. all of my information is right at my fingertips! love it!
. can't log in, useless!
. useless app. can't integrate one of the biggest bank of australia (cba) with this app. support is just forwarding issue from one team to other. wated almost one hour on the phone. solution is to forward the issue to next level. there are three companies under my account with same name. cannot delete company. how app allow to create three identical names?? wast of time and money.
great app!. only complaint is i wish i could create a invoice and with the total job and then invoice for a smaller amount keeping the job total on the same invoice if that makes sense. no other complaints. overall i would recommend to anyone!
nice but crashes. i like the app other than the fact that after a few minutes of work it crashes. it reliably crashes. helpfully they fix it soon, it's frustrating to have to log back in every time.
simple but professional. i could just learn most of it by myself, at least for my small nonprofit organizational needs. but would like to see more nonprofit features in the mobile version as well!
not complete functionality.. this app doesn't have the full functionality of the website, so when i'm on my tablet, i just use the website instead of the app.
. awesome app, extremely useful to track finances.
love it. i love the quickbooks program because all of my employees can log into the program from different locations at the same time. it works great with my small business to easily access invoices as well as the payment logs.
great flexibility. love being able to do estimates and invoices on the go.
. this app requires a password even though i chose google login. if i need a password anyway, what's the point of a google login?! quickbooks online doesn't require it. disappointed and uninstalling. i have enough accounts as it is.
comprehensive. your accountant in your hand. seriously.
makes business happen!. this powerful app makes my business happen! very easy to make sales on the go and keep track of all my ins and outs. thank you!
good but............... this app needs to have a debit option when adding expenses. also i am really frustrated at this moment, because your app keeps crashing on my ipad. if theses 2 issues are fixed i would give it 10 stars
highly recommend. as an accountant, i use quickbooks everyday on a variety of clients. i wouldn’t recommend any other software. the cloud based platform is ideal for ease of access and management.
worst thing i’ve ever used.. can i give this no stars, it is awful, as others have said awful support, i’m not vat registered but after an update my account changed so it started calculating vat now left with a massive bill for the accountant to fix all the entries. my advise avoid like the plague, wouldn’t touch this app with a 20m barge pole, it’s the worst app and worst support i’ve ever seen.
can’t log in. says my email and password can’t be found (app only).
"missing some elements, overall good. i like this app. great to be able to give client receipt right away. wish we could do deposits and reconciliations and change default ""payment due"" area."
life saver!. i absolutely love this app. when i first started out and i didn't have that many funds in the bank, this was one expense i didn't even have to overthink. after using quickbooks online app for only a week i knew i could never go back to organizing my finances on my own. i use it every single day!
must have!. absolutely vital to my daily business. clients are impressed when i produce an invoice on the spot and process their credit cards before i leave the job site.
fix this!. when using my new iphone x the app crashes every time i try selecting the “invoices” button?! also... constantly have to log in and log out to update my information?! why?! please fix these major issues!
great app. what a great app and ease of access across all platforms.
overly complicated for sole prop. this app is useless for simple small business money in money out, it shouldn’t be this hard and definitely not worth the fight
. great app, easy to use !
. app worked good for the first couple of months but now hasn't work for a few days straight on my samsung phone. emailed the report to them but have received no reply.
great. i wish i would have used qb a lot sooner. life would have been much easier.
great app. qb online app is a great app and it's only getting better. it frees up alot of time to be able to run a business on the go.
. lot of functionality easier than web or desktop app.
convenience. i really love the convenience and accessibility of this app and quickbooks online. since switching from desktop pro to this i've been able to keep up with paperwork in the field. i think it's great. i just wish they made an upgrade so i could automatically subtract expenses from specific jobs. having everything separate is a real hassle.
good app. very useful app when on the go.
. excellent app. crazy versatile. love that they supply a basic reader free of charge. lots of ways to accept payment. input expenses so you can write them off for taxes. nice. stoked to use it.
pretty good. i'm a musician. very convenient for tracking my business. would be even better if it tracked mileage to and from my gigs. then perhaps a report on that too. otherwise, great!
. really helpful app for managing our church finances int the go! very easy to use and gives me most tools i need to get the job done when i'm not at my computer. highly recommended.
bookkeepers or better only! too much info available to users.. this app would allow a salesman taking orders to view way too much information. it's nice that it integrates with the qbo program, but what am i supposed to do about salesmen that only need to check inventory and write orders? surely they should be excluded from the company books! very disappointed in the time i wasted talking to intuit salespeople who materially misrepresent the functionality of the program
. easy and quick to use for estimates, invoices , receipts and keep track of expenses and income
ios 13 and later app crashes. the app works well prior to ios 13.0 when opened in an iphone running ios 13 later, the app crashes after faceid login.
. i can't even login, there is some kind of bug.
. horribly unresponsive and buggy. lacks feature parity with ios.
love the videos  love the whole system. easy, intuitive, and so rich with features.
ipad perfect until ios 8.5. app hasn't worked since 8.5 update. have sent several request about the app crashing and no one has gotten back to me. i've deleted and redone loaded, rebooted ipad, etc. when not crashing it's a 5 star app. please fix asap!
have to improve in customer support. an ok app for small business.. but horrible customer service.. first starters, you have to call them only during pacific time hours..? so i’m in delaware, which means, if i want to reach them i have to wait to get a live rep. then, their wait time is terrible.. 30+ minutes. ??? so one star for now.. once you guys improve in this area, i’ll be glad to recommend and change rating...
. great app and very user friendly! love that i can create documents right from my phone!
horrible. had to get because of credit card swiper. ever since installed takes dozen times to save anything and same with login. anything to do with saving glitches constantly.
love the qbo. mobile expense posting is cool
. this app doesn't work! such a disappointment to say the least! i'll edit my review once the app is available for use!
problem with update please fix. iphone x, after updating the app, it doesn’t let me edit any transactions at all, i can only approve what is recognized transaction, an unrecognized transaction is not responsive to touchscreen commands so i have to cancel edit. please fix
bad update. used to work good until last update now when i open the app is says downloading company data, gets stuck there for ages. if it finally loads, there are no customer invoices, just payments. tried deleting the app and reinstalling but does the same thing. the pc app works fine and my employees have samsung phones and they haven't complained of any issues may just be an iphone app problem.
invoicing on the go!. the app is a great companion to the online version. allows me to invoice and keep track of billable items on the go. there is so much more it does but for me invoicing right after the job is done gives me freedom to do my office work while having a coffee.
great app.. i am new to quickbook, but found this app as very helpful tool to run a small business, no matter where i am, at home, in the office or on the road. thanks +++++
no recurring transactions. why the hell would you make an app if it can't do any thing but read. i want to edit recurring transactions; edit and send invoices; and see every report. this is absolutely stupid, just sign in from a browser.
a pretty good app. update: they added deposits! it does everything i need now, upgrading to 5 star! all in all, this is a pretty great app. it does just about everything i need it to while on the go, but it is missing one key piece of functionality. it does not allow the recording of deposits and that is really important for me. other than that it functions flawlessly and has never given me any trouble. overall, i love it!
its ok. the app is ok my only issue is the invoicing it doesnt let you customize your invoice layout
incredibly glitchy. the app is glitchy despite updates. i’m not super impressed by intuit in general. i use their payroll for my business, a lot of glitches there too. app crashes or spontaneously exits my selections to “accept” for no reason and i have to start over. does not learn well, i have to reteach things over and over.
. great app
thanks intuit. i can create invoices at the job and get paid on the spot. ..no problems so far.
crashing. app keeps crashing every time i click on it!
. the app sucks really bad, it's full of continuous bugs and it is unstable, every time you try to add attachments to expenses the app freezes does not save and shut down, find another solution because it's sad.
great app. first time business owner and have to say it's a great way to stay organized
powerful. very good, gives almost all of the functionality as the browser version except for splitting and journal entries. but for daily review and acceptance of linked electronic transactions, this is great! also has a good p&l and balance sheet report.
best ap and program for home business. i trailed several other programs before quickbooks. it allows me to split an expense between personal and business which others wouldn't. the ap is easy to use and love that i can take a photo of the receipt. no more loosing receiptshaving them fade etc.
five star, defenitly!! :d. quickbook app is a great add to the software program. easy to use, fast and well organize!
business handled from my phone. works well, update is even better. can create invoices, print, email, track and reconcile business spending. shows if invoices have been sent ( when emailing) as well as read. would give 5 stars if i were able to record bank deposits with this app. currently customer payments remain in undeposited funds until i log in to the desktop site. also wish i could save time by printing batch invoices. overall very useful, easy way to handle business on the go.
. running my online business at ease. quickbooks makes it easy to invoice and they take care of calculating your sales tax to pay your state.
quickbooks app. as a finally self employed electrician after many many years in the trade i decided to try qb online & it is quite simply amazing, easy, intuitive, versatile & very good value, looks professional and cannot recommend higher. thank you, matt m.b.s. electrical, jersey
does not do simple qb tasks. this app does not have all the functions as the computer online version. i can't run simple reports and the payroll app which is separate does not allow me to make changes to the employee information. doesn't function like you need it to and it put me in a bind when i went out of town with just my ipad. i would not even give it one star. worthless.
. i've tyred everything!! deleted re download log in log out tryed it on anthoer phone i've rung your company up i've taken out a case and nothing has been done it's under investigation been like 4 days now!!
does not work with ios 13. beware!. crash on launch when using it on ios 13.
. so far i am verry happy with qb online. will update if this changes.
it works ok...but, be warned!!. they state 25 business days for payments to clear to your bank account, truth is it typically takes 510 days and way longer if payments are more than a few thousand dollars. they make you wait on your $ while they snag a chunk of interest on your funds. it’s been almost 12 months and we’ve decided to go back to square for their faster processing.
qb makes me look good. qb app is fantastic. i can write and present an estimate right at the job site or give my customer an invoice, or accept payment. in brief....it makes me look good!
. better program than the internet site on my mac book pro! very easy to use and very seem less operation.
. great app!
quick and easy. cool app if you have quickbooks already.
. really easy and great to keep on track of things
works for me. no problems, been using it every day for almost 2 months
. app never up to date with website or it does not show you everything you can see online. sometimes you can't even see anyone's invoices or estimates. always an issue.
. good app for managing business.
. makes my small business accounting much easier for me. i can send invoices, quotes and pay bills all from the comfort of my cell when i am on the road between jobs.
cody. no reports. no p&l. can not work with downloaded transactions, which for me is critical. looks good, but is not really useful if your trying to get work done. maybe it will get better!
. easy to use. make business life easier
getting better. you can keep doing more and more on phone. great for us small business owners. it would be 5 but when i first downloaded there was not a lot to transactions you could complete on app.
address. please allow me to copy and paste full address inside customer section. currently i can only copy street, city, postal code separately. customer wants me to add address of site worked.
awesome!. fantastic app. as a freelancer i am often away from my office. being able to create estimates and have my clients sign them on the spot has been great. and being able to send invoices from anywhere has absolutely changed my life! love it.
qb ol user. i almost can't believe they actually released this to the public. it is only half an accounting system. all you can do is see outstanding invoices. it is at best a limited reporting system. it is not a way to control a business.. a long way to go before even thinking about paying $0.99 for it ..
amazing app when it works. haven’t been able to use this app as of late because i use a password manager and the quickbooks app stopped allowing me to paste my password into the password field at login. tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, still didn’t work. this issue has to be fixed.
functional with problems. the latest update took away the ability to choose territory in the app even though using a web browser does. i contacted intuit to report the problem. very nice but nothing has been done to fix it. also, common reports aren't available in the app.
quickbooks. really hard to get online started i'll write another review when i get it started
. awful. go through the web browser instead. the app doesn't connect frequently, saying the program is offline, but i can connect through the browser with no problems.
expenses tab stopped working. please fix the expenses tab. it's greyed out on this version and i can't use it.
. good apps
. switch to xero even though its more expensive. better off wasting money on a useless app. cant even save a transaction. lousy support and engineering team to not resolve such a essential feauture after 1 month. subscribe at your own risk.
what a joke. i am not a software developer and who ever designed this joke is not one either
qb online. tout ce qu'il faut pour la pme. facilité, mobilité, flexibilité! un support technique accessible, compétent et rapide.
limited functionality. app doesn’t permit printing or downloading to a spreadsheet format. makes it impossible to reconcile accounts or print statements for records retention. very expensive with limited functionality.
. sales receipt and invoice not round off available in mobile apps create invoice not show retail invoice and tax invoice in mobile i am a paid version user and i am pc login all options are work properly but mobile apps issue i have made complete 4 tims in call center but agent ask me team work this issue
accounting made simple!. love it,love it.love it!!!!!
awesome. it saves me so much time. great to keep up with my business accounting. mostly simple to use. some features require a bit of basic accounting knowledge.
. love the app! it makes my job so much easier!
. 1720 update  i had used the mobile app for android for quite a long time with no issue and then approximately one month ago after an update the dashboard no longer has any information and is blank. i can still see activity but there's no way to get to customers or any of the other functions. i've emailed previously with no response. previous review: works well for viewing quickbooks info and taking payments
online. online is really user friendly and the app is a bonus
. how does this app can help the people in the mlm business ? ( ex: amway , avon and tuperware )
. you are loosing users. i also cann't login. please give me possible way to sign up.
app freezes. since updating my iphone to 13.0 the quickbooks app freezes once it opens. at this point it is completely useless.
i love quick books!!!. this app has made doing business easy for our company. it had allowed me to make my car a mobile office. i can do everything i need on the go. i wish the app allowed you to filter accounts by city, state but i am still very happy with it. sky sunner ceo thebloodycure
need help. i have problem with the data sync status. it written unable to get data. i can't even sent this message to your contact.
. app does not sync automatically.
. after installing and recovering my account details this app offers me some trial? should be stated somewhere beforehand.
this has helped me have a life. without this software i would be buried in paperwork . it helps me stay organized. i have been using one version or another since 2003. thank you
"complete shit. developers can't seem to get it right.. going from version to version will cause problems logging in. might as well not offer as a mobile app, ""on the go"" my ass. i was told ""we're working on"" (for the past 6 times i inquired) then the last time ""too bad, use the web site for now""."
high hopes cause big fails. the app crashes all of the time. no integration with desktop versions but ok. i though i would have something on the go for small invoices. i can't get through the first invoice. all progress gets lost with the crashes. i love how much time i save with the desktop version. there customer service has always been terrible. they can't even have a fully working version for the trial period. fail!
for last month since major online update its is useless. when i login it tells me i don’t have a subscription. i call support they tell me to uninstall the app and reinstall. after reinstall the login works but you cannot switch between your companies. i called them back. they said no one else is reporting this. three users in my offivr are having the same problem. i love the iphone app for entering receipts on the go but i can’t even do that now.
on way my home. thanks
horrible. constant crashes at the worst of times!!! aarrrggghhhh!
chris. love it!! great setup! easy. just love it!!
. pathetic app works too slow with a fast internet connection.. takes hours to get refreshed highly disappointed
. if i could give it a half star i would. i have a customer who paid me a week ago through my invoice and it still hasn't reached my account how can i run my business if my money wont be put into my account?
new update. i love the app and it has been great for us for years. however, the new update does not allow a custom date range for reports and when you edit an invoice it gives you a small screen that not everything fits on. please bring back the custom date range and make is so we can see everything on edits.
bad customer service. they are not helpful. they made a mistake to deactivated my account, after my complaint, they asked me to key in every single invoice again. this is unacceptable.
multiple currencies. it should support multiple currencies. can't key in expenses that are not in my home currency
awesome!. i have always enjoyed using quickbooks. over the years i have moved from quickbooks to quickbookspro to quickbooks enterprise and now quickbooks online. this online system is awesome. if integrates well with other systems i use, it’s easy to navigate (once you take the free courses), customer service is excellent when i have issues  and it will move straight into my turbotax corporate filings. love, love, love it!
helpful, but limited.. it is good for a pinch, but it very limited in the interface.
great app!!. i love it! this program has totally transformed our family business!!
useless. my boss uses qb to track my hours. as far as i can tell, i can't make those changes on this app. that makes this app totally useless to me.
broken app. unusable. app fails to load company data. waited an hour on the phone and never got help. killing my ability to invoice customers while mobile, which is the only reason i chose the online version that i pay for every month! intuit is not intuitive, they're only into your money. zero support. zero answers. zero. the worst.
great but needs to add acct payable. love the app but can't look up status of payments to vendors and outstanding bills to be paid.
. very good app for small business owners
difficulty. bad program because of the difficulty in the secret code i offer to delete the program and i do not want to waste my time in it if the secret code is difficult
great app for the ipad. great app for the ipad and small buisness
great software. this does everything i absolutely need it to do. i wouldn't use anything else it's easy to manage they have great customer service and i don't have any complaints about it keep up the great work thanks for making my job a lot easier.
. a few improvements could be made but overall, excellent app!
"great app for distributors. we can invoice and deliver on the fly without having to go back to the office to capture the ""in the moment sales"". our accountant has access and was able to set our account up to match his categories for a fast and no worry tax prep."
saves so much time. i got this app to help save time and it does. it took awhile to set up and i have had to phone for help a few times and they have been fab. i can send invoices and receipts form my phone. i am able to keep up to date on my accounts without the effort.
rubbish. app crash every second
won't print invoice with signature from my device. if i could i would give it five stars.. great app
