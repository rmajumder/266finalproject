. why can't i see bank account details in the app? you can on the ios app contacted help desk who couldn't help! without access to accounts the app is effectively useless.
. full featured app! quickbooks makes it easy to stay organized. this full featured app brings the desktop to you. easy to make invoices on the go.
great app. no longer have to worry about computer crashes and lost data
great app. very easy to use. reliable. every once in a while it has loading issues but it's rare.
pretty convenient!. i quite like being able to enter transactions on the fly. this app keeps me from procrastinating!
. great app for small bussinesses on the go
. works great and keeps me in the loop if my customers even open there invoice
insufficient information. the app doesn't have the features i need while away from my computer.
good app. it does ok in a pinch. certainly easier to search transactions on a computer.
"about 710. not bad but not good. the app keeps requiring updates if used on apple products. not an issue but the updates never appear. quickbooks blames apple and apple blame quickbooks. we ""updated to the cloud version"" from a pcm based quickbooks. so far we are very very disappointed."
. horrendous support from the philippines. works well when all the feeds are set up. just horrendous getting to that point
loving it. been hunting for a simple app for managing the finances of my farm business. this helps me with capturing and analysis of all my expenses and income. the reporting is also amazing. i also love the fact that i can even get more stats and reports via the web. amazing stuff. already introduced it to quite a number of industry colleagues. truly an amazing app
great app. i haven't learnt all the features yet. but, it's worth every penny.
great program. great program and its user friendly too.
works for me. no problems, been using it every day for almost 2 months
cumbersome. qb stinks on ice! i so miss the older versions! oh, qb online will not integrate into turbo tax! i would never use it again if i had a choice. i'm looking into sage. the menus are horrible it's so cumbersome to move from one screen to another. constantly hangs up and freezes!!!
qbo app. great to know i can do invoices etc on the go.
not reliable on weekends or holidays. times when i have to work on weekends or holidays i have the most issues logging in and being able to invoice customers. there is also times when i can’t login during the week, i’m guessing due to quickbooks working on servers! wish i could install as a program on my tablet instead of a app or still be able to use offline to print an invoice and receipt
. poor. this app worked fine for 2 years and now they have recently removed the feature where it automatically adds receipts to transactions. the support morons keep telling me it never existed in the first place but i used it for 2 years! i'm now looking for another app to use in it's stead. avoid it at all costs.
great stable app that keeps getting better and better!. gives me access to everything i want but i'm on the go or just don't want to pick up the computer or tablet.
. great app for small businesses
harry. after upgrading to this version i’m not able to sign on using the mobile app!! major set back when on the road and need to write an invoice!!
ouickbooks. setting up this quickbooks app is a joke , the system does not work and customer support has an attitude that is not willing to help!
. great app on my android. can it be used in my fire tablets?
phoned in. this could be such a cool extension, but like a lot of qb online, it feels a bit phoned in.  expenses show without account coding  what's the point?  report viewing is limited  dashboard is not customizable
love it!. qb is stunningly simple yet superbly sufficient to handle our business needs for invoicing clients, reporting ar and preparing us for yearend taxes. the mobil app is equally impressive!
great idea, poor execution.. intuit needs to hire better programmers. if they could just make it possible to see transactions within a report it would be so much better
great for both business and personal use. i have both complex personal and business financials and quickbooks is the best product i have used to date to track both. there is a bit of a steep learning curve to use it, but once you learn the software it is very powerful.
. amazing app. handles all my needs as a small contractor business.
nearly there. having finally had enough of struggling with sage i started with qb. loving the online program which is so much easier and more intuitive than sage. the ipad app is a nice touch to quickly check things but if you need to do more than 1 or 2 simple things then better off going online instead.
crashing at start up with ios 13. love this app but it crashes with ios 13 :( please fix
. i am still fresh with this app but sounds good to me
. great app use it all the time. east to use
. no problems for me. works great
sign in error. can't even sign in anymore. tried on multiple devices so i know it's not my phone. please fix
great software. great affordable option for small businesses. this software is incredibly helpful to ease the stress of being an entrepreneur.
. great app
. workz great....but shud have more options in the android app, wud be really nice to see inventory levels right on a phone app. 5 stars when it does.
love it. it is nice to be able to enter expenses and check invoices on the run.
. how about an update to the other app? suggestions that have been requested: 1) access to notes! 2) insert item above or below another on invoice. 3) merchant services integration. 4) take photos and attach to customerjob. 5) time tracking, the ability to punch inout for appts. 6) signature capture...things to be fixed: 1) map link still populates the customers name in the search (this was supposedly fixed, but it isn't). 2) support for custom fields on templates 3) editing of invoices and
doesn't work. app doesn't sync all data with quickbooks online. i see only my company name and customer list. no invoices, expenses etc. intuit support we're not able to help.
helps me so much. new business owner, this app has been so helpful. can do estimates send invoices and input expenses from any where, weather im at the store or on the go i can work
keeps crashing. every time i try to upload a receipt from my phone, it crashes when i press save & doesn’t save at all. i’ve tried closing the app & trying again, but it does it every time, so basically i can’t take a picture of any receipt & upload it. please fix! update: i still can’t upload a receipt unless i take a picture of it elsewhere & upload vs taking a picture of it on the app.
"is anyone home?. i give this app one star because it doesn't let you select zero stars! all i've gotten for three days is an endless loop telling me that""to use this app you need quickbooks online"". no kidding? i'd love to find some of the application problems some of you are complaining about. at least you can turn yours on!"
more of a headache than a help. registered online, used same login info for the app, and the app says it's a free trial. online service not communicating well with app and i was hoping to use the app most of the time. sigh.
. would give it 5* if i could see the summary view on the app (similar to the web version). i wish it could do everything that the desktop version could do, but i know that isn't always possible. *edit jan 2019* love the summary view, the app rocks
great software. this does everything i absolutely need it to do. i wouldn't use anything else it's easy to manage they have great customer service and i don't have any complaints about it keep up the great work thanks for making my job a lot easier.
great!!. works so well. love how easy it is to use, love how seamless the app works as well as the computer version. so easy to send invoices via email. was so happy when i found out easy it is to use!
so helpful. my business is basically my husband and me. when we are both out of the office, it's been difficult to have to wait to help customers. this app has allowed me to to create an invoice from an estimate, accept payment and send a receipt all from the truck!
. currently a subscriber to many quickbooks services. unfortunately, i am no longer able to access my account via the app on my mobile device after the latest update. will update my rating if the issue can be remedied
lacking features and a lot more development to go.. i particularly want to be able to do expenses while i'm out and attach receipts from my phone. i don't seen to be able to attach documents to expense records. document attachment is the single feature i moved to quickbooks online for. also can't access general ledger or bank accounts to process deposits, cash withdrawals, account transfers and journal entries etc. need to run a balance sheet report to view bank balances.
. great app, simple to use, alot of resources.
. great accounts software, easy to use and pricing is best in the market. previously used myob and will never go back.
very handy tool. in small business? you're going to use this app... a lot!
quickbooks = easy bookkeepping. love the mobile app, very easy to use. access accounts from anywhere, raise invoices, pay invoices. simplified bookkeeping!!
. need to change the phone number in the invoice... how?
. fantastic and very simple to use
i would not recommend. 1. very very very expensive 2. not intuitive and not user friendly 3. no local support or live support from malaysia
. nice app very usful and conviniant
. one of my favorite apps this app is so convenient. i have the ability to check my book anywhere at anytime.
horrible since last update. constantly crashes and slow to load. not to mention we are paying almost $800 a year to use this crappy program. lacks many features the desktop version has.
great app. for my business is been really helpful app. i'm a painter contractor, check job all day, if i need to send estimates and invoices now i can do it on the road.
zero stars. another worthless update. now you have to login every freakin time i set my phone down and of course invoicing a customer with a credit still doesn't synchronize correctly and has never. if you're looking for an accounting system please shop around before getting tangled up in this company. i've been waiting for that call from tech support for 5 years lololol.
office manager. makes my job so much easier to do, invoicing on the go!!
. not the smoothest running game app
loads of bugs since updating to ios 13. broken links. can’t call up customer information. dashboard only shows banking information. invoices and estimates haven’t saved when generated on mobile device.
the option yo use qbo doea not work for ages. the option to use google maps for location misdirects you to install google maps even if it is already installed. this issue had been there since ages and they don't fix it. that's why rated bad. google maps is a must for me. apple maps suck but the app leaves you helpless with apple maps.
great app. i have been using it and it is good. though i wish more features were added for suppliers.
. it won't sync with my account and often won't open. update: after emailing my info to the email they responded with, i never heard back. i also called and was told that they'll work on it and email me. haven't heard yet, maybe next week.
its ok. the app is ok my only issue is the invoicing it doesnt let you customize your invoice layout
garbage. this app is junk!! support for this app is useless looks like i will be going back to freshbooks, it may not be a accounting solution but at least it works and i can import my info without manually entering. my business doesn't have time for me to spend hours with support when i need to be taking care of my customers ms support
. easy to use and one of the best support system.
. great program
crabbywyatts llc. great tool has made my life easier.
. downloaded because i was told its a app that would help me. i wasn't ready to learn. today i 😍 this app!
". 6.10.19  i hate it. you can't do ""billable"" expenses from the app. you cant edit invoices that have been sent. terrible. i hate it. 8.12.19  still hate it. noone has ""investigated""my situation. 👎👎 12.5.19. yup.. still hate it. i use it but cringe every single time i open it. pos app. zero stars"
awful, just awful. doesn't even show taxes or vat, you have to log on with a desktop browser for that. wish i’d signed up for another accounting app.
horrible since last update. constantly crashes and slow to load. not to mention we are paying almost $800 a year to use this crappy program. lacks many features the desktop version has.
satisfied customer. i'm a new user of qb app, and like what i see so far. it's easy to use and is a great asset to help keep my finances straight. it's worth the $10 per month.
not pleased. for one i still can't redownload the app after i accidentally deleted it. it's been months. i hit the cloud button and it does nothing. i also put an estimate in and the phone didn't save it. when i checked desktop it was saved 6x because i kept trying to do it on the phone. the app has many glitches but it is helpful when i'm not by a computer but u cannot rely solely on the app.
needs work. i love the functionality of it but i wish it would integrate paypal for the option on invoicing. my customers all use paypal & im double sending because there is not a paypal button on this invoice program!
. love this app.... only two things that i can't figure out. first, will not let me have a service date when making an invoice. most important, cannot figure out how to get it to accept the online payments thru ipn. on the desktop version it is highlighted on the invoice and in the email when its sent. other than those two issues, this app is great. would love to use this daily!
good app. helps me run my business in paperless mode. crashes when i push terms while creating invoice or estimate. please fix this.
love quickbooks. this is the best accounting software there is. quickbooks makes my life so much easier and running my business is so much smoother with the available accounting options!
great value. does all the basic accounting functions you would expect. nice to be able to operate away from desktop situation.
stopped working after the update. this was working great until the software update last week. now i end up creating multiple copies of invoices and estimates and the app just freezes on the saving screen. i can only finish off by logging in through a web browser and completing the task. please fix this fast intuit!
fantastic software. a superb help to my business invoicing and payments are so easy to sendview and accept. easy to use and never had a problem.
ran into unsupported transactions within 1 minute. very disappointing. it seems like the app isn't complete.
. very user friendly, works great on my samsung neo and desktop. highly recommended
qb online app. i love it! the app makes it easy for me to check on my business, record transactions, and review reports.
fix the bugs. this program has many bugs and has connectivity issues. the level of problems with the software is extensive. when the program works correctly it works nicely, but the downtime and glitches greatly degrade the value of this software. i would look for an alternative accounting software package. i do not know anyone who has used this software that would give it a five star rating. in other words, i am very skeptical of the rating shown.
now i don't need to use my desktop anymore. i use my phone for everything like checking emails and surfing the web etc. the only time i would use my desktop was to create invoices. well those days are over thanks to this app
very slow. this app is very very slow.. 10 minutes to load , another 10 minutes to load customer screen, and 15 minutes to apply 1 payment
. great app! very convenient. it's actually functional.
. works great!! great app and this helps you lesson the paper work when you get back to the office!
never has worked on my s7 edge. i loved this app when it worked with my htc. since i switched to this phone, it keeps giving me an error message and despite talking with support multiple times, nothing has been done to resolve this. i have uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times and it has not resolved the problem. i have seen similar issues reported with this phone.
great on the move!. really easy to use, keeps my accounts up to date all the time, so much easier than finding time when i'm back home! clients get invoices instantly and i keep on top of payments and expenses. first class
. very handy great app
not suitable. i was hoping to be able to manage qb from my ipad as if i had access to my qbo accountant tools. sadly not. back to the laptop to actually get my work done.
. great app for invoicing and tracking expenses
all my financials in my pocket.. i use it everyday to keep up with invoices and payments. and i plan to use it internationally when we move overseas to keep my finger on the pulse of our transactions.
best app ever!. as a business owner on the go, this app saved me lots of time and money. highly recommend it to small business owners like me who need to keep their books update while on the go. professional invoicing and end of the year reports for taxes are a life saver. everything on the cloud so no need to worry about loosing file. i love it!
. all i need to do is pay contractors via direct deposit. after signing up for your the most expensive subscription package. i then found out i also need a payroll package!!! this was a total waste of time and money. i would give zero stars if i could.
great app!. i love the mobility of the app. it helps me stay on top of my bookkeeping work while i'm on the go. makes managing multiple businesses that much easier!
not many useful features...yet(?). no access to trial balance or p&l reporting. no access to cash balances. no report writing or report generating capabilities. i guess it's free, but i hope there is a robust pipeline of upcoming features.
sales tax calculation is wrong. when creating an invoice, the app does not honor customer's sales tax setting. it applies tax even on customers with tax turned off. please fix asap!!!!
. i do invoices and print from my recliner. love this app. and sometimes generate estimates minutes after finishing my work before leaving the clients home. very convenient !!
worth it could be improved. works well, my only complaint is different functions are available or not available depending on how you access quickbooks. can be a little frustrating when i need to send an account statement and have to do it from a pc as that option seems to be absent on iphone and ipad access. better than my other invoice options by far worth using for sure.
. not sure if this was resolved but in reviewing past expenses and invoices, it looks like 85% have disappeared. if i entered more than 1 expense on a single day, it kept 1. some days i entered 56 receipts if not more and now i'm redoing them all. switched to a bookkeeper this year so haven't used the app in 6+ months.
awesome. such a great package. it made my life so easy with the phone app that i can raise invoices and quotes on the go. it also makes your business look heaps bigger and professional by having proper invoicing that allows taking signature on quotes too. loving it.
. garbage. been with qbo for 4 years. app is impossible to use now more than ever
poor.. really poor set of options compared to the desktop “app”.
. dashboard won't even populate. menu button doesn't work. i can only see recent activity. i can not use the app at all!!!!
best bookkeeping and accounting software. quickbooks is the best bookkeeping and accounting software that is to be found. i highly recommend it!
good but lacks key feature. i love everything about this app for running my business, but they have not added the ability for a customer to enter a tip at the signing screen when paying with a card. i've requested the feature multiple times over the past year with no response from quickbooks. this is a key feature that is present in every other card reader app.
. yay, i can do more than make notes on qb on my phone or tablet!...i love being able to have brunch and invoice on my tablet now
good for invoicing only. i was really looking for an app that i can put receipts for purchases in as i buy things and download later to qb. this is not it
. amazing app ever!!
. very poor app, theres no place that shows you income. its all outgoings etc. it shows profits but not individual sales, it allows you to create sales receipts but thats no good for past sales. app has let me down, nothing like what you see on tv, will be using a different app from now on, warning to all do the trail first, i didnt and it cost me.
mobile glitches... love using quickbooks but i run my business out of town where we are not able to have wifi other than mobile hotspot. using the quickbooks mobile has been convenient but also a p.i.t.a... glitches, closes on its own, logs me out, and sometimes doesn’t save invoicesestimates. has been like this for a while and haven’t had any changes..
. app doesnt start until i hit link 4 ot 5 times
good but............... this app needs to have a debit option when adding expenses. also i am really frustrated at this moment, because your app keeps crashing on my ipad. if theses 2 issues are fixed i would give it 10 stars
works well, missing hours and job cost report. pretty happy with qbo, wish it had a job cost report, wish the app would let me enter hours for employees.
love the app, but price is too high. i love the app, but when will the price increases stop. as soon as i have time to research other programs i will cancel my subscription. $40 per month is too much to just invoice customers and reconcile my bank statement.
excellent app.. simple to use and very affordable.
so much effort!!. downloaded this to try and make my life easier but setting it up is so much hassle!! can't add my bank account for some reason though i believe i'm typing the right details in  zero replies to my emails for help and whenever i've called for help i end up speaking to someone who obviously has no clue about the app for 30 mins  why is it so difficult?! don't bother.
freedom. great piece of software as i'm able to invoice customers right from a tablet and be on my way!! well done!
working great. app is easy to use on the go. some things are better done on desktop but for the most part can do a invoice from phone and accept payments.
. quickbooks is amazing! this program and app has made our small business easy, organized, and is the main hub of our online customer service and accounting!
request. how can i easily find the last price charged to the customer on a specific item?
keeps everything in one place. great app! i keep all my business and personal expenses logged and in place from my phone. i can also track multiple companies. gives me so much piece of mind and way easier for keeping track of taxes and book keeping.
. this couldn't be simpler! awesome app!
works great. good app. works great on the road for creating fast invoices on site. great companion app for quick books am dos fully functional.
this update is total trash!!!!. errors on just about everything i try to do and things save twice and web pages aren't ready for ipad pro! don't update!!!!!
. use this app in desperate situations. features are limited. i cannot record deposits via this app.
awful. doesn't work.. logs me out instantly every time i sign in... wish i could evaluate more. love the online version, but this app is struggling.
garbage. do not use this app will create an accounting nightmare can’t export back to desktop or keep your data with out staying up with their monthly payments just junk
nice, but naughty. i am writing this review at christmas, that explains the headline :) this app used to be awesome. now i get a lot of can not connect to data or can not refresh data even after multiple refreshes. hope they fix it
crash. your latest update is crashing. it doesn't let me open the app. please fix immediately
frustrated. very difficult to make adjustments and when receiving a payment i have not found a way to receive cash as will as a card on the same invoice. frustrated
. quickbooks please make it so there's the option of where payments are deposited on sale receipts for the android app as its available on ios. other than that is not a bad app.at all. 👍🏼. still waiting for the option on android of where funds are deposited.
. very easy step by step accounting software
. great app. makes quoting and billing a breeze.
. great little app. like that it syncs with online version. also like the big fonts and easy to read.
editing chart of accounts. i love everything except for when i'm editing my chart of accounts. when i go back to upload pics of receipts, fix categories and dates the phone app on iphone crashes. it's been doing it for several months. i have passed on the information, updated my phone, updated the app to no avail. very frustrating as it's an integral part of accounting for my small business.
easy to use!. this app gives me the leverage i need to stay organized.
qb app. this app worked fine but up until this recent update there are a few glitches and it shuts down in the middle of updating and invoice!
experience getting worse. entering transaction requires way too many taps. it isn’t location aware to suggest transactions you just always search. recent updates have some bug that makes the app download the data file with almost every login and login often you must. usually twice a week it loses my password. i have enjoyed quickbooks online but this app experience may have me evaluating competitors in december.
disappointed. downloaded this app so i could buy the payroll feature for my new company but it crashes immediately upon opening.
amazing!. this app undoubtedly helps running multiple businesses on the road possible! when i finally switched my businesses from desktop to online there were a few things missing. i wrote a few complaints and spoke with their development team...few short months later...boom! additions were made! one if which is being able to switch businesses within the app. definitely much easier than logging in and out all the time.
used for many years but. intuit is increasing the price of quickbooks by 25% the next billing period. the app doesn’t support key functions that you can access online, for example adding multiple email addresses to one invoice.
review. i am self employed, i find quickbooks is easy to use as my business is extremely simple. i do have an issue with the annual cost. i think that you should have different rates for individuals like myself who only use it a few times a week.
works great. does a great job
customer service & support sucks. go with freshbooks instead.
works well but can’t see inventory level in app. would be helpful if i could check inventory levels without going to web, other than that pretty handy app
slow. very slow
not reliable. is not reliable. not a replacement for desktop app or web based qb online. different icons, different navigation, missing tools reports and features. data does not reliably import into app from accounts.
. sorryest app i've had. cannot even log in.
thumbs up for the business help!!!. take the time to go through the tutorials and this is an amazing app to help with any small business!!!
difference maker. love the program, made it much easier to price jobs, track paidunpaid invoices and keeps track of all business info
. great app, doesn't crash and still much to learn from it bur its helping keep my business organized
. does what it says it does, i couldn't expect more!
best app to fallow my customers!. qb online + qb app is the best!
is an average app. is a good app but with all these update is confusing my customers and sometimes they can't pay online. i can't access it from my phone. it's in and off so be warned!!
. great app. as a small business im able to send my customers invoices and customize them to fit my company needs. i love this app and highly recommend to small business owners that needs to keep track of all of thier company finance. thank you quick book for making my life easy.
easy to learn and use. everywhere access, integrated bank and credit card transactions. easy to create transactions on the road.
. great app
. it's a great app. i use it all the time with my company. very efficient, and easy to navigate. automatically logs out so no one else can get access to it ( logs out after being in active for a certain amount of time). making banking, estimate invoice, and employees records very easy to keep track of. also love that i can store customers an accept payment online also. only downside sometimes it can be slow but other than that it's outstanding
crashes. it crashes upon opening on iphone 4s now
mobile invoice and so much more. great app!.
. it's very useful
subpressions. like the mobile app
. it sucks scam!!! so i tried quickbooks just for hel,p i got logged out of the app and now i have to pay $400 just to restart my password other companies are free.
very limited... quickbooks is one of the best accounting tools out there... however this app is very limited. ipad is a very powerful device. but this app doesn't take advantage of that. things like: * auto save invoices to the files app * option to choose payment type * when you paste an email from the email apps, it doesn't recognize those emails.. * option to add company stamp and seal to the invoices
. can't access my quick books account from my phone. worked fine for a month now when i need it it doesnt work.
. never received money from paid invoices. terrible customer service
invoicing. i use quickbooks as a means to invoice customers and collect deposit for jobs. for me it's worth it. it would be great if you could get a notification that the customer has decided to pay by credit card should you need to adjust your estimate.
. sucks. can't create invoices easily. much like quick books online it has become to complicated....after years of both i'mm switching
useless!. who is writing these positive reviews? this app is completely useless. it has none of the functionality of qb online, and neither does the mobile version accessible from a browser. with all of the money we spend monthly on qb products, the lack of useable features on mobile devices is extremely disappointing. can't even get a register balance? ridiculous!
new to app. am enjoying being able to automatically list expenses & add receipts as i go. other apps promised this but kept crashing. i feel that i can now better control my finances.
. app works great for managing some aspects of your business online.
taking too long to integrate with desktop version. all the press releases state that quickbooks is usable across all platforms, it is only part usable on the ipad version and even less on the iphone. have been waiting weeks for it have full functionality on the ipad.
fix finally now i can get back to work.. this version fixed the errors from the last update. glad it working again. quickbooks has been good except the last update. this one fixed the issue. we us this app for our onsite business and it's great. several times i would send an invoice to the customer when i'm leaving their home and before i get to the next job it's already paid.
. newest update (android nougat, galaxy s7) when creating an invoice or estimate, upon saving it just hangs. because it hangs, you try to back out. when trying to back out it asks if you want to save changes, you can select no, only to discover that your ten attempts to save did in fact create ten invoices. specifically the component that should after a save, take you out of invoice editing to look at the invoice is not operating correctly.
useless. this app is useless because if you have an online account with mac or pc you cannot use this app on your ipad! save your time, don't download it.
great app. i am just learning how to use it better things i would like to see is how to create a priceless
sign in issue. great app, except the need to confirm with text or email every time upon sign in!! would have rated higher with out this issue. very frustrating
. awesome app, everything and more than expected
don’t you qa this stuff?. the expenses screen is still full of bugs. the whole thing goes wrong after adding a photo (which, incidentally, are now auto cropped even worse than before) and returning to the expenses screen. don’t you test this stuff before releasing it?? (i’m on iphone x).
". about the only thing this app does real well is it crashes all the time. some features of this app i can't even get to without it crashing. so all said i am able to look up customers but other then that it's useless. i try to use it on a samsung 10"" tablet"
"disappointing. if you also make ""mint"", why make your subscription service app so much worse? mint is great. this app is not."
deceiving. silly me. i thought quickbooks had somehow released a free service. i installed this app, and the first thing i am presented with is a screen asking me to sign up for a free trial. sorry, $12.99 per month is just not worth it for quickbooks until they finally build a decent rental business module. i hate being tricked into downloading apps that are actually not free.
. great way to write and send invoices in the field
awful. iphone app pretty much unusable in the real world. always wants to be signed in each time you open it, touch id feature doesn't work. today it's complaining the app needs to be updated before i use it, it then directs me to the app store where it shows i already have the latest version!
. not all of my customers show up and neither do all of my past invoices. this makes it impossible to send out invoices unless i want to create a new customer profile every time. so, for my use, this app is effectively useless most of the time.
. great app! i use this to manage my small business information.
cis unfriendly. useless if your a contractor or subcontractor. if your in the construction industry, this app is useless. you cannot create cis invoices which renders this app useless.
. i love qb it does everything but it takes to long to get your money so i've been processing with paypal then copying it over to this fix this issue and 10 stars
excellent tool. this is great as a mobile app.
junk  plagued with issues. this is is great when it works, but is plagued with bugs. as of recently it logs me out to “refresh,” then when i log back it it tells me the account doesn’t exist. i fix this i have to delete the app and reinstall it, every, single, time. and their customer service is terrible. they never have any solutions.
. you are loosing users. i also cann't login. please give me possible way to sign up.
so convenient!. i can access accounts and bill clients immediately after appointments. it is very easy to navigate and accomplish what i need done!
. really useful in daily tracking
. i like having access to the product on my phone but i wish the app did as much as the full website.
rubbish. the openoverdue invoice section won't show the invoice details. it keeps saying the filters are wrong. the suppliers invoices only show the payments made not the actual invoices. support make all the right noises but nothing happens. it has potential but it still needs more work.
. works amazing when having to do my invoices on the fly and can't get to the office. also to check my estimates
. would love to know how this app works but as soon as i open it... it crashes. if you guys fix it ill adjust my review. but until then. you suck. all fixed. awesome work!!!!!
. useless app. can't integrate one of the biggest bank of australia (cba) with this app. support is just forwarding issue from one team to other. wasted almost one hour on the phone. solution is to forward the issue to next level. there are three companies under my account with same name. cannot delete company. how app allow to create three identical names?? wast of time and money.
. very happy. i'm a sole trader but still enjoying the benefits of the full version. worth every cent
great app. yet again another update and even more glitches, you charge a fortune and cannot provide a decent service  i’m considering switching to a competitor as you have breached the contract that you have with me. this needs fixing urgently and you need to refund subscription fees! my advice to businesses and the selfemployed is do not use quickbooks!
will not let me access my info!!!. ever since i got new phones for my technicians ,samsung s5, i have not been able to access any of my customers, transactions, or invoices. i use qbo for my business, but have now lost all mobile capabilities. if not resolved, i will be forced to use a different accounting software. 5 stars if working properly.
". this app is trash, has me very upset won't let me add a bank account just keeps saying ""hmm connection error"". this is bs i just signed up for this service and won't let me connect your app sucks and most likely will seek a refund. have tried wifi, mobile, what the funk, not quick in my opinion..."
great app. coming from using xero for my accounting software, i can say this app and platform as a whole is far more superior. i would recommend to anyone to switch to quickbooks.
. i have down loaded the app but its not working properly its frustrating
. can't create journal entries. super slow app, super slow pace of mobile app feature rollout
not as intuitive as desktop version. not as intuitive as desktop version. since 1986 used before intuit bought out money counts. lots to learn yet nice to be able to move the line items around. been wishing for that for 30 years
. convenient. not all the features of desktop app but adequate for most needs.
. i like my experience so far!!
add more countries. i really love this app but my country, ghana is not part of the selected countries please kindly add it.
seems to work decently. it crashes occasionally but so far i like being able to addmatch transactions while laying on the couch
signature box not wroking. when client tries to sign in box on a credit card transaction with a apple pencil or with finger the box moves around. no signature is captured.
getting too flaky. i’ve been a subscriber for about 2 years now but am now randomly getting locked out of the app where it thinks i don’t have a subscription! i’ve reported the issue , it always gets resolved but then returns ! went to do my accounts and quotes this weekend and guess what .... i’m locked out ... again! is that acceptable for a business app ! definitely not.
owner. i actually have never written a review for an app, and i've had an every iphone since the 3gs, i read the first review for this app and was so disgusted at the panning i just had to write one in support. i have a small business and use this every day! it's great, well designed and very user friendly. i run a carpet cleaning company and run basically every part of my business with this app.
love this version of quickbooks!. we have multiple companies and run quickbooks in everyone of them. however, the last company we started i decided to use the online version to run this company mobile and absolutely love it! the app does need some accessibility features that are only available on the full version but it is still very user friendly.
useless for mobile access. doesn't have any of the features you would expect from a mobile app. if you want to do anything other than create a invoice or view transactions you put in from your desktop, its a waste of time. no balances, no accounts, nothing useful at all.
so far so good 👍🏻😃. software is straight forward and easy to use and if you are unsure, the support team explain everything.
love it and support intuit provides. very convenient app for expensing. had an issue crashing while logging in and customer support was very quick to respond.
great mobile app. this app is perfect for my business. i'm out of the office majority of the day so being able to send or create estimates and invoices is very nice. quick and easy
worse than useless. i downloaded this app as use quickbooks daily, the pc software is great! the apple app is such a waste of time, i can’t access any reports and the info it does show me is a waste of my time just a load of numbers that don’t mean anything. no thought has gone into this app i suspect it’s just a tick box exercise creating an app...
basic app. app functions are extremely limited, and i can't use qb web on any browser on ios devices (ipadipad pro 12.9iphone 7plus) as all browsers including safari, chrome and dolphin run in zoomed mode when want to enter invoice, payments, receipts and bills or even check reports and make unusable.
perfect. this app does just what i need to stay current with billings and payments.
update is amazing!. new update has corrected all issues, and the app works perfectly. love the design. perfect for small business.
great app. i personally find the app easier then the desktop version. everything is quick and easy to do. raise an invoice or estimate instantly and see your bank account balance. great.
ap crashes instantly on my iphone x. i have been a quickbooks user for about 3 years already. ever since i got my iphone x app doesn’t even open. i have tried hard restart, setting as a new iphone and still encounter the same problems. it’s incredible that i’m not able to use it now.
great app. simplifies my paperwork, haven't noticed any bugs yet.
. still in trial, but so far so good... very pleased with overall functionality! trial over, five years later... upgraded to 5 stars. perfect app for my small business. does what i need, always available, improves the client experience.
not for indian. please do remember this app is not useful for indian currency so don't waste your data.
expiring sessions suck. it's a great app and i'm using it all the time but the expiring sessions are infuriating. if you let us use touch id or a pin, don't make our session expire and force us to use our password! it completely defeats the purpose of pintouch id. it doesn't increase security, it's just super annoying. no other app that utilizes touch id does that  not even my banking apps.
great app. i am running a smal business llc for a tattoo parlor, great app for even simple tasks. definitely worth the money, and i wouldn't use anything else.
functional with problems. the latest update took away the ability to choose territory in the app even though using a web browser does. i contacted intuit to report the problem. very nice but nothing has been done to fix it. also, common reports aren't available in the app.
low rating until the app supports chart of accounts. the app continues to be under developed for functions that are developed in the web interface. the app is excellent for invoices and credit card transactions if you have a merchant account coupled to your qbo account. the camera can be used in app to document your receipts to the cloud and i use it extensively for hotelairfarerental car expenses and they can be attached to invoices when emailing your customers.
ilove. great job guys! love the look and layout. i will be reaching for my ipad instead of my phone from now on! 4 stars.... would have been a 5 but when i am working on an invoice i can't add service dates. this is important for me and i found myself going for my phone.
. this app runs silently in the background and tracks your vehicle movement. it used 47 gigs of data in two months.
crashes, not usable, nexus 5x. crashes and no longer usable on a stock nexus 5x on android 6.0.1. app is now useless to me on my phone which is a major problem.
. lets try its beat for small business highly appreciated this app every must have to use it .
. very good support in bookkeeping
what a joke. downloaded this app so i could pay employees and taxes on time without having to be at my computer and i can't do either, i have to be in front of my computer to do both. i don't understand why it's not allowed on mobile app.
. great accounting software
. does what it's supposed to and easy for non accountants
useless app. hard and bad wrote app. can't use many of the functions of regular online version.
brilliant!. easy to use, matches payments received and ties them off with your invoices, easy to see profit and expenses for each month. well worth the monthly payment, my books have never been so easy to keep!
very mobile. the app is excellent for anyone on the go. easy to upload info from the app. user friendly. tried a few other book keeping apps and found this to be the best by far
poor update. unfortunately this latest update has a bug which believes i am on a free trial which has expired. i can still log in to the system on the internet but the ios versions do not work on ipad or iphone for me now. in addition, an option to receive funds in to another account other than the main current account would be a great feature to implement on ios which is sadly lacking at the moment.
. it's a great app for any business. easy to use and your data could be accessed any where you are.
inventory tracking. terrific cloud software, main focus being inventory management from the web, except how do i track and edit inventory with the app version?
fast on the go. very useful once u get used to it!
works for me. just wish i could do deposits in app
app shows incorrect transactions. transactions do not match the selected vendor. works when you have few transactions. once you pass 20k it becomes slow and inaccurate.
better improvement. app running better
the best. buy an ipad. shred up your paper estimatesinvoicing. stop using pens. download this app. holy crap i've been in business 4 years and feel stupid after downloading this. plus u look awesome w an ipad. plus everything's stored forever.
. generally a good piece of software... but, if you happen to get an unusual glitch don't expect much help. two of our invoices have been resent to a client 3040 times per day for the last four months. my customer is upset and my bookkeeper has wasted days of time on hold or explaining the exact same situation to countless tech support. come on @intuitbrad is this the best your team can do?
terrible app. half the time i can not download my banking info, i can not do invoices. it’s junk for what you have to pay for it. i’m finding something new.
. good app
. makes life so much easier, i can input paymentsreceipts from the couch...ideal!
. still waiting on a transaction from last week. was told a lie. biggest mess i have ever seen. stay away from go payment . now it seems they kicked me off quickbooks from this bad review. way to go quickbooks
. the app always crashes on me, and now i can't even get it to open.
glad i got it. i got this app when my computer crashed and it was the best thing that happened to my small business
. the app worked great before, it had some minor issues here or there but now it is horrible. when i try to add an expense it only shows me 4 of my vendors and the only account i can assign is the cogs account. now i have to save all my receipts and remember to enter them when i get back to the office. what a pain. yes, my desktop app works just fine. please fix the issue, i loved the functionality before.
great. i’m loving this app
does not support multiple currencies. hope they can add multiple currencies soon. it's useless if you have a primary currency other than usd.
quickbooks. super easy to use! i was able to backlog and bring my business up to speed with quickbooks within a few hours after downloading quickbooks! operating the app is fun and accessible!
it's exactly the apps i need. simple to use. have all the features i need for my food truck business
wow. don’t know how i did my job without this program, i love it ! it helps so much!
. useful app. just love it
whyyy. why on earth would any app ask dor my banking information and password etc theres an api for those theres absolutely no way for me to share my password with anyone or anything... zero stars
take me back. new updates are awful. keeps crashing..unable to do simple functions on the go such as editing invoice, sending a statement, etc. old version was much better. change it back to how it was..not every update is a good update. especially not this one.
great but wip. better than the competition and best customer service in the space! well worth it.
major flaw. the app ui is pretty good and i really like the interface. the problem is that a lot of my invoices are not even viewable on the app. basically anything that has a delayed charge on it won't show up so there is a major glitch there or something.
streamlined. makes running my business so much easier
. great app. really helps invoicing and tracking payments.
easy. i'm still on the trial but it helps me move from paper to electronic pretty easily. feels even better that it is all in arms reach.
qb online. i switched to qb online because i needed the mobility so i can write invoices from my smartphone while on the go. my old desktop version was so much easier to use and navigate through than the online version. in my opinion the online version is far less professional and versatile. i guess i’m stuck here though as the desktop version doesn’t work while i’m traveling.
. app is crashing as soon as it starts... 🙄
don't believe the hype. this app is practically worthless. all important actions require you to be on the website. i need to be able to invoice, payroll, and do taxes from the app as i am hardly with my computer.
find & reports. would be faster to be able to find estimates and invoices by number. also be nice to look at reports.
. useless app. can't integrate one of the biggest bank of australia (cba) with this app. support is just forwarding issue from one team to other. wated almost one hour on the phone. solution is to forward the issue to next level. there are three companies under my account with same name. cannot delete company. how app allow to create three identical names?? wast of time and money.
. very easy and fun to use. i had to check it out before i buy it. well worth it
couldn't live without it. love this app. makes my life as an accountant easy! now that we have shifted our business to a more mobile one!
accounting made simple!. love it,love it.love it!!!!!
. i travel for work and this app is awesome. i can write and email estimates, invoices, and recieve payments on the fly. it makes my life way easier.
app crashes. this app crashes or cannot save my data on every entry i make. horrible app!!
only if it had bank register :(. that's my only complaint. other than that this app perfectly suits my needs
fantastic. great bit of kit can do everything i need on the go send invoices and put in my expenses
amazing!. this app undoubtedly helps running multiple businesses on the road possible! when i finally switched my businesses from desktop to online there were a few things missing. i wrote a few complaints and spoke with their development team...few short months later...boom! additions were made! one if which is being able to switch businesses within the app. definitely much easier than logging in and out all the time.
. great app...has issues every now and again but easily fixed with tech support!
. great app
great app. perfect to keep track of your business accounting.
keeps crashing. i absolutely love this app...but since ios 13 install every time i go to use it, it crashes. i sent an email to support but need this rectified. once that glitch is fixed it’s a 4.5 star app!
. recently broken. was using this daily on my samsung tablet but as of a couple days ago it stopped working on all my mobile devices. i've sent feedback within the app but still broken. it's frustrating as a paid subscriber to qb.
subscription does not work. after 1 month free trial (in which i never been interested as i was happy to pay from beginning) the app stoped working. payment is demanded, unfortunately on ipad or iphone version either it is not possible to make a paymentsubscription or the instructions are not clear enough or there is an error. to subscribe should be made as easy as possible.
. the app sucks really bad, it's full of continuous bugs and it is unstable, every time you try to add attachments to expenses the app freezes does not save and shut down, find another solution because it's sad.
ipad perfect until ios 8.5. app hasn't worked since 8.5 update. have sent several request about the app crashing and no one has gotten back to me. i've deleted and redone loaded, rebooted ipad, etc. when not crashing it's a 5 star app. please fix asap!
very handy app. so far like this app. i need not go to my computer for bookkeeping or to see what’s going on with accounting. only i am not happy about general entries. earlier, i was able to open and see general entries. now app doesn’t open general entry. when i tried to open, it took me back to homescreen.
. wow amazing app.this is very helpful app. thank you developers.likeit.
crash books pro. this terrific app asks you every few minutes to rate their program knowing that you want to tell the world how you can't send out an invoice without the app crashing. *update* i am having more issues with the app then ever. i can only assume quickbooks is either more useless then i thought. or they are retaliating for my review of their product. i have never had any program work this bad and i have worked it.
30 days trial. need to pay after 30 days
excellent. wonderful app to use. very handy when working out in the field. easy to get on the phone with a live person for any and all questions.
. beware anyone cis don't use this use xero being mainly a cis contractor it won't let me make invoices in app so have to use browser which doesn't work so have to wait till i get home to invoice from laptop. i'm stuck till end of tax year then i'm off
. useless if you can't filter invoices by #s. or actual date the job was done. all the invoices are jumbled and you can't find anything i have to know the exact invoice number which is not handy at all. the app is ok, but the invoice filters are a complete mess.
most impressive business app i've used in a long time. i use qb online everyday and usually there is some functionality degradation from desktop to mobile. i have yet to find any crippling loss of functionality with this app. if you love the new qb online this app goes hand in hand with your onthego accounting needs. highly recommended.
. with the new update my other user can't track miles when i rely on him to do it, completely useless update that changed the user settings.
easy to use. its very handy for me
when i am done, i am done!. as a contractor i love to do my estimates one time, hit convert to invoice one time, hit receive payment one time and i am done with my paperwork and money is heading my way before i leave the job site. when i get home i can just spend time with the family rather than swim through paperwork. great service!
awesome!!!. fantastic and love how much this program does for you. very simple to use.
horrible update!. wow this latest update has messed everything up quickbooks was finally working good please fix! some of the words don't even fit correctly on the screen its all mixed together! and worst of all like others have said it no longer knows my clients email address i have to manually input!
. so simple to use! i normally use qb from my computer but the app works just as well while onthego.
falta uma agenda. deveria ter um relatório, ou layout, que apresente as receitas e despesas de uma determinada data.
$12.95 a month = free ???. misleading. first month free, then 12.95 a month. my bank is free for these types of services. i'm not happy that i wasted my internet gigabytes on a download that i can't afford. unprofessional. if i could afford i wouldn't pay just because you don't explain that clearly before someone downloads. poor business
perfect for small businesses. all the tools needed plus user help forums, makes book keeping and accounting so simple.
. it's a good app. i recommend that if you're a small business or a freelancer, you may install quickbooks online...
crash. crashes each time i try to add a customer. i can't do anything with it now. iphone 6
after a year, still not comfortable. not sure if it's me or the program.
not suitable. not happy with this app and it won't let me cancel it! help!
crashes a ton. this is a great app for bookkeeping for my business, but it crashes almost daily on my iphone. please get better engineers for the functionality of this app!! so frustrating when i’m in the middle of printing invoices and the app crashes! how am i supposed to conduct business that way!?!
it's definitely gotten better. but the service address and being able to input seperate service and invoice dates are absolutely essential functions for me and their absence from the app makes the whole thing more or less unusable!
very convenient!. used for invoicing, watching accounts receivable. does well
just as simple as we could even think !!!!!. this app according to me is best as it's not that complicated and makes my business easy, i've not used any other accounting app so i consider this very easy for any layman who is not very good in accounting. it could have had few more options like individual job closing so to get more accurate and decrease the paper work.
crashes still to often. fairly good  duplicates imported credit credit transactions. freezescrashes too often. doesn't allow you to specify where payments go ...always undeposited funds ...
easy to use. great app to use
have been waiting to get this app. awesome!. great app! easy to use. wish i can take payments from this app.
. app won't upload my bank transactions. how do i add revenue?
love it!. great mobile online app tool that syncs with your online quickbooks on both mac and pcs.
. quickbooks is super useful for invoicing clients and sending receipts and estimates. there was a brief period of a few days when it wasn't working that was super annoying because it made me realize how useful it is.
so far so good. so far it does everything i want it to do. if you're looking for an easy to handle app that keeps u up to date look no further.
we love the qb app. one of the most useful things we have “out in the field” is our qb app that allows us to do bookkeeping by extension. probably the craziest place yet was checking qb from the pyramids of giza in egypt. it’s extremely convenient.
crashing. since updating to ios9, quickbooks keeps crashing after the login!!
super user friendly. this app is ridiculously user friendly a must have for any small business ownerentrepreneur!!
. limited functionality compared to the app that is made for the iphone
. naughty. doesn't tell you untill you've down loaded and set up it's only a free trial. now looking through it i can't find anywhere to delete to make sure i'm not charged.
superb app. works everytime for me, allows me to update invoices, expenses and record payments.
kinda cumbersome. this app isn't very intuitive and there are a lot of free apps that do the same thing.
. apps bad after last update... you can't easily see invoice and or estimate amount anymore, you have to click each invoice & estimate to see numbers... i will be changing program's soon if not fixed.... we need to be able to easily scroll up and down the hundreds of open invoices and see where things are, not open each invoice to get information... way to timeconsuming... can't screenshot what's going on because the update before prohibits this now.... please devs fix
. i love this app. it allows me to promptly create an invoice on the spot which allows me to close the deal quickly. every small business should use this app!!
unable to log in. i have used quickbooks at office and decided to get it for my self but after downloading app it keeps giving me an error when i try to log in to the app. very unfortunate...i really like quickbooks
its ok. the app is ok my only issue is the invoicing it doesnt let you customize your invoice layout
app doesn’t recognize credentials. this app worked well for me until the most recent update. now i cant login, says can’t find the account with this emailpassword. this is very annoying since i travel frequently without a laptop. now i’ve lost the ability to access my accounts via the app.
. it is easy to use the app and convenient to have on the go. however the app lacks the presentation of the computer online website which has better detail on each page. i would prefer to use the website page.
please fix this asap!!!!. this update is horrible and does not work properly at all! data doesn't refresh and i keep getting error messages. the only (very temporary) fix is to delete the app and redownload it  daily! lame! this must be addressed immediately.
. not sure if this was resolved but in reviewing past expenses and invoices, it looks like 85% have disappeared. if i entered more than 1 expense on a single day, it kept 1. some days i entered 56 receipts if not more and now i'm redoing them all. switched to a bookkeeper this year so haven't used the app in 6+ months.
highly recommend!. very useful when you're on the go and need to update and categorize for your accountant! better than their website.
. excellent app
. this app doesn't do payroll. apparently you can download quickbooks payroll but i couldn't find it. found it online and the google play website said the app is incompatible with all of my 7 different devices. sure this is available in the uk?
. great app!
. it takes a working knowledge of what this app is capable of doing to fully grasp how useful it is. i am learning more every time i use it.
. make sure you know what services they provide, as customer support likely knows less than you do.
. looks simple and imteresting
. not sure why i pay $16 a month for this app when it only works 60% of the time. please get the bugs worked out or i will have find another company to run my business with. cant access my account on tablet, cant save invoice or estimate on s8. please fix.
qbo app. very good indeed!
splendid. excellent to have such an app to complete all needs and it's on mobile too
quickbooks online not working. i paid my subscription thru itunes, got charged but haven’t been able to use it.... it keep giving me a message to subscribe which i already did. contacted apple, itunes, and intuit quickbooks and haven gotten anywhere... frustrating!!!
best business app. quickbooks has definitely made running my business much more efficient and has made it easier to close on deals. the estimate tool makes it easy to send professional looking estimates to clients, and with a click, those estimates turn into invoices. you can receive payments through quickbooks as well. add the payroll service and you can run the whole business yourself. i would definitely recommend this to any new business start up.
very poor support and feature. features are basic and they won’t let you unlock the others with poor support. don’t use
qb enterprise user. intuit forgot about medium sized companies with the need to use their program remotely. shame 😝
"disappointing. if you also make ""mint"", why make your subscription service app so much worse? mint is great. this app is not."
good but app missing functionality. the app does not compare to the desktop version. the app does not show menu item for employees. i am using android and have reinstalled as advised by qb support but it makes no difference.
good app. no complains
keeps locking up. the app keeps telling me i need to update to the latest version, but i already have it. it won't let me log on. frustrating. please fix or revert back to previous version until glitches are fixed.
crapapp. quickbooks program is nice though the company's blatant lack of interest in the osx platform baffles me... this app is basically worthless and does not update to changes made online four weeks ago... they have light years to go before this app is worthy of being used...
pretty good could be great. this ties in nicely with the desktop version. it's not 5* purely because of the actual software not the app itself. the customising of the invoice isn't great and adding previous invoices when you first start isn't great but if you're not worried about that it works well!
. the app syncs at install and the will not afterwards. this is probably the most important aspect of an app...to keep data in sync. do not waste time with this app. first delight, then ongoing frustration. terrible.
support. very sad that for a pay per month app does not work properly. have emailed support on numerous occasions with no response.
run my business anywhere.. i love this app. it allows me to run my business from anywhere. in construction i'm rarely in the office. now my smartphone has become my office. i couldnt run my business without this app. highly recommended.
. gr8 app
mobile app yes. i love being able to use the mobile app for quickbooks. you can't do everything you can online but it's great being able to knockout some tasks on the fly and i can show results in an instant, which is a good motivator.
. doesn't have my back in its list, so it's useless. i've cancelled my subscription. when i contacted support, they were obsessed with my subscription, rather than the actual issue.
". takes customer support weeks to respond, and even then, they have no idea what causes the many errors. be prepared to find work around and give up on certain functions. regret the decision to work with qbo. unable to sync with my data through app, after 3 days of ""engineers working on it"" (or are they off on the weekend even though your problem started onba friday?)"
. worst app website will not open properly in mobiles and ask for reset repeatedly for same user id, useless
. i've downloaded this app, uninstalled it, and reinstalled it and it will not allow me to create an account. it continually signs me out and i have to reenter all my information. i'm giving up!
incompatible with ios 9. this app is great in ios 8 and even supports touch id. however, it does not work in ios 9 and needs an immediate update.
will not export from pro to online. after 4 days working with quickbooks support they were not able to merge my company files over. very disappointed!
brilliant. best invoice app i've had
"awful app... can't even sign in. migrating to qb online so thought app would be great.. wrong! app won't sign in and reports 'communications error' in addition, it's not compatible with my 8"" tablet running android 5x  come on intuit  sort it out"
buggy. can't even login to my account. after i enter my username and password, the app clears the password field and doesn't login.
. really frustrated, do not buy this app through google, once you setup you account through good you can not upgrade you account or transfer it to a regular subscription. so i'm just stuck with what i have....
no es para argentina. bien pero no pude incluir los bancos
. kind of a rip off, squares a lot better allows the same things and you don't have to pay a monthly cost. and you don't have to pay for customer support for square. could be for other people just not for me.
worthless. i have never once been able to generate a p&l for a board meeting. the reporting function just does not work, which is the most useful part of accessing this program through a browser. also, even though i can enter a sales receipt, doing deposits from the + does not work and i am unable to make corrections that are relatively simple from the browser. this platform provides no service at all.
sync does not work. since the april 25th update bank sync is not working. i called tech support and they say they are working on it. no news yet after one week.
update. please fix soon app opens and closes after update.
love the app. excellent app just wish you guys would add the ability to turn on quantity while leaving rate off in estimates and invoices
. simple, fast and easy to use
ios 9. with the new os signatures on the iphone are no longer saved to invoices, instead the app just crashes. when people become dependent on specific features and then they stop working it leads to a lot of extra work. please fix this feature asap.
. great app
app ruined. come on!!!!! the app is totally unusable now. can't save invoices, can't email them to the right person and can't create them with the correct info. this is the type of screw up that someone should be fired over.
grateful for this software. i have an easy time figuring it out. overall i like this app. thanks would like to have a few other features like an easy way to delete mistakes. 102014. the customer support and tech support is awesone! fast, accurate and efficient! thank you.
can't attach images or accept signatures. really!!?? so many features i would have expected. track expenses, milage, accept signatures.
. very miss leading and is nothink like the tv advert. not to easy to use and over all disappointed. having to use it because of my accountant. no impressed!!!!
receipt camera. the camera update has made what was a relatively easy task into a complete guessing game
ouch. does not have my bank listed. does me no good. been paying for 1 year now. and i see no where how to stop subscribing. cost me over $10.00 a month.
able to view lots. able to view lots, but this app is not the same as the online version.
. for what i do this was a complete waste of money. . it was supposed to import all my all my spreadsheet and all that information over to my taxes when i signed up with tax turbotax or whatever it was. it doesn't nor did it. and now it keeps trying to charge me $60 for something after i cancel my subscription because all it did was make my taxes more complicated than they had to be.
app no longer works. everything was good with it for about 6 months now the app no longer allows me to log in saying there has been a security problem. other devices work told by quickbooks support it was being looked into 2 months ago and still nothing. very disappointed that i'm paying for this to not work
. great app
". checked this app out to see if it was good for my business. i was charged 7.99 for a ""free"" 30 day trial. decided it wasnt the right app for me. thanks for the 2 days i used it and was charged for. awesome!! (insert sarcasim here)"
not very user friendly.. not very user friendly. have to open the app twice every time i use it. it says critical updates required log out and log in to refresh. every. single. time. i . open. the. app. i’ve tried deleting and reinstalling multiple times. when entering receipts it could have a search box at the top of vendor list do you don’t have to ask to search every time.
excellent online software. i love this system made my job a lot easier my phone is my office
no too bad. this app for the self employed version is pretty good. using the ipad is less so, mainly because it will not rotate into landscape view and the appearance of the interface is slightly blurry  not sharp like other apple apps. the features though, on the whole are pretty good.
. great! simple to use & very professional...very satisfied wquickbooks!
major issues.. i am a plumbing contractor and mobility is so important. currently i have multiple estimates for the same customer. it would be great if i could search for an estimate by a job name or a po. right now if i want to look up a specific estimate i have to open and check every single one in hopes i find the right quote. need a better reference system to look up estimates and invoices.
"issues. it was working fine on my ipad up until last week. then starting bugging. not all customer transaction appear on the mobile app. called customer service about it. they told me that they were ""working on it"". we shall see. i pay for it monthly...i asked if i still had to pay this month even though it's not working as advertised...answer was yes. not happy with that answer. i will keep you posted. bob"
keshav. it is a beautiful software. very flexible and user friendly. it made my work so simple. thanks to quick books!
works great!. for an app this is very powerful and lets you know the basics on the run.
even worse after last update. didn't think the time loading could get any worse. i was wrong. ap is pretty much useless while with a customer. everything takes forever to load. need to sign in every. single. time. then you click out of the ap and right back in and it makes you use the touch id. super sucky. i very much dislike, yet i need to use it everyday. ugggggggg.
loving it. since the most recent update, i am loving this app!
good idea. i love the concept but i've had to reenter several expenses up to three times to get quickbooks to except them in and that's rather annoying.
. quickbooks online has been an invaluable management tool for my small business. i give professional estimates for services & am able to create invoices, receive payment, & track income, expenses, etc.
great little app. excellent app for basic book keeping invoicing etc and keep up with the book keeping on the fly. but to do the serious stuff you still need to work from a laptop or desktop.
not good. app and site are actually kind of bad. slow to load. not enough options. will try xero soon
great app. app is never up today's with invoices. the app has become useless to me other than being able to find customers phone numbers and addresses. please fix asap.
how did i run my business without it?. i do half my estimates and invoices on the go with this app. saves me so much time!
google calendar. it would be nice to be able to sync google calendar with the mobile app for invoices like you can do on the mac app.
. have had an issue with sending invoices through my app for the last 3 days. even after several calls and emails no one can tell me when this will be rectified. poor support and unorganized for such a large company.
not free. wish there was an app like this for free the soon i started free trial next step was if i wanted 3months and pay or have a small discount and still pay :
fantastic for on the go.. customers pay me and i put it right in the app. no waiting until i get home to forget. love this app.
brilliant!!!!. works like a dream with qb online. i can finish a job and then send the invoice from my phone (whilst sitting at home drinking a cuppa!). can you set up notifications for when an invoice is viewed by the customer?
brilliant and far reaching app. started using this app following another app which was not giving me the usability that i needed. this app is amazing in its flexibility and ease of use. get it and you won’t regret it.
amazing app to accompany an amazing program. i've been using quickbooks online along with the app for over a year. my business has never been more organized in regards to accounting. being able to access all of my information from my phone is a game changer. will give the app 5 stars when they implement a way to move items once added to an estimateinvoice.
. i use to love quickbooks but now it's not working anymore. please fix immediately because my whole business is run on this app... are you gonna fix this?
changed my life. very helpful and easy to use. now i am my own accountant and i can keep close track on everything i do. i love this app!
user friendly. this app is super easy to use
. game changer
amazing program. this is the best program for your company!
much better. used qbo several years ago and it was horrible. this is a really nice app. good job intuit.
um not to quick. over all i like it but there are just a few things i can't do in the app like remove invoices.
. worst customer service ever! they blocked my customer payment and i couldn't get any answer after two weeks and nobody is responsible.
absolutely fantastic!. this app is incredible. having been using for 6 months, and it has revolutionised the way we are able to do business. so easy to setup, use and understand. i highly recommend to anyone that needs an easy orderinvoicesales system for their business.
. connect to banking and reconcile in minutes. email invoices...so no snail mail.
login error. upgraded to an s7 and cannot login. i need the mobile app for my business!
app crashing in ios 13. please note that the app is crashes in ios 13. have not been able to open it sine updating. otherwise it is a fantastic application.
awesome app!. started my business with the start of this app since i'm a mobile mechanic and it's awesome to do quotes and invoices on the fly makes it easier to keep customers
. disappointed with the app. does not show payments posting to accounts within the past 24 hours. it showed payments posted 4 or more days.
best business app. easily the best business purposed app.
low rating until the app supports chart of accounts. the app continues to be undeveloped for functions that are developed in the web interface. the app is excellent for invoices and credit card transactions if you have a merchant account coupled to your qbo account. the camera can be used in app to document your receipts to the cloud and i use it extensively for hotelairfarerental car expenses and they can be attached to invoices when emailing your customers.
can't live without it. i don't know how i did business before this app. i love that i can access my company books anywhere. i love the way i can take a photo of the receipts for my expenses. thank you qb!
freakin awsome!!. every time i asked for certain features in future updates......they did it!!
comments. there is no printing options for mobile printing. we have tu use other app, to print invoices. poor in reports not friendly to do invoices
qb app. product has improved greatly since its first launch. still room for improvement. i wish you could add time activities like you can in the online version.
latest update crashing on iphone 7. app crashes 2sec after being turned on on iphone7. restarted phone, no luck
great app!. very useful and convenient app.
worthless app. i was excited to find this app and, unfortunately, downloaded it. i really cannot figure out what is good for other than creating invoices. confusing when you open the app, it does not get better as you get into it, not that there is anything to get into. i run a small non profit & just found this app useless, except for taking up space. what a pity as i have been a qb user for years.
no purchase orders. as of feb 2015, i'm unable to find a way to create purchase orders from this app. without the ability to raise orders for inventory, i cannot run my business, so the app is useless for me. seems handy, so i wish it worked properly.
fantastic app. easy to use and a great companion to the website version.
. great app and user friendly for small business.
great app only downfall is.... i like the app the only downfall is if your an employee you can't track your hours on here like you can with the qb on a computer.. also you can't delete a payment if you see you already added it. if so idk how to do these things.
lousy service. spent all morning trying to upload an expense only to be told i had no internet connection. can't it determine i have no server connection? so most of the morning i spent in one que after another and finally hanging up. i must say that the convenience of being mobile outweighed the inconvenience of not having too much versatility, but only if i am able to be mobile. i hate wasting time, and so i want payback.
. signed up 6 days ago for self employed package, although it says in the package i can use the app, when opening the app it states i have not signed up for it... emailed asking for help, no reply. scheduled a call back for tuesday 13pm, noone called. poor customer service. i will cancel and find another accountancy program.
no sync. only issue i have is that i cannot sync with the desk top version as far as entering information out on the field and have it sync to my laptop version.
touch id. the app works well once you've signed in, but the touch id still isn't working properly. you have to sign in manually first. then, it allows you to switch between apps using touch id to sign back in for a while. however, if you sign out completely, it appears you can't use touch id to sign back in again. i thought the whole purpose of touch id was to avoid having to enter your password each time and to increase security.
very good for any kind of business!. quickbooks is great app for managing the everyday finances. it's very fast to send invoices, with this app all income and expenses are simple and quick.
bad update. last update renders the app useless
great but needs some updates. just recently i am unable to log in to my company. i can get on to my online account, but not on the app?? says my email and password isn’t found?
. this app is not working with samsung note 9
copy & paste. we are unable to paste anything in quickbooks app if we copy anything from another app
kerry pabian. are you kidding me !!! app is crashing on my ipad since the update ! why do you always do updates right before its time to do billing ?
superb. this accounting system and the app have saved me so much time over the last six months. i used to dread calculating the vat return and catchup my up on the books but i am up to date daily with very little effort. well worth the money!
. awesome app. helps me keep on top of all of my accounting as i go and super easy to navigste. highly recommend.
perfect for my small business. i am a wedding photographer and quickbooks online is the best way for me to keep track of my expensesrentals and write up a quick invoice or estimate while i am on the road. i absolutely love how user friendly it is. as long as i have my smart phone i can work from anywhere.
. if you have to write off expenses for your business like meals, travel ect.....get this app now!!!! very simple and user friendly.
best version yet!!. i run a company with revenues over 2 million dollars annually with qb. i can take care of everything i need from invoicing, estimating and accounts payable to payroll and everything in between. the app adds even more flexibility by not requiring my laptop or tablet to create these. the reports and reconciliations are second to none.
why bother. why bother with the app? you get better features by using your web browser, even on your tablet. even still, the payroll functions are very cumbersome and don't work well, so a desktop is still required.
. it is a good program
. simple and easy to use
besi. it just makes life easier awesome app
great program for what is asked of it.. great program (i use desktop app on my macbook pro). but constant “improvements “ make it hard to find menus you once had. needs a one click solution to print all open invoices at once. biggest complaint is i get thrown off a few times a week. it’s a quick reload, and i have not lost any data, but annoying.
this might be 5 stars. the only thing... only thing!!! using square through the app .. or somehow sync invoices so they reflect in qb. if there is a way to do that then this is 5 stars!!
a great experience. this new update has just all the features required from this app and more. not just do you guys listen but act as well. kudos. the best cloud service, that can be.
great app. love using qb vs the other one i was using. well worth the money imo.
so. slow.. this app functions ok, i guess but it runs so slow! taking a receipt picture to enter an expense, for example, should be a quick and easy fast but the app moves so slow and it takes too many taps to complete such a simple task.
. hasn't worked in almost 3 weeks seriously, for such an important piece of software i'm shocked they haven't fixed this yet. i wish our small business didn't put everything on quickbooks, as this is terribly frustrating. how about giving us the previous version until it's fixed?
newest update doesn’t load dashboard. dashboard and home button do nothing now. iphone 11 pro max. blank screen.
. very useful. if can get it for eternity at one time payment and not to be paying monthly that would be nice.
. cannot change estimates from pending to accepted on android version.
crash issues. this app crashes on the new iphone 11 pro max using ios 13. please release updates to resolve the issue.
. expenses aren't quite as quick to enter as i'd hoped but way better than the alternative!
. this used to be a great app, i have used it for 4 years but unfortunately it is no longer working... i can no longer login, i keep getting an error saying it can't sync. i hope this gets fixed soon, i run 90% of my business from my phone and having a working phone app is part of the fee we pay for qb online.
chief operating officer. phenomenal software.
so so.. while intuit has made many improvements in the last few years the iphone app is virtually useless. the ipad version is a slight improvement but neither app allow access to the most commonly accessed information. oh well.
looking for another software. they always have “50% off” that’s just to get you because i have a year with them and it is the 3rd. time they had raised the price ! i’m now looking for another software.
india is not mentioned. sorry to say that but i uninstalled the app in 3mins because india as a nation is not mentioned.
desktop to online user. qb desktop user who switched to qbo. really like the ability to use on all my computers and ios devices. just wish it would have easier reports to make and use. no time sheets feature in ios, tsheets by quickbooks fills that void.
highest return on investment expense i declared as an llc. i honestly believe that quickbooks has help me get to where i am today! i am proactive and proud!
. mr 5 jobs omg its freakin awesome program
. takes some time to kearn but very good companion to the full cloud app for the laptop
great. does everything i need, and in an extremely convenient way.
very useful. just as fluid as the full version on my pc. easy to use, and can generate invoices quickly..
no purchase orders. for years now quickbooks has withheld the ability to create purchase orders through the mobile app. this is a huge issue for our company and it is quite frustrating that qb has willfully omitted this feature. i wish there was a way to convince qb to change course on this decision...
user friendly. this app is simple to use, easy to grasp, and professional in presentation.
. rubbish interface, doesnt send invoices when you press send, had multiple invoices paid late due to this, will be looking for a decent online app to run my business. how can an invoice be overdue if my customer never received it because the app sent it? how do i tell if my estimates have actually been sent? its extremely unprofessional having to contact my customers and ask them if they've recieved invoices and expenses because this software is not up to scratch.
excellent app for small business!. i have to say that i have ised several versions of quickbooks however; the quickbooks online is the best yet!
. i'm on the go a lot and being able to access qb online from my mobile lets me access and do things quickly and efficiently. i'm able to create invoices and see who owes me money. it's great
excellent. i like the flexibility of quickbooks. i use it on my iphone, ipad and desktop. always synced no problems with it. couldn't manage without it.
. indian user is not allowed
. works as advertised, simple to use and learn.
excellent. quickbooks online works great for me and makes my work much easier especially with the phone app
the best app ever. now we can run our business with this app.very convenient and easy to use.
tricked. had to provide all my email and phone information before being told it was a free trial, felt tricked, if you want to save money doing your books you don't want to pay for an app to help you, just learn to do it yourself for free
invoices and estimates design. the design and layout of the invoices and estimates templates are outdated. seems like a small thing, but it reflects poorly on a business’ brand, and it is so easily fixed on your end. hire a professional designer and give clients a template that says quickbooks cares about our brand too.
. really handy app, does what it says on the tin lol
. great app works well fore
service is great to use but.... i do like the service but don’t like that they have increased pricing 3 months me into using the services. now i have to transfer all my data to another program since i do not like the increase.
. 😃snooth and always there. doesn't matter where i am. if i have data quickbooks are there for me.
great mobile execution. this is a great extension of qb online and includes the same userfriendly interface. it makes sending invoices on the go a breeze. love it!
. awesome app for small business owners that need to be on the move.
garbage. signed up to their free trial, spent hours putting up my receipts only to be told i have to start again because of an error at their end. now locked out of my account and all my original receipts have faded taking even more hours trying to communicate with them to gain access to my account
worst user experience. app is made of complex processes..i they are more focused on collecting data than providing service..uninstalled within 3 minutes
easy to use, powerful, brilliant. managing everything on the run is important... with quickbooks i can do pretty much everything i need from my mobile saving me valuable time! only thing i would request is an apple watch app.
horrible. crashes every time. horrible customer service. move on to another app.
crap!. can't create an invoice in the app that has cis? really? why not? so i can't do my invoices on the go?! rubbish app rubbish system! use another programme!
excellent app for small biz on the go. invoice from anywhere. super easy.
. great app! the ability to update my account regesters on the go would make it a 5 star app.
. brilliant software i have never been so organised and my life is better knowing what my financial situation is whenever i want
. awesome app for lawyers
. crashes each time it opens.
time saver & ease of access. if you don't have the app for your small business account already, well you better just click download now! it saves me hours of computer time each week and my clients get the necessary paperwork even when i'm on a job site working. invoicing and inputting receipts has never been easier!
great app. the app takes a bit to get used to but once you've played with it a bit it's very simple to navigate, update bank transactions and so on
great app. it's a one stop accounting app for me and it's made my life so much easier having it.
new update. i love the app and it has been great for us for years. however, the new update does not allow a custom date range for reports and when you edit an invoice it gives you a small screen that not everything fits on. please bring back the custom date range and make is so we can see everything on edits.
. great app
last update killed this app. i can't even.... will wait for the next update g to then i can't use it.
absolutely awful. first i was billed twice for it and then between the app and my laptop i can't fully edit fields or get it to sync with square. now it won't even let me cancel and delete it's terrible service. awful. awful. awful. steer clear
access to qb contacts please. love this app, means i can work while out with the kids. would be better if my phone was allowed access to my quickbooks contacts as my husband adds the contacts and they call before i have chance to add them to my phone.
background usage accounts for 50 percent of battery life. this app completely drains my battery. i thought my battery was broken and was about to replace it, but apple tech report suggested i check on battery usage by app and i discovered quickbooks was the culprit.
. love it kindly introduce an app for the managers too. which shows reports.
. ease of use. ability to send professional estimatesinvoices from anywhere. the ability to load price list makes creating estimates and invoices easy.
unable to download. i am trying to download the app but could not
the invoice customization need big improvement. if you define customization mean capability to make different invoice like different logo diferent information on footer etc. i have to diferent areas of service in my company that use a diferent logos and footer information but quick book on line not work like the desktop version in this part. please fix that !!!!!
convenience is nice. nice to be able to access clients remotely and get most information. would be nice to have full functionality in app. some functions are slow going from screen to screen.
this has made my life infinitely easier!. intuitively designed, have yet to need a feature it doesn't have!
jays. subscription
very helpful business tool. small construction business, i can do all my basic bookkeeping at lunch hour with this app
loveland ohio small business owner. love quickbooks. new users starting july 2012. it has helped keep things organized and if i mess up or question, which i have, their help people are awesome in working with me to explain or even help me undo my errors. kudos to the team trainers who trained the team and kudos to the team's who are patient with us on the phone calls!!!!
. great app. i love it
rubbish. doesn't work. need to add bills but can't. how ridiculous to not have this function. deleted. no support from customer service
. quickbooks makes it so easy to keep track of expenses, invoices, payments, mileage... everything really. i'm glad i chose this over the other options.
. very nice system. very easy to use. i would like to be able to pull more reports and have more options in the mobile app.
keeps on getting better. has been very useful and absolutely love the new ui.
phoned in. this could be such a cool extension, but like a lot of qb online, it feels a bit phoned in.  expenses show without account coding  what's the point?  report viewing is limited  dashboard is not customizable
it’s great. although this program works incredibly well and i’m happy to of used it for the past two years… i would love to do an annual subscription, pay my payment once a year and carryon.
desperate for mobile. same as when i tried it in 2012. devoted qb online user, but this app is useless to me. this app may help sales people, but does nothing for management. no banking, no reporting, no transactions.
quickbooks is very refined. the app works great and is easy to use
a changing life app. i’m new to the u.s and this app helps a lot to get organized. just love it.
. makes my life as a designer and contractor so much easier
love new layout. love this app it allows me to create invoices and receipt on the go with tablet or phone
bugs. after updated ios 13, it’s not working. please fix the bugs.
great app. very helpful, only complaint is, i would like more features like the desktop version. i would like to be able to get into my online version and accept register transactions, look at taxes that are owed, stuff like that. but over all a huge time saver. and has gotten me out of some tight spots. thank you
subscription errors. nothing but problems since january. i switched from the download to the app so i could do it at home and it's been nothing but problems, and not even the same ones!!! i have 2 companies, it's june, and i'm still trying to get this straightened out to input this years data.
. app no longer works at all. i've tried uninstalling & reinstalling nothing. i've left emails for qb to contact me regarding this and no response. not looking good for them right now
. can't create an account. fails every time. can't update due to server failure. no support available either.
. doesn't work for the last few months on any of my devices. called many times support and they said they are aware of the problem and they are working on it. this is insane!!! i'm paying every month to get the online version and it doesn't even let me sign in. it shouldn't take month to fix such a problem.
invoicing on the go!. the app is a great companion to the online version. allows me to invoice and keep track of billable items on the go. there is so much more it does but for me invoicing right after the job is done gives me freedom to do my office work while having a coffee.
can't offline book keeping.. it's terrible that you can't add expenses when offline. the app needs internet constantly and that's very frustrating as lots of my business is outside of network. basically the app is useless if you don't have internet!
. it does, what i needed to do
junk update = worthless app. since the latest update, my qb app shows an error saying that my session has expired immediately after i log in. i can't use it at all. pc access is okay.
bad update. can no longer accept credit card payments. keep getting error code 6000. tech support advised this is a known issue but no eta on fix. please revert back to previous version.
. great app, makes paperless billing a breeze for a small company.
"app now totally dead, cannot login at all.. can't login anymore, giving a weird ""suspicious activity detected"" error and refuses to login, running android 5.0. works fine on my pc, osx laptops and ios devices. this is a known problem on android. see this https:community.intuit.comquestions1281477cannotloginmobileapp. still can't create purchase orders on android or ios! that's almost a deal breaker for me. i can search for items while creating invoicesestimates in android  but not ios?"
where's the touch password?. i use keychain so my quickboks password on my mac is super random, with dashes and strange symbols. i use quickbooks on my iphone so i can quickly add expenses when on the road and don't have a mac nearby. please add the touch password feature back in so the iphone app is convenient again.
. awesome app
best choice for modern businesses. quickbooks online (qbo) could be a challenge for those resistant to change, or those not looking to grow their business. but for business owners hungry for dynamic, realtime financial data to both interpret and grow their businesses, qbo is key. the combination of qbo and integrated applications (tailored to your specific industry and workflow) aid in gaining efficiencies which eliminating redundancies, manual data entry and a few other timesaving and (human error) opportunities. highly recommended.
app. best app
time saver. saves time to be able to categorize expenses from my phone.
love qbo it's fantastic.. this app rocks. i can see they are adding more features.
. to slow
. so slow to picture receipts and save as a note!!! just scanning 6 invoices took about 20 minutes. nightmare.
awesome. one of the best apps i have used for tracking and creating invoices, keeps me on track and easy to use.
very handy.. great app for when i'm away from my pc and need to sort invoice or sort my accounts.
". generally very good, one problem when sending invoices it says ""invoice number"" as opposed to saying actual invoice #. not an issue if sending from pc."
dig it!. i mainly use the app for looking at financials, but the invoicing, reporting, and such is great too.
. does not have inventory images in app. please add this feature.
. love this app. life has gotten so much more organized and business transactions so much easier
. no problems... works as advertised. no crashes.
. this app is perfect for my business. love it!
quickbooks all the ways. great product, services, app
from xero to quickbooks. i went from sage line 50 (blinkin' expensive but brilliant if your an accountant) to xero (very good for basic invoices but no estimate facilities on the app, no good for my job) to quickbooks online. easy to use. does what i need. reliable and relatively quick.
. i've been trying to use this app for months and months. it doesnt work, and nobody has done anything about the problems even though there are numerous complaints and bad reviews. i'm getting ready to stop paying for quickbooks and find something else. i mainly wanted to us the app for taking pictures of receipts, but due to the syncing issues, i can't submit more than one receipt picture without the app hanging or freezing. i've tried reinstalling, clearing cache, etc. with no luck.
ios 11 glitch. hi. since i upgraded to ios 11 the qb app does not allow me to do split transactions. this is a major glitch for me as most transactions are split. please can you get on to this as soon as possible. as a user of intuit software for nearly 20 years i know you'll fix this. thanks for great software.
good but could be better. overall quickbooks online is a reliable usable and productive app. it continues to lack obvious things like an ap screen on the landing page and better shortcuts to accounts. but it does the job well.
absolutely love it! best business accounting app. great mobile online app tool that syncs with your online quickbooks on both mac and pcs. is everything that you could ever want or need for bookkeeping, accounting, invoicing and estimates.
. very easy to use, takes little effort to keep track of all your sales and spending. i do wish it had a spot to put miles withought buying the mile version though.
go payment and expenses. needs expense entry and to integrate with go payment to get 5 stars. 61014  5 stars. thank you. great features. great app.
better than tinder. good app.
. great app does exactly everything i need for my small business.
pretty good. app is pretty good for on the fly.
login will not allow me to paste my password. i use quickbooks online, so i use a very strong password that is stored in an app (1password). it would be extremely annoying to hand type a 25 character random password into this app. and i'm unwilling to compromise my security for my online financial data. therefore this app is totally useless to me.
handy. the mobile app is very convenient for entering expenses on the go. you can add photos of receipts and create new customers and suppliers easily. profit & loss and balance sheet function gives you a quick snapshot of your business. overall, the app is quite handy to use for small businesses.
. better on desktop, was hard to use
. doesnt support android.
aplicación útil y práctica. el uso de la aplicación es fácil e intuitivo y permite controlar casi todas las funciones de la versión web. en mi opinión lo único que falta es la capacidad de hacer tareas offline. esto sería de gran ayuda para avanzar el trabajo cuando estás sin conexión (en un avión por ejemplo) y también es importante que se amplíe la posibilidad de conectar con más bancos, el mío no está disponible ahora y eso es una carga de trabajo extra. enhorabuena
amazing. this app is great men, u should try it...
works great!. i am a new business owner and i have qb online on my pc, ipad and iphone. it is great to be able to record expenses and take photos of the receipts right when it happens rather than waiting until later and possibly forgetting. no issues found so far!
just easy. safe and secure . superb app ..
amazing. life is just easier. especially when it constantly always making updates just making it easy so i can focus.
quick books. quick easy invoices
. so far the ability to track expenses has been extremely easy and seamless.
good program. works different than internet. that causes some head aches.
great app.. can do everything while on the move.
won't sign in, incorrect subscription error.. like the title says, can't login tells me my subscription may have expired. i can log in through website easily.
. we tried the free trial before purchasing.. quick books keeps changing my partially paid invoice to paid in full .. when i called tech support he told me to fix this problem its 129.00he was rude and started to raise his voice after i started hows it possible i have to pay that much for a free trial app when they are the ones causing the problem... quick books is no good.. and their tech support is the rudest customer service i've ever heard!
qbo app. luv the new dashboard!! excellent app. no complaints.
fantastic accounting app. i love that this allows me the freedom to work and to monitor my accountant's progress on the go. it's extremely user friendly and easy to use. many features save tons of time on simple book keeping tasks. smashes traditional softwares like ubs and myob into the dust!
limited features. good app but still too many features missing that require logging in to the website. e.g. vat and paying salaries as expenses.
great for handyman businesses. qb is great for me! i run a handyman business and my office is at my clients place or in my truck. i can sent estimatesinvoices while i am on site. it so nice because i use my tablet or phone when i’m on the road and when i’m home i can use qb on my computer and everything is automatically updated
. app is pretty good.
good for invoices. the mobile app doesn’t have all options from the desktop app. and it’s something that makes sense... i mostly use the mobile app to check on invoices status. also the alerts ... it sent notification when an invoice is paid, and some basic information as well.
excellent for doing my accounts. this company is excellent i have a taxi company i can do my accounts online and why am waiting for customers if i have any problems they always solve them very quickly i would highly recommend
no support from quickbooks is brutal. there's no support options provided from quickbooks directly. that's a very poor customer experience, especially when paying $100s per year for this platform. the online community is somewhat helpful, but you're relying on contributions from other random users being accurate, which they may not be. please step up, quickbooks.
recent update. crashes frequently! if editing an estimate or invoice on ipad it opens in a floating window that can slide down into the abyss and all progress is lost! very unhappy with the latest update!
"it doesn't synchronize. the app is totally unusable. it doesn't synchronize customers and supplier and the transaction with those missing from the list result as incomplete. tried also to dis install and reinstall: same story. on top of this it must also said that the assistance is unresponsive, many days and repeated enquiries to finally get emails full of irritating smileys and useless answers like ""we are constantly improving the apps to serve our mobile customers""."
mixed bag and ball and chain. a great improvement over the years but the system breaks down at the worst times. today(friday) could not access any of the program for 4 hours. no invoices. no purchase orders. yikes!! when it works, it works well.
100% broken. they must have changed something with the login process. i only get a message saying it's for online users (which i am) and not mac and windows users. cannot even login anymore.
quickbooks online is great. i love being able to add expenses while on the road. i appreciate the snapshot of where my business is performing. it is great to have a record of what’s going on!
. i am a quickbooks proadvisor. i started qbo and am getting used to it. the mobile app has really improved! thanks intuit. always love how you really care about what we experience.
great for dummies. wife told me i had to get more organized with my billing. i went down kicking and screaming but she was right!! program works great on my phone and ipad. super easy to use.
. they said in your invoice that you can cancel anytime and it's not true! it has a glitch and i couldn't cancel it. make me lost two days trying to cancel it and then even charge me the month and did not give back my money. they went from 17 dollars a month to 40 dollars per month! don't never quickbooks
. doesn't seem to let me login with my google account as i do on the website. not sure how i should login in this case.
. app no longer loads. error returned from client
fantastic app. as a contractor to be in the field instantly give my customers and estimate or full fullblown bid and be able to follow up with change orders and billing all in one spot. very convenient easy to use and it works great on my phone , home computer, or ipad all at the same time. highly recommend this product not had one problem with it to date.
great!. as a first time business owner and user of any accounting software, i am very happy with quickbooks on the whole and this app in particular. easy to use and understand without over simplifying what needs to be done. seamless integration without just about any software make this a great goto for all your small business accounting needs.
crashes. the app just crashes as soon as it starts to load. don't waste your time downloading it.
this app will do the trick whenever you are on the go. i have been working with quickbooks online quite sometime and i like so far . the app is very convenient and simple which is great our busy schedule. thanks debora s
quickbooks user. enjoy most of the features but absolutely drives me insane that it doesn’t auto save. i’ll be working on a project get a phone call my ipad shuts down and i lose hours worth of work.
paid for itself in one hour. after a long, frustrating search for a robust but simpletouse accounting platform for my growing fitness business, i came across quickbooks and have been exuberant ever since. my invoices go out on time, expenses go in live, and it even tracks my inventory. paid for itself in the first hour. highly recommend.
great app. this has transformed my business. it is so easy to use that i now do my accounting on my cell phone.
not happy. this application is cheap at first, but then the price rises, now i'm paying like 30 a month, that's a lot, i found applications that are completely free.
great but i need.... to be able to apply discountsclient credits when creating an invoice on the app. add that and it will be perfect. for some reason the code doesn't allow for negative numbers when creating invoices in app, but on the computer it works just fine. thanks!
great app even a green horn can use.
. great app
crashes when trying take credit cards. crashing on 2018 ipad pro. multiple times
. limited bank support. no good for personal finance. not many german banks supported.
app isn’t working now. please advise. it has stopped working. i click on the app and it automatically closes. new iphone today should work unless not compatible with ios13.
not bad, but needs improvement. this app is good but needs improvement. improvements are mostly needed with the bank connections. i have to constantly tell my clients to update their login information in quickbooks for their bank accounts. this makes it's frustrating and time consuming for me and my clients. the app should also make it easier to do the same things as the web version.
incomplete functionality. there's no way to run a report, print it to a pdf and mail it to someone, or even save the report to storage, as far as i can see. i'm on the road, want to send the balance sheet to one of my colleagues, but can't see any way to do this from the app.
game changer. changed the way i handle my business transactions. from a simple to complex my invoices and estimates are presentable, traceable and accounted for. my reports help me secure loans in a flash. and my accountant loves me.
. fantastic app to keep track of all my construction expenses, so much simpler being able to log expenses straight from phone.
unable to sign in.... same issue many users are having with the latest update, i can no longer sign into my account with the app.
. i've had nothing but trouble with this app. i've sent numerous error reports made several attempts to contact customer support with no reply.
good app. haven't had a problem with this app.
does what i need. app is easy to navigate and has all functionality i am looking for.
. can do a lot quickly. like most apps doesn't allow you to do everything you can do on full site. great for adding invoices on the go.
. i am totally dissatisfied with qb small business app and quickbooks in general. i'm also using an android and having the same syncing problem. i will be cancelling my subscription with quickbooks altogether and will be going with one of their competitors. it has been a waste of my time with all the phone calls with their technical support in the philippines who gave totally incorrect information about the issue which was clarified when i spoke to customer service in sydney.
. very easy for emailing estimates.
. i have been using this app for few years now and i love it.
. awesome app makes invoicing and tracking payments easy
waste of space. all we want to do is access quick books online via our ipads. this app is worthless. as my business continues to grow we will obviously be looking for a software provider that listens to clients instead of putting out disappointments like this. save the space on your ipad and don't bother.
. i like this app so easy to use i recommend
disappointed. i just switched from my trusty iphone to an android phone, this app on my iphone was perfect! it had a list of products and services, unlike the android version. it also loaded all the estimates and invoices for all my customers, this android version hardly has any of my past transactions! please make this like the ios app!
. i have not been able to log into the app. i keep receiving an error message indicating i need to install the latest version, but it is already installed. i even attempted uninstalling and reinstalling, to no avail.
. cant function without it wonderful all in one app for small businesses
more than annoyed..... new update: 8916, still have to enter my password every time i open the app. touch id or app pin what is that??? 🤔 this is so annoying.... especially in front of customers!! tired of wasting my time. i've deleted and reinstalled the app to no avail. it appears you guys are never going to get it right....
. great app for small business. easy to use and saves me a ton of time doing my accounting. accounts payable and receivable couldn't be easier. i really like the free bank transfer option i can provide my customers in their invoices. taxes are quicker and easier thanever everything is in one place and no more collecting receipts. i highly recommend quickbooks to anyone running a small business.
. this is a great app! makes billing expenses and invoicing so much easier!
. after eading all the problems and seeing 90% of the reviews being 1 star im going to save a headache on this scam app should be taken off the market or sued for false advertising and costing people thousands of dollars. all the responses from support sound like they are prewritten for the complaints. please take app off the market and quit ruing the admin side of peoples hard work to start a business.
subscription error can't download app now. stuck... help!
. can no longer open app, error returned from client
good functionality but slow to load. great functionality, good app but it takes too long to load. i don't need the homescreen with current activity to load each time. i just want to add an invoice.
doesn't work. app crashes on load and while logging in. pretty useless so far. :(
"update broke the app. since the update i have to type my password each time i open it after it has been closed for a while. this doesn't work in front of customers. (yes, i enabled touchid. the problem seem to be hitting others and is based on now intuit decided to ""fix"" touchid by breaking it in this version)"
great support. we use the app almost exclusively to keep our business mobile. recently had an issue and contacted customer chat to get it resolved. they had me screen record it happening and said they would push to engineering for fix. honestly didn’t expect anything fast but they fixed the issue and included it in the new patch. it’s been about a week or less so a big thank you the support teams for getting it fixed and getting us back to normal.
. overall is a very good app. the only issue that i have right now is that i can't print wallet checks on the online version.
. very go app for on the go
dashboard is broken. app needs work.. the app dashboard appears to throw up numbers completely unrelated to reality and almost always reports inability to retrieve all data. the web version, on the other hand, works fine. it seems not much attention has been put into app development. disappointing.
great tool!. does everything i need for a small business in a convenient format.
easy as pie. certainly has improved my business
. does everything i need. very easy to use.
top notch app for businesses. makes it so easy to run my business on the go!!!!
awesome. i love how simple it is to create an invoice on the go. this app is definitely essential for any small business owner.
perfect. best thing going! i love being able to invoice on the move
. nexus 10 getting better with every update.
unclear and sneaky. nowhere in the app did it say that i needed a different product if i’m selfemployed. so i signed up and paid for my first month without knowing that it wasn’t the right one. i’ve paid double the amount i needed to and not even used it and never will use it. a waste of money. not happy at all.
does not even log into my company. installed the app, entered my login details then tells me sorry it cannot download my company details and to report issue. i've reported and typically the response i get back is to redownload the app???
owner. love this app work great.
. they just did a huge update and didn't change any of the items i'm having problems with. the app is useless to me with line items abbreviated. how do i know what i'm entering?
basic functionality is good. this app has a lot of the data that i want to see. limitations are that you cannot do queries or make selections like the online version. i would like it to look and work more like the online version, then i would rate it 5.
great flexibility. love being able to do estimates and invoices on the go.
not compatible with my lg g4 phone. i bought new lg g4 and installed the app on it, once i try to sign in the app crashes , i sent email to customer service and it has been three months since then, they keep saying we are trying to solve the issue, worst customer service ever.
. doesn't actually show invoices or customers. features are mostly broken or sporadic. using the website is a much better option.
can't save an invoice since update.. please fix asap. i use to use this app everyday and now i can't. i love quickbooks but this is bad!!
. app keeps closing right after opening even after uninstalling and then installing and also clearing app cache and data. the only update available to me is the 19.5.2
. easy to use and simple to edit
great app. this app makes it so easy for me to stay on top of my business. would recommend it to anyone that has a business and wants to know where it is financially.
very convenient!. this app has saved me on so many occasions. being able sending invoices and estimates onthego is awesome.
my business has transformed.. i have received multiple compliments from my customers regarding my new invoices and estimates.
excellent. i love the immediate accessibility of our business's financial position. no need for me to meet with the bookkeeper and accountant nearly as often. i haven't had any issues with the app.
not enough!. this app does not have the functionality that qbo has. therefore, useless. if we can't use the ipads in the store, what use is the app? 1. can't enter an invoice with the details 2. can't enter a vendor bill and do splits. 3. can't put payments in undeposited funds. 4. yep, useless.
not happy with new update. new update has made navigating to the chart of accounts very annoying. you have to access one of 3 accounts (determined by qbs) that show up on the main page and then push the back button, magically the accounts list appears. poor design, but a simple fix. i don’t mind that the menu button has moved to the bottom, just please add a “chart of accounts” link. thanks.
very well designed. since the dawn of tablets i’ve been patiently waiting for tablets and apps to be able to handle larger programs. because of quickbooks easy and convenient app. i have converted my business to all ipads. it has not only been an amazing tool for time management and popping out quick quotes. but is a big reason into my cost savings going from expensive laptops to ipads.
please add more search options. this is a great app to accompany a great service. my only request is that i be able to search for content within invoices themselves. for faster lookup!
getting better. you can keep doing more and more on phone. great for us small business owners. it would be 5 but when i first downloaded there was not a lot to transactions you could complete on app.
". the information syncs between the app & the quickbooks online because it's all saved in the ""cloud"". i used a more primitive system before this and wasn't sure how it would work, but i must say that i wish i'd done it years ago. i love quickbooks online. the desktop version is a bit easier to use, so i input from there and access the information whilst i'm out on my phone. it's really easy to resend invoices or quotes whilst i'm out. awesome!"
simply slow. i talked to 300 people and they all say it’s just the program itself
great job!. now i know when an invoice has been emailed. very complete app! now we just need a bulk action.
. love this app!! so simple and extremely convenient.
not bad needs a little work. online is getting better with each update. i love the update with the option to deposit money in different accounts
. i use this app all the time.
great app. very easy to use voice to text is amazing can't believe i hadn't done this sooner.
i love it. i'm. to sure why all the negative reviews unless intuit has just improved that much i. the past few weeks. i've not had any issues not seeing changes made in the ipad version vs the full online version. the only limitation i've seen is the inability to manage inventory levels on the ipad but i'm sure that feature will be available soon enough!
. quick books online asking me to update app through website .... will not open. says to email you the results or error and someone will get back to me.... not yet been 5 days
. good app. like the integration with online accessable pc version.
quickbook. i like it very much when making a invoice for a new customer you can just get all info transfered out of contacts. also helps keep your sales entered in real time
". pretty much a steaming pile of frustration. don't use it to record invoice pmts. the app will apply the payment not to your chequing account, or the account of your choice, but to some weird account called ""unapplied amount""."
so close. please add the ability to create sharable links to invoices from the mobile app. that would be incredible
. as someone who is constantly on the go, i have minimal access to a desktop computer. this app makes it easy to invoice and record payments right from my phone whether i can make it to the office or not
. having a business that is mobile and takes cash payments this app is brilliant. can't find a way to automatically assign mileage to each sales receipt... that would be invaluable!
business at a glance. for the detailed stuff, i like to stick to the desktop version, but for quickly seeing the status of invoices  profit and loss, the mobile app is great.
. the app is good. they can still work on some parts to make user experience better.
crashes. upgraded to ios 10, now app will no open.
not to happy. to many glitches
love qb online. i love everything about it. my favorite features are the qb app and being able to process bids and invoices from my phone! and being able to accept online payments thru the invoicing feature is awesome too.
. useful when you are on the go and need to access you financial records.
awesome cloud computing. this is great! i’ll never have to worry about whether or not i have a valid backup of my company data (as i did on the desktop version). my data is safely in the cloud and accessible to me from any device with internet access that i choose! tracking of income and expense easy here through the mobile app with access to reconciliation on the full web version. easy to use!
. i have seen personal budgeting apps that have better user experience than this. here just some of the glaring issues:  it forces you to relogin alot, and it does not support google signin, which means you have to retype a complex password every single time  you could use pin login from settings, but it is useless..  it forces pin code reentry everytime you use the camera or switch to another app.
. very easy to use this program and sell explanatory. makes everything simple and painless.
great app for on the go bookkeeping. i really enjoy having mobile access to my books.
money grabber. quickbooks will offer subscription service. i paid for it because of the discount and then they didnt allow me to accept payments through their app. you have to assess the profile first before asking for payment.
. absolutely awful and useless in every single way. beyond awful and useless. everything is hard to do. everything takes forever to get done. it always crashes and has constant glitches.
qbo app. useless app, does not present a desirable layout compared to the the online version, in the banking area, to the bank register. somewhat comparable to using another account program.
how did i run my business without it?. i do half my estimates and invoices on the go with this app. saves me so much time!
easy to use, no enough control. the app looks great and is easy to use. it does not however, give me basic options. one example is that i can't seem to add the cost of materials and labor for an item that i sell. only the price of the sale. i have to manually add in expenses for each item. it's tedious and doesn't give me a good reading of how my business is doing.
new update fail to open. just updated and app will not open
awesome app!!. seamless and intuitive. can accomplish so much with this app. thank you!!
subscription errors. nothing but problems since january. i switched from the download to the app so i could do it at home and it's been nothing but problems, and not even the same ones!!! i have 2 companies, it's june, and i'm still trying to get this straightened out to input this years data.
. great app for accounting
makes handling my business easier.. enjoy the invoice and payment features and reports, plus the app. makes my life much easier.
. even though i canceled my subscription 1 month ago, it still continues to withhold money from me.
. good app but even just a few days in i can see areas the app needs improvement
. great app i love it
it's a win. if your a small business like me, this app is a must.
mileage tracker. any chance you can put a mileage tracker on this app? other wise it's perfect for small business
quick books online is the best solution when your on the road. i have to be out of town and need the ability to interface with my main office and keep everything updated qbo does it simply!
. love to be available to quote, inovice, charge, see my clients, etc. on the go. i just have a few times that wasn't available to log in but overall good app
fantastic. i love this app! it's very useful
couldn't do without it. the qb on line version has really simplified our operations. the ability to have multiple users from different locations, especially remote access, has made life easier. either using a laptop or my ipad is great when out of the office. the only thing i've found that the app does not allow me to do is prepare a purchase order. but, there seem to be periodic updates so hopefully this will be coming soon. i would recommend qb to any small business.
. issue with app was directed in app to call quickbooks online customer service. no solution after being on the phone for 2 hours, they ended up calling android and at&t to try and fix the issue, which made absolutely no sense to me and got us nowhere. customer service has no clue about anything app related including when the password reset does not send verification code. i ended up having a different company to resolve the issue for me. below instructions solved nothing.
. easy to use and make life way easier to keep track of inventory and sales.
. we went from pro 2012 to the online version it easy and the android app works very well i can now run my business from under a fishing brolly if i want a day out,! updated, one thing that needs looking at is a ' restore' point i made a mistake and deleted a file with no back up available! can we have a back up please?
. excellent app. the one i use most on my smartphone.
mobile version. please make purchase order option available for mobile version. i can't send purchase order to vendors from the app
limited functionalty. the app has limited functionality, can't see transaction details of any expenses and income accounts; can only see the assets and was told to use the browser version. can't drill down from a report to see the details of the transactions. touch id login is handy. so it's better to just use the browser version.
crashes. a lot.. new upgrade crashes. a lot. allowed me on just long enough to click 'leave a review'. then crashed. again.
. it works well for my small biz. very happy.
. doesn't have my back in its list, so it's useless. i've cancelled my subscription. when i contacted support, they were obsessed with my subscription, rather than the actual issue.
. simple and convenient
great invoicing app. works great for invoicing needs.
disappointing update. was able to do deposit on the go with earlier version. please fix.
does not work for android any more. after months of calling customer service sending id ,still no luck . app does not work with android phones,it logs in but it's nothing there because it does not want synchronise,so i have my account with no details in it ,except profit and loss. so if any wants to use the app with android phone and have a data on the web do try it .
. amazing app
not trustworthy. quickbooks has some issues with taking multiple accounts under the same email. i can not access my account because my email was used to open a second trial and i can not access my data any longer. choose better accounting software, overall. this app has no visible way to logout or troubleshoot.
waiting time.. impossible to connect it on my samsung tablet. very disappointing.
invoice and estimates not saving after last update. you will have to delete app. then reinstall then it will save.
quickbooks online. fantastic easy way to invoice and keep in touch with customers on the go
unreliable. i don't advice anybody to download this app it had a major problem since two months and till now not solved.
. since the most recent update i cannot see my dashboard or add expenses to my company. fix it. done all diagnostic steps so this update is invalid. galaxy s10+ here
great app but. i have been using the desktop 2012 version and have been used to navigating that. the online version would do well to have a more compatible and similar version for experienced users.
need ipad update. the ipad app should be as capable as the desktop version. when are we going to see this? iphone app is pretty stout but the ipad app needs update and soon.
great app. love the details and ability to invoice or add customers on the go!
high hopes cause big fails. the app crashes all of the time. no integration with desktop versions but ok. i though i would have something on the go for small invoices. i can't get through the first invoice. all progress gets lost with the crashes. i love how much time i save with the desktop version. there customer service has always been terrible. they can't even have a fully working version for the trial period. fail!
great app. i personally find the app easier then the desktop version. everything is quick and easy to do. raise an invoice or estimate instantly and see your bank account balance. great.
great app...does what it says.. just started to use, and i am loving it!
almost great. this app would be better if it had a little more functionality. i would love to be able to upload photos to invoices or even send an invoice from the app. i find myself not really using the app very much because it does not have full functionality. it would be nice if qb could mirror their web based app.
. major issues with app and desktop versions. back and forth calls to solve the issues. finally gave up and cancled. on the plus side, customer support on the phone was polite. however, the product itself isn't worth the trouble. this will be the third time i have called in asking about my refund, its been almost 2 months... still waiting.
very useful mobile app. i don't expect my mobile version (android) to replace my desktop version. for checking customer balances, emailing invoices, and receiving payments it's a perfectly useful app. quick and easy access to invoices, customer balances, expenses, customer info, p&l and balance sheet. i'm not running or expecting more sophisticated reports from my phone! works great for what i need!
. all new version is awesome this app is awesome! when intuit separated the quickbooks mobile app from this quickbooks online app they fixed a bunch of bugs and added a ton of features. if you have a quickbooks online subscription you need this app!
. like it but doesn't seem like it syncs with my phone app.
oakes firewood llc. great app! love it! easy and fast to use. good job!
ideal for small business. very user friendly and i phone friendly too
. great app for small businesses...needs some improvements in some areas
app has low functionality. quickbook rocks but the app has very limited functionality leaving it as something not helpful to review reports
works well. great app, easy to see what's going on at a glance
changed my world in a good way!. simple, intuitive, any device, anywhere. let's me do my accounting on the fly instead of working though a pile of admin at the end of the month.
terrible. bank wont link and keeps failing, sending invoices and not getting paid as emails are not being received by clients i'm off to get invoice2go see how that goes i don't have this time for all this mess around
great app. very happy with the app so far. there is a couple thing that would be nice to be able to do from my i pad and not have to go to my computer hopefully in the next update they will.
. awefull, not suited to non accounting folk. unless you fully understand the system it will not represent the companies financial status.
handy app.. i've struggled for a while with record keeping and this app makes it very easy to keep records and do my day to day book keeping.
best app ever. thank you quickbooks making everything simple
can’t enter, view or edit bills. this app would be great, except you can’t enter or edit bills. workaround would be to login to website, but then what’s the point of having the app.. just use the website for full functionality
could be better. still no auto save. it’s 2018 folks, time to wake up. does not perform the same on my phonetablet as my desktop. i.e automated emails on my desktop autofill my clients name, my phone does not. on my desktop i can switch the order of items on my invoices and estimates, on my phone i cannot. the simple editing features are extremely important on a device that smaller than my hand.
. best app
hi. app don't work
handy. as long as i have internet connection i can create new customers, create invoices, and bill the job right at the job. i can input cash receipts and any bank charges that have cleared.
excellent. for someone who hates keeping receipts. this system is perfect, i simply photography my receipts, lose them as usual and still get to claim my expenses. no more awful receipts for me!!
superbly designed. having used two competitors' products before, i've been very pleasantly surprised with quickbooks. it's really easy to use but, at the same time, it has lots of really helpful features. the app is well designed but my only gripe is that i am sometimes unable to login. the problem usually corrects itself after a while, but it's a bit annoying when i need it at the time. nevertheless, the product is so good that this doesn't even bother me much.
they just keep changing the app.. my biggest complaint about the app is the limited features on customer entries. the pc version you can enter a customer as tax exempt on the phone you can't. further if you open the customer information on the phone and save it it will clear the tax exempt status on the pc version as well. so it is a constant battle to keep who is and isn't exempt straight.
. quick books and intuit do not support you or your business if you get scammed. warning do not use this app for credit card transactions. you get screwed. screwed me out of almost $500
. works well. user friendly.
. amazing app . makes my business bookkeeper free. defo recommend
. ☢️ testversion — 30tage  nur englisch 👎🏼 ☢️ deinstallliert ⚠️ edit: aber wozu eine app, wenn ich um die website nicht herumkomme ⁉️
great app. extremely easy to use and has made doing my accounts a much easier and enjoyable experience! would highly recommend!
love it. i send 5 to 10 bills per day and this app makes it easy, like the staples button.
great. it is a great way of keeping on top of my finances, invoicing and money owed. allows invoices to be raised on the go when small jobs are completed. can see how it will adapt as my business grows as well
. its a good app but they keep raising the monthly charge by more than 25% every 10 months... i'm now paying $35month. i will be looking for a new accounting software. they say it is for new improvements to the software, however, i was fine with the way it was. don't pass that on to existing customers who have been loyally using the software. i think it is a poor excuse. unacceptable.
"soooo slow. i have been using this app for about three years , and it was very functional and useful, but now, almost every time i open it, it says ""downloading data,"" and stays there... for 35 minutes doesnt matter whether my phone is on wifi or cell coverage. i hope they fix this bug."
owner small massage therapy business. for the small amount of paperwork my business requires, this app is perfect. i can input info before leaving the office and it prompts me with appropriate questions to categorize items properly. very user friendly and convenient.
. easy to setup & customize invoices, accurate, i am pleased!
. not useful in india at all
opens the closes. after the last update of quick books i can not access it on my ipad. there for it is costing me money. i hit the app it opens the closes right back. i have uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it is the same thing. i have 3 jobs i did today that i could not take payment on because of this. please fix asap
. i have not been able to log into the app. i keep receiving an error message indicating i need to install the latest version, but it is already installed. i even attempted uninstalling and reinstalling, to no avail.
essential sme tackle. intuit recently upped their game quite dramatically with the reworked online interface, which is extremely slick and intuitive (no pun!)... or at least as intuitive as double entry accounting software can be for the layman... if they added the ability to set different product pricing structures for different customers and a decent cash flow projection tool, i reckon i could justifiable give it five stars.
love this app. works great and i can navigate and make invoices and track everything in one app! i love it
. great app
this makes business owner life that much easier. i love this app, intuit is the best period. i also have mint app but this is easier for me as a business owner as weird as it may sound
experience getting worse. entering transaction requires way too many taps. it isn’t location aware to suggest transactions you just always search. recent updates have some bug that makes the app download the data file with almost every login and login often you must. usually twice a week it loses my password. i have enjoyed quickbooks online but this app experience may have me evaluating competitors in december.
. this is by far the worst app i have ever used words can not explane how usless this app really is do not i repeat do not wast your time with the garbage
after 3 years qb stops working. spent hours on the phone with support. no solution. cannot add items to an invoice. i'm a distributor so mobile is pretty important. sorry qb pretty disappointed with your product.
love this app. great app would recommend to everyone.
no option to add revenue into qb. there is not option, i have found, to integrate revenueincome related transactions into quickbooks. topnotch when it comes to documenting expenditures, but lacking when it comes to revenueincome
quickbooks app. i find this app to be the most useful app on my phone to run my yard care business due to be able to add jobs that have been done right on my phone to make it easier to remember what's been done
five star, defenitly!! :d. quickbook app is a great add to the software program. easy to use, fast and well organize!
app for small busines. fact, this app save me 11 hours a week in paper work period. great for small start up business
. love this app, keeps track of all my expenses and payments from clients. easiest way to do estimates and invoices as well.
still can't create po's through app. i use quickbooks for 2 things mainly. to create estimatesinvoices and send pos once the invoice has been paid. i can't create po's with the app so it's useless. i have to go to the website every time i want to create a po. it makes no sense that they would leave this feature out.
crashes, isn't sign in. stock nexus 5x. app won't sign in, hangs, now crashes every time.
. great app works and does what is needed to run your business away from you computer
. i use this app for my pest control business. it has some ups and downs but overall it's easy to use and a great product at a great price.
. this app really is useless. i'm having to manually input all of my banking transactions because it never feeds in the real time info as it should. the layout is counter intuitive and frustrating to use. it's like they've made the app but never done any testing or had any feedback on how they can improve it and make it user friendly. my books are an incoherent mess at the moment, this app is supposed to make things easier but it's awful.
easy to use. great on the go
. great app
suberb. really great app
an excellent tool for my onsite work!. for several years, i've used this app to instantly create invoices right at completion of the task. it never has let me down, and i walk out with payment!
. very handy!
too many errors to count. i’ve been using mint for years and love it. this software on the other hand is terrible. save yourself the frustration and use anything else.
so easy. this app makes it so easy to print invoices for my clients on the go! also cuts down on time that i have to sit at my desk at home and allows more time with family. great app.
custom invoices & estimates. this is a bad design
. easy to create an invoice, a little difficult to look a customer's information via the phone app.
small business. i have been using qb for two years now and i am very satisfied with what the program can do for me. i like the flexibility of being able to use it on my tablet, computer or my mobile phone.
. muito bom app!
frustrating. it's good to be able to use from iphone etc but i can't get any support or reply for help just doesn't happen seriously thinking of going back to reckon just because of this
. zero! the app says it needs to update, then brings me to a screen giving a choice of uninstall or open. if i choose open, i'm back to the need to update. if i uninstall and reinstall, that's just more steps before i'm back to the same useless place. garbage software. update: this was a problem they had seen and were working on. they fixed it and informed me of the fix a few hours later. working now.
mr. nice app
. i'm a small business and growing this app has been a god send
. error message when i try to log in on my tablet. customer service offers little assistance after a long time on hold. this experience makes accounting for my small business even more unbearable. (update 11418): i dropped the review down to one star (from 2) because the error message is yet to be resolved on my tablet, three months later, and qb has increased the cost of their simple start plan by 30%. lame.
does it work?. great app. keeps me well ordered and never lets me down
charge for an expense???. can't even include an expense on an invoice. rubbish !!!!
awesome. i'm a carpenter. this app changed my life, and actually gave me back a lot of my life. estimates done before you leave your customers house? how cool is that.
. app is pretty much useless. pointless to have an app when i have to enter my transactions on a desktop anyway. i want general journal entries in the app (or ya know, a better way to enter my daily sales info) or my damn money back!
easy. great app that is so simple to navigate, and dead easy for business novices. well designed.
good app. not 100% good.
great for tracking business and personal expenses. great app
. good app but could definitely use a few key features added to make it that much more usable for my type of business
. i just use the app for invoices while still out on the road. works a treat.
. installed. was so excited. doesnt connect to server. period. useless. rather use simple invoicing
awesome. great program
suits me. so easy to use, perfect for my tiny business. don't need accounting skills the workflow has been designed very well and support is great.
. adding time tracking to the app would be nice.
not accurate, crashes often. this app goes from being usable to worthless on a whim. it also does not show simple things like how many $ in open invoices, (right now it says we have $488 in total receivables, when we have way more). the desktop app is fine, the ios app needs a ton of work.
. awesome app
miss e hughes. fantastic resource easy to you & amazing customer service.
. app isn't working, its getting crashed everytime i try to login
touch id is pointless. needs work!. the new update was supposed to fix the touch id issue. you can log in via touch id. however if you kill the app or restart your phone, you need to log back in using your password. what is the point? i want to log in via touch id everytime. that's what it's there for.
app not working since update. normally i'd give the app 45 stars but every time i log in now it says sign in successful but there is no online account associated with the email and to start a free trial. however when i login from safari, i get in no problem. please fix as i am unable to access data from my phone.
pretty useless. very slow and painful to use, doesn’t let you bank any payments etc. probably only useful for those who wish to produce very basic invoices
great app!. great app for small medium enterprises
a good portable quickbooks app. the app has most of the important features, is easy to use, and is certainly a better option than trying to use the quickbooks online on an iphone. it is not a complete substitute as there are several features not available on the app,but it does allow recording time and expenses while on the road and even allows checking on and updating bank balances.
iphone app is the worst. the iphone app doesn't work. their customer service people admitted it doesn't work. don't even try to use it  too frustrating and a big waste of time. online version and ipad versions are good but too limited for price  reports can't compare year over year
love it!. quickbooks has changed the way we invoice and track expenses. the ability to provide estimates then convert to invoices is amazing. the mobile app allows me to work on the go.
disappointed. just updated to the latest version and this app is crashing all day i can’t even use it normally i need to log on 10 times to write one customer i can’t run my business normally like this please fix asap the app tells me you need to do critical updates. idiot i juts updated the app and now it crashes ever time i open it
. i'm trying to reset my password from past 1 week but can't as i'm unable to access my registered phone. i have access to email address but still it's asking for otp sent to phone number. bad customer service.... their is no option to contact customer service no phone number no email. my companies while accounts is their.
. i've got self employed subscription but app doesn't recognise it
useless. why even bother with this app? i can enter a bill from a sub or supplier on the website or the mac app but can only enter paid expenses here? i can do everything i need to do with my business on my iphone without carrying an ipad or macbook air except use the quickbooks app to enter or actually pay bills (only able to record bills already entered as paid). please fix this (or just tell us you’re not fixing it) !!!
. excellent easy to use, logical app. saves me loads of time
great software for small business.. only complaint is that i'm always greeted by a pop up, asking me to rate the app, which i grow weary of, so here i am.
does not work. quickbooks will not let me access via my mobile device, neither through my browser or through this app. figure it out guys, smart phones are the most common computers people use these days...
awesome. it saves me so much time. great to keep up with my business accounting. mostly simple to use. some features require a bit of basic accounting knowledge.
. entered in info 2 link bank business card. then i went & made a purchase with that same card & nothing showed up. giving apps a shot, even though i know in the back of my mind that anything can be hacked. i'm not trying this again will uninstall.
excellent product. great for sending estimates and invoices on the go. everything i need to see right at my fingertips and very user friendly.
great app. user friendly. simple and intuitive!
. no major issues with the app. handy when scanning receipts.
nice app. good to run the business with this app
. worst billing app i ever had.. they give false promises before subscribtion. once the customer transfered money. no body will respond for our problems
tide business bank not supported :(. i'm rating this 1 star due to there being no support for setting a business account created via tide
changed the way we do business. i love this app. we needed something that we could easily use in the field. we can create estimates, invoices, receive payments and even attach check images to those payments. our productivity has skyrocketed. quickbooks has figured out the mobile accounting software. customers for life.
unwanted changes. we pay for the service, yet intuit dictates changes to our invoices that have doubled our paper use as well as anger our customers. you make the changes without any notice or options to do otherwise. nasty, mean dictatorial behavior!
works well. it crashes and freezes every now and then which is annoying but it usually works very well. it's a very helpful app for my business
happy but need a little help on a question. i like the app. i can’t seem to get the job address or shipping address to show up on the invoice... it s a big concern for me.
does not update. i post payments and the sustem still shows full amount due. also will not log in from phone after dozen attempts and entering codes from qb
newest update is nothing but problems. can no longer update estimates. freezes and have to close app. also cannot see new estimates fellow employees have created. app ran perfectly prior to the update. intuit needs to launch new update asap or they are losing my business.
update to the update.. they fixed the update. i updated my rating.
not working properly after update. i just updated the app and now every time i try to edit an invoice it forces me to refresh the invoice and i lose my changes. the pin number does't work, i added it again and made sure it is turned on, but i have to sign in with my username and password each time. it worked perfectly on the last update.
touch id fixed!. touch id stopped working with previous update. they've addressed it now. looks good!
sweet. app is so easy and convenient! greatest thing about it is that it synchronizes with square so i don't have to worry about writing anything down anymore again. the snap is such a great convenience!
excellent app. ease the booking... awesome
. the app has stopped working. wont sync my data. very angry as i have customers who need their bills
excellent software. but need to make as industrial requirements. we have travel agency but it restricts us in many places. if ad travel agency options will be better.
. excellent app
online quick books rocks!. they do a great job with this application. amazing how you can create invoices on the road and take deposits from your phone!
a handy little companion but it wont replace the website. a number of features from the web portal are missing such as matching bank transactions but its ok to use simply to check your chart of accounts and to record expenses.
. after updated the app to the latest version, this app can no longer be used as it keeps forced closing.
great app. just need a bit more of the functionality of the full site. like the time activity bit. account balance updating would be good to.
. very convenient to use especially when entering expenses! no lost receipts.
problem with update please fix. iphone x, after updating the app, it doesn’t let me edit any transactions at all, i can only approve what is recognized transaction, an unrecognized transaction is not responsive to touchscreen commands so i have to cancel edit. please fix
. edit from original post... qb quickly resolved the issues and this app is great again!  this used to be a great app, i have used it for 4 years but unfortunately it is no longer working... i can no longer login, i keep getting an error saying it can't sync. i hope this gets fixed soon, i run 90% of my business from my phone and having a working phone app is part of the fee we pay for qb online.
great app. it is what it is. it an app. it won't have all the features of a computer and you should not expect it to. does exactly what i need it to in the field.
okay. i'm new to doing my own bookkeeping and find this product clunky and not very easy to use. issues with importing transactions and program changing dates and the order compared to the bank. it's not very easy to see what account transfers are moving tofrom. it's hard to distinguish credits for debits. poor customer service. no good summary graphs. slow to attach receipts. multiple clicks to do basic things. cuts off file names if there too long.
. very cool for our business great app helps put us a step ahead of the competition and print an estimate on the spot from our truck selling the job automatically.
. easy and user friendly app
update ruined a great small business tool. quickbooks use to be an awesome tool to let us send invoices after a job is completed on the spot. it also allowed a user to edit payment information anywhere via the mobile app. this is now all gone thanks to the new update. if it is not fixed soon, we are looking into transferring our accounts to another system.
former intuit betatester. i love this program and like to see how far intuit has come these past few years...you may think i am biased, however, i use the program and love it...keep up the good work all. addendum: it is my pleasure to help with a program that i helped to take from a boxed prgm to a widely used online tool. you are most welcome. i will try to help and make suggestions as necessary.
great software. great software just the when printing description in my home language it gives squares
good but.... very useful, but needs flexibility for budgeting and more reports. i do most of my work on my ipad so it falls short of desktop online version.
. great app!
not bad, not amazing. it's quick books. the app gives you access to some information, but not everything.
. this software has been critical in keeping track of invoices.
qbo. very helpful with creating invoices.
. great app. i manage my painting company from here ...
heatingcooling guy. trying to use the app. nothing is happening, app opens and it’s blank this morning. preformed an update too, still nothing. garbage app, sorry.
great app. being able to use quickbooks on my phone has really helped my business run more efficiently. i'm able to manage customers and employees all from my phone.
. this is a good app for my electrical business
i like it. i still like it. i don't know all of what has changed yet but i think it is easier for me to get around that before.
superb!!!. this is a great app for keeping up to date with accounts. links to my bank accounts and intelligently matches transactions and remembers previous matches and entries. certainly deserves the name quickbooks based on how quickly i can enter my bank transactions. great for multiuser access and very easy to set up. overall this is much better than i expected.
crashing in ios 13. crashing in ios13 can’t even open the app .. having trouble managing my business
nice app. great for basic entry and review. wichita had a bit more functionality like the normal interface. still a great app when out meeting clients and needed to create  view  send account info in the field.
. switch to xero even though its more expensive. better off wasting money on a useless app. cant even save a transaction. lousy support and engineering team to not resolve such a essential feauture after 1 month. subscribe at your own risk.
. when it works it works great. however i have to periodically delete and reinstall the app because it gets buggy entering new expenses. it will get locked in the expense screen. in the locked screen if i hit save 5 times it will record the transaction 5 times while still sitting in the entry screen. **update the developer solution did not work.
. not worth the cost but it does track expenses.
reduced feature set. need to have timesheet function put into app! please!! also, the separation of vendor mtce from vendor transactions is opposite of the web interface. same for customers.
i use it with all my clients!. having a business solutions & consulting biz for years there have been times i've lost notes or even lost billable time. having the ease of this program not only resolves that, but it also runs easily in multiple platforms including my preferred operating system utilizing a linux distribution.
awesome app. quick books is really an awesome app. links up to accounts quickbooks payments. i can access from all my devices. it’s really versatile. you can make great estimates as well. emailed invoices and estimates look very professional.
if you’re serious about your business.... if you’re serious about being a business person in the modern era, get familiar with quickbooks and other intuit products. well worth the subscription.
user friendly!. makes my life so much easier. i'm able to create and send off the things i need while with a client in the field.
stable. no longer crashes. the first update into ios 10.0.2 was really bad. wouldn't load. this update fixes that issue and i'm back working. was a setback for a week as i do a lot of invoice updates through the app, but i made due.
indispensable. as a mobile tutor, and entrepreneur  recent business owner, this app more than pays for itself in the value it brings. i'm always on the go it seems, and my business comes with. makes accounting, etc a breeze!!!
. omg invoices still not updating. i have recorded payments and online show paid. this app shows them past due since august. app sucks
. very easy to use, takes little effort to keep track of all your sales and spending. i do wish it had a spot to put miles withought buying the mile version though.
. intuit sucks! scamming company ran by non english speaking reps. bought simple start 2007 for 125.00 with online access ,etc. in 2010 they ended all support for this software. that is shady. they promise you all these free services and then years later a foreigner informs you that all support has ended. to better serve there newer products. they suck.
good app. very useful app when on the go.
hopeless. ever since my accountant asked to use it, the app is never able to retrieve any data keeps giving a message to say ‘unable to retrieve data’. what’s the point of the app if i can’t see the dashboard and data when i need to?
thanks intuit. i can create invoices at the job and get paid on the spot. ..no problems so far.
. great app and easy to use
very satisfied!. been using the mobile app for the past 3 months now, and i can say it does everything i need. very easy to issue invoices, receive the money, match, reconcile the bank. the support people are very helpful and have a lot of patience!
good if it's working. tedious authorization every time you have to reconnect with your bank. the desk top app isn't quicker and it seems to crash at the most crucial time!
it's really useful. it's really useful
love the app, but price is too high. i love the app, but when will the price increases stop. as soon as i have time to research other programs i will cancel my subscription. $40 per month is too much to just invoice customers and reconcile my bank statement.
amazing app. i'm a pro advisor and i love qbo and it's app. if you need help working this application or quickbooks let me know. joeaguilar04@gmail.com
scam!. this app won’t let you unsubscribe. forgot my password and tried all ways to access my account, but they won’t send me a verification code in my phone. i have exhausted all efforts to change my password and log in, but to no success. i reached out to their failure of a customer service representative, didn’t help either! scam!
where the banking. i want to accept transactions while i sit in bed, this app is far from useful without that capability, come on intuit, make the app complete. as is, a total let down!
please: give us delayed charge already!. a new update, and still no delayed charge feature. how many times do we have to ask? for the love of gawd, why can i not add a delayed charge on the mobile app?????? this is something you actually want to do when you're at a client, not get them to sign for an invoice every time you visit them during the month.
great. great app really comes in handy when i'm away from my office.
this is useless for invoicing. useless: on the product list it only shows first two words and the ..... i have multiple variations in same item. i can’t search product with sku, when i search by name it only shows first two words and then dots. i cant add the exact product on invoice. so its useless.
. been using this app for almost a full year was working great, now get error and will not sync data. if it does not get fixed will be forced to move to different accounting solution update; tried your solutions and emailed the error to support multiple times no response. i created another trial account and that one retrieved data no issue. it just wont retrieve data on mobile from my actual company account.
. i have called customer support twice now. each time, i am greeted by an overly friendly person who barely speaks a word of english. either time was the agent able to even understand what i am asking for. they could offer no help, they would not transfer me to someone else. i am left all alone here trying to navigate a program and run a business. i have no idea how to get any help from these people. thank goodness for youtube!
. clunky, ugly app with barely any features. there's no way to refresh your banking data within the app, though navigation and ux is so awful i maybe just can't find it. no consistent design standard throughout with multiple different menu types, navigation styles, presentation. almost no graphics, just pages of text. invoicing, expenses and tracking are all so horrible i'm forced to use the (also underwhelming) browser version. how did this pass quality control?
one thing. i give it four stars cause i cant figure out how to keep it completely updated and current, i have qb on my computer and i have information on there that does not show up on the app, but overall its perfect.
ok app. easy to setup. big difference between windows version and ipad version. like the amount of critical info showed. on the windows version all critical info is shown. on the iso device not enough info shown. like cash sale,
brilliant but.... ... i’d like to be able to schedule invoices to be sent out on later dates and set up automatic recurring invoices as i supply weekly subscribed services to my clients.
best app ever. thank you quickbooks making everything simple
good but. it would be great if you could take a photo of a receipt instead of having to scan and save to a location on the phone
mostly great!. at the moment qb's mobile won't work. some kind of trouble with company data downloading. hopefully fixed soon.. otherwise good and handy app.
. best app for keeping up with your expenses
please add a “transfer” option on app. overall good app but would like to have a transfer option on the mobile app i find myself having to login to the desktop version just to transfer amounts between my accounts. also, someone please find a way to mark estimates as “readseen” by the customer just like the invoices do. ipad version needs help; jumps around too much
one of the worst decisions ever!. i decided to move forward with quick books because of a friend recommending it to me. this has been one of the worst experiences ever. the customer service is terrible and the fact that quick books owes me money is even worst. i highly recommend that no one uses this service.
. best accounting app (online software) by far
great app!. our company switched from quickbooks desktop to the online version which came with the option to download the app. we now use the app more than online. we handle estimates, invoices, payments, banking and more directly in the app and on the go. the app has a simple and clean look making it easy to navigate. to date we haven't had any issues with it. we are excited to finally be able to get things done in less time!
just fine for a small business. if you are looking to get up and running quickly, then this will do just fine. the subscription is a little on the high side compared to sage's offering, but sage is a lot more difficult to use.
so glitchy!! 😡. quickbooks has the potential to be great. but this app is so, so glitchy! have constant problems with it and i'm really getting to the point of giving up and going back to sage. every time a problem is sorted, a new one pops straight back up. if they could employ some decent tech guys and get things working properly, this would be brilliant.
awesome. this app is awesome quick efficient and mobile please consider for small business accounting needs
. use this app all the time, bc of that it a time saver!
please add delayed charges. i like this app, but i mostly do my bookkeeping at my desktop. delayed charges are something i would like to add on the fly, using mobile. please add!!
great app. i love working with quickbooks i can take it with me anywhere i go and makes everything with my business that much easier. i have used other apps that were good but they didn't tie everything together like quickbooks. i highly recommend it.
great app but missing some key functions. i've used qb online for a year now and its a great service. the app allows me to invoice and record pymts immediately, however i cant seem to enter expenses. if i could do that it would get 5 stars.
. not sure why i pay $16 a month for this app when it only works 60% of the time. please get the bugs worked out or i will have find another company to run my business with. cant access my account on tablet, cant save invoice or estimate on s8. please fix.
quickbooks online app. although i do like quickbooks online, the mobile app version is horrible. i downloaded and logged in and it did give me my balance sheet, but said i had no expenses, i could not find a way to put in a journal entry and other reports showed zeros as well. i deleted it from my ipad and will just use the nonapp version ( which you need google chrome vs safari to work properly not a big deal but a bit odd).
app needs help. great desktop program. the app needs to be able to track mileage and time on a job. that's really my only complaint the more i use it the more i like it
business handled from my phone. works well, update is even better. can create invoices, print, email, track and reconcile business spending. shows if invoices have been sent ( when emailing) as well as read. would give 5 stars if i were able to record bank deposits with this app. currently customer payments remain in undeposited funds until i log in to the desktop site. also wish i could save time by printing batch invoices. overall very useful, easy way to handle business on the go.
. there is a error when trying to add item, i have sent message to support with no reply, as well as requested input from the community. i guess you can't ask for much help with such small fees per month.
good unless u need their help. i had a problem as accidentally created 2 companies in the one profile. subscription applied to wrong company and they had no idea how to fix it. the company with all my accounting was cancelled as ‘trial ended’ but other company with no data was fully subscribed. very frustrating when dealing with idiots in the phone!
doesn’t work. i have an iphone 8 and all of a sudden this app stops working. i call quickbooks and they can’t fix it. they closed the case in one day. don’t walk away from this company, run away.
learning curve and then it's awesome.. takes some getting used to but i've now got it and it's actually very useful and easy to use. integration between my pc and iphone make it easy on the go and sitting at home. estimates, invoices & expenses all in one app.
statement from app ?. works great for me but i wish you were able to print off a statement from the app. with all the updates lately. why is it so hard to be able to create a statement from the app? not the biggest deal in the world but very inconvenient.
terrible app. quickbooks is a terrible app on my iphone & my ipad. it's not even a good program on my computer. it's extremely limited & each update does nothing to improve it. if there was another accounting system i could use, i would.
owner. love the program i am having problems inputing my desktop customers and previous business information. called the help desk and still waiting forba fix
. already pay for online subscription qb pro why do u charge for the mobile companion. rip off. software is already expensive. american greed!!!!
literally crashes every time i try to enter a sale.. great for tracking expenses but useless for processing and tracking sales. very disappointed.
great app. i love this app!!!
latest update issue. the latest update does not allow you to create a sales receipt, estimate, invoice, etc., from the customer, you need to go to the home screen to work around it. this is better than the last time this happened (within the last several months) at which point there was no work around. at least we can process cards for now...
. very easy to use software, professional looking documents issued and logical methodnof keeping books.
great tool. its great tool for small business. makes my life easier. recommend
great app. need this so bad
very convenient. it keeps program updated and very handy to access on all platforms
hot garbage. latest update to this piece of garbage app requires you to log in every single time. pathetic these guys can’t get it right.
why so many permissions. this is a great app but it does not need to access my photos not my conacts, etc. as it is our privacy is getting invaded i don't want other apps to access anything more than what it should.
keep logging me out. after the update the application keeps logging me out every single time please fix that, used to do it with the previous update before this last one, you guys fixed it, but with this new update is doing it again
. unfriendly interface need to load inventory data on invoice costs profits etc no facility
. great app. now if they could only add payroll...
great app.. i am new to quickbook, but found this app as very helpful tool to run a small business, no matter where i am, at home, in the office or on the road. thanks +++++
complete waste of time.. 100% completely useless and a total embarrassment. in the year 2013 quickbooks is the only company left that cannot figure out how to make their full product work on an ipad. please fire your entire tech department and hire a high school kid with skills.
. this software is superb for business owners but need some customization in product and services option they should provide stock quantities in app and also purchase invoice with itemised discounts option should provided in app
. no problems. real time bookkeeping
please stop making my sign in. every other fingerprint authentication app on my phone (banking, password manager, file managers) does not nag me to log in via password every other day. why does this app do so? please fix.
crashing after ios 13 update. after ios 13. i can not log into my quickbooks app please fix this asap
. so far i haven't enjoyed this app. you can't scan a receipt with details auto uploading but you can on the selfemployed version and also had no luck at uploading a file into an expense when manually loading details from a receipt.
easy to use. really happy with quickbooks in general.
. was working for a couple months. now i can longer link to my bank account and the app constantly freezes with either a blank screen or white screen. completely useless..
dirty tactics for subscription. unsubscribing to this app is so difficult. an error prompt always appears everytime i process unsubscribing. but if it’s any form of purchase, upgrading, downgrading, anything other than unsubscribing works just fine. no reply from their customer service since i contacted them a few weeks ago. i hope other people who has the same problems with this app comes forward so this developer stops milking money from unwilling customers.
online quick books. great app but way too expensive! $15 per month is a bit on the high side.
if it wasn’t broken, it would be much better.. when i launch this app on any of my devices, i get an error in the app that says “unable to get all of your quickbooks data pull down to refresh your page.”
new to quickbooks. i decided to switch my established business from square to quickbooks and so far i have no complaints. it’s fairly easy to use. the only thing i’m currently waiting on is for my transactions to clear and be deposited which takes about a week since i’m new. should be a breeze after that.
. update sucks
mgrm. great app. useful and easy to use.
so far so good. i’ve only been using a short time, but i like the speed and usability, more than on the desktop app.
almost perfect. please add the ability to print or download packing slips from the mobile app. everything else can wait till i am back in the office. sometimes a packing slip must be done in a rush. mobile app is useless to me without the packing slip feature.
great job. great app! great for my graphic design business!
error. a lot of error messages when trying to save things. only to find out it was saved twice afterwards.
. great app
great for small business. it's a great app for small business. since it's a cloud solution, cheap and easy to access your finances from any where. need improvement to have detailed views and reporting for the management.
needs work. this won't stay up to date with online or desktop app and i regularly get error messages. this is frustrating and useless.
best app ever!. i run my whole totally green business from my 📱all because of this app. it makes business seem so easy!
so messy and confusing.. iphone app is so messy and confusing. desktop version struggles so much to gather my company info, and there really isn't much. errors out all the time.
. the app is great when it works! it took 3 times of deleting and reinstalling to get it to work again. but its working perfctly again.
new update crashes every time. new update makes me close and reopen every time for critical app updates
love it. easy to use and reliable. customer love the fact that they can sign the estimate and invoice.
error. the app is not letting me sign in! it keeps saying error!
. thanks for the quick reply, awesome app.
great app for small business!. i love being able to enter my expenses and invoices from my phone. very convenient and makes tax time much easier!
love itrepeat user. i love quickbooks because of the ease of getting things done in accounting. i am by no means an accountant but this does everything for me and i just hand it to my accountant at the end of the year which makes it so easy.
amazing for small business!!!!!!. i started my service business one year ago and enrolled in quickbooks from day one. i can't rave enough about it! it's made tracking customers, invoices, and expenses so easy i can focus on my work instead of the accounting. still impressed and just in the process of adding payroll.
. good app for a start up business and it will grow with your business.
still doesn't work. touch id is still not working. must manually log in to the app each time i use it throughout the day. this is super annoying not to mention time consuming. and time is money!
. great software for small businesses.
saves so much time. i got this app to help save time and it does. it took awhile to set up and i have had to phone for help a few times and they have been fab. i can send invoices and receipts form my phone. i am able to keep up to date on my accounts without the effort.
great app. works great
typical intuit product. buggy, not awesome user experience. slow, lots of errors, doesn't work most of the time and no support. use freshbooks or something else if you care about running a business.
. not very user friendly. can't enter data easily. the point to download the app was to have an easy access to my account when i am out working or if i have walkups. i will be able to easily send out an invoice or charge a credit card.
. love the app
. i do everything from my phone or tablet. this makes things so much easier
amazing app!. very good app! helps you learn a lot about coding!
. love this program
good for small business. i have a hvac & plumbing company and this helps keep everything in order. just wish there was a way to offer options on the estimates to my customers so they could pick which things they want to have done.
great app. easy to use very helpful!!!!!
. app crashes all the time
cannot find anything useful in the app. how do i display a report of unpaid bills? far too limited to be of any use.
everything i need. the quickbooks app has met every one of my needs for my small handyman business. i love the ability to email customers estimates, invoices, and sales receipts while i am standing there with them. i have only been using the app for a little over a month but i feel good about my decision to go with quickbooks online.
not helpful. this app doesn't help me. i get errors every time i try to match or categorize a transaction from my bank. it's useless for me.
amazing, powerfull and simple. switched from sageone and wow, for the same price i get a much better mobile app, that actually do more, and is very simple to use. and the last update made it even better with the overall view.
new update crashes every time. new update makes me close and reopen every time for critical app updates
. so far total garbage app. i connected my app to my qb online account. i opened the app. snapped 3 receipts. camera worked well isolating the receipts. after that totally useless. despite a new tab appearing in my banking section online i cannot find the receipt copies in either the app or online. i really needed one to return a product. qb cs of no help.
excellent app for my business. works wonderfully!
. good app for startup
new business. great app, easy to use when building my own business.
. i have not been able to sign in to the app on my phone for a few months now. when i select ny company file, it has to think about it for a few minutes then i get a message saying an error has occurred and to try again later. i then can send this to intuit, which i do, but have never once heard back as to what the errorissue is that is not allowing me to sign in.
. i would have given four stars except the tab function in the app has not worked in a few months.
easy plain and simple. simple to use but a bit plain on the app web version is great well done this enables business owners who are not accountants to watch and manage there business with ease i now only pay a accountant to check over at the end instead of paying them £250+ per month !
best quickbooks i have used.. this app does everything for your business it's quick it's easy and fast so i recommend this to anybody
don grant mechanical services. commercial. residental ,heating airconditioning , refrigeration, makeup air systems, light plumbing, and electrical
. loved it, but acting up again. when i add something to an invoice (on s8) the hit done, the refreshed invoice lines are all out of order and duplicated. uninstalled and reinstalled, still doing it. please fix.
happy customer. i love this app.can do my invoices everywhere on my mobile or tablet.
great app!!. use this daily with my lawn carelandscape business. the only addition i would like to see is the ability to enter delayed charges. as we service each lawn, it would be huge to be able to input the charge for the work rather than do everything at the end of the day. otherwise, no issues at all.
poor compatibility. online version does not work with safari. quickbooks refused a refund stating it is not there issue. avoid and just get a good account
great support but app is flawed. i have several companies setup on one login. this was done by qb themselves but it keeps crashing, stalling or telling me there is a fault. also don't choose 'other' as business type as list of income and expenditure categories is massively reduced and you will have to add the ones you want manually. customer service is excellent but i shouldn't need to know this!
. missing cpl of features like cheque writing, arap reports in mobile app.
quickly. quickbooks online is ready to use. i write invoices and email the customer a copy immediately. thanks quickbooks for being so easy to use.
. when editing an invoice, it doesn't let you scroll up to see the whole written document when your keyboard is open. galaxy s6. great other than that.
. im not a big on technology but i love this app.
problems. the app have now problems i recommend to check that i was using the app for 3 years but now is a disaster
. easy to use. very convenient great app
poor. if you write a review and the nickname is taken you have to start all over again. app is very limited and web version has problems with ipad pro
great app. fantastic app. does everything i need to run my business on the go.
. since they changed the app its not working properly nothing appears on the dashboard and can't produce invoices
don’t buy on apple!. if you subscribe through apple and then want to migrate to your business account, your data can’t be kept. you have to create a new company and re enter all your data!
where are the invoices??. what is the point of an accounting app that does not show supplier invoices? dreadful. support was as helpful as a chocolate teapot too ...
great app and super easy to use. very easy to use and customise. very intuitive to use and no excuse not to update on the go
quickbooks online app. very simple use, efficient and stable. i have no complaints!
. signed up 6 days ago for self employed package, although it says in the package i can use the app, when opening the app it states i have not signed up for it... emailed asking for help, no reply. scheduled a call back for tuesday 13pm, noone called. poor customer service. i will cancel and find another accountancy program.
. clunky, ugly app with barely any features. there's no way to refresh your banking data within the app, though navigation and ux is so awful i maybe just can't find it. no consistent design standard throughout with multiple different menu types, navigation styles, presentation. almost no graphics, just pages of text. invoicing, expenses and tracking are all so horrible i'm forced to use the (also underwhelming) browser version. edit: the developers comment below doesn't work as of 130619
great app. i compared couple of similar products and quickbooks was defiantly the best. i still believe that they could enhance their app to have identical features of their web version.
. very useful app that almost makes bookkeeping fun. almost... :) let's face it, bookkeeping is a dreary chore but this software makes it tolerable and even pleasant some days. good work quickbooks!
. luv how easy and convenient thus app is!
"great app. needs to have a switch company button.. i'm an accountant and this app is great. i can use it on any idevice and it updates everywhere. i'll give it 5 stars bc of its simplicity to use, however, the only gripe i have is that it should have a ""switch company"" button or have a different app for accountants with multiple clients such as myself. please setup the ""switch company"" button soon!"
president. this is a great app to use wherever you are. it actually works better on my ipad better than my computer in my office. i completely recommend this app and quick books for any small business owner. love it!!!
lacking features on the app. the online version is good and it has a lot of features. i hope to see them available on the app as well soon.
easy. easy to use, and has all the features i need to run my lawn care business. i recommend it to everyone. my only issue was getting my subscription paid for. i worked it out by calling customer service and they were awesome.
good app. goop app
efficient. makes my life a lot easier i can create invoices. customers can pay their bill right in front of me what i sent them to the email. can’t get no better than that
. great accounting software
much better than the desk top version. i really like this app as opposed to the old desktop version. i'm sure there are updates that could make it better, but i'm satisfied with how it works for me.
. great app very user friendly
lifesaver. i love this app, it saves me so much time on the road and so much paperwork later.
purchase orders. i've requested this over and over with no response. the inability to create a purchase order via a mobile device is very, very inconvenient.
works perfectly for me.. very convenient to have this program online. can run my business from my phone.
can't even open an account!. i live in spain and the app won't accept my mobile number. i even tried a uk number but even that doesn't work. thumbs down for not even letting international customers to use or even view the product.
essllc. works great, always performs as i need it too, makes invoicing and estimating a lot faster and easier! thank you qb
fix finally now i can get back to work.. this version fixed the errors from the last update. glad it working again. quickbooks has been good except the last update. this one fixed the issue. we us this app for our onsite business and it's great. several times i would send an invoice to the customer when i'm leaving their home and before i get to the next job it's already paid. update. does not work again. :(
great, easy to use quickbooks app. so many great features with this app, love it. so easy to use!
. this app has made my life much easier while handling my business accounts!
"buggy, issues with sync. for some reason this app is constantly having connection issues for me. i get messages like ""transaction not accepted"". then i have to log into the desktop version to actually do the work. ok for a glance but not useful for productivity."
quickbooks. this app is excellent and the version on my computer is even better save's me hours when quoting well worth the money.
works well but sometime updates break it so update with caution.. about every 6th update seems to have an error. overall its great.
we are using this with the construction side of our business and so far the customer service has been wonderful. there are things missing or not working but customer service had said they are working on getting them added or fixed. makes it really easy for our employees in the field to create invoices and send them to clients as well as receive payments. will change to five stars when missing components are added.
great app. so easy to use.
ok software. constant downloading of data and password reauthentication really slows down work. larger your business the longer it takes. you’d think with sas, would be much better. looking for opportunity to jump off.
. very logical and functional software,.
mgrm. great app
. i thought it was bad three years ago! its much worse now. not user friendly and still doesnt support my form of business. all they really do with this app is track your bank account and catigorise things. you can only catigorise as an expense or income. its the new year and new month and its counting transaction from jan 2019 as transactions from december 2018. i need help. any recomendations on business softwesr that also has tax softwear?
owner. 365 bookkeeping & payroll. absolutely love the qboa and the qbo mobile app. user friendly.
. sucks keeps saying i have update available but then everytime i try to download the upgrade i get error code 927 saying unable to complete download. with current app it doesn't allow me to look up past invoices. the things i use most are not on mobile app. all i do with it is print current invoices with my wireless eprinter and find customer contact numbers to call them. needs upgrading with more features.
. great software
just barely ok.. app has multiple issues . with page format. browser must use google chrome to get all options . called 3 times , on phone over hour each time . weeks later still nothing fixed . app is very limited .. customer service is a joke . here i thought i was upgrading to a better software . lol i was so wrong ..
. the app crashes half the time i try to use it.
still needs delayed charges. if you can add delayed charges to the available transactions, it will be perfect.
convenient mobile dashboard. very convenient mobile dashboard allows quick status of all my invoices.
. app is so slow and doesn't have the functionality of the full web version making it pretty useless
so happy. awesome app
glitches. app has lots of glitches. try to create an invoice and it was not working. quickbooks has been awesome up to this point. i run my whole business through quickbooks in this new update has been a disappointment. should've left it alone!
very good app. easy to use. recommended!
not very good. this app dose not work with samsung galaxy s 6 or 6 edged, iv phone over 6 time now and just keep getting fobbed off , i don't even think thinking quickbooks technical support know wat they are doing i'm just left in the dark
. recently purchased quickbooks and have been locked out. no reply from the qb team. inspite of sending mails and calling their representatives. thanks to qb; it sucks
limited. desktop app for mac is brutal slow. mobile apps ok but limited graphic reports
balance sheet. seem like they can’t fix having proper information on the chart of acct balances. it sends an error when you click on an acct. other than that the app is convenient
smooth app. love it and would never switch.
great way to keep track of business nunber on the go.. although it's not as good as the pc version it allows you to keep track of expenses as you make them while your away from the business.
useless. unless i am missing something i find this app absolutely useless. it does not show all of my accounts, so i can't see the account balances. supplier balances also don't show, if i need to play a supplier. it still needs a lot of work, so i will stick with using my macbook until then. it's actually not even worth using.
amazing!!!. i love the fact that i can take a pic of a source document, it it will convert it into pdf file and attach it to the transaction! and i can do pretty much everything in bookkeeping from my iphone!
. switch to xero even though its more expensive. better off wasting money on a useless app. cant even save a transaction. lousy support and engineering team to not resolve such a essential feauture after 1 month. subscribe at your own risk.
quickbooks online mobile. this app is very good and getting better. soon it will be as good as desktop version. thanks quickbooks team.
owner. useful for small business. able to use mobile app and coordinate with online.
broke!. worked perfect but for some reason it doesn't at at all anymore. crashes at login. i have deleted and reinstalled same issue. this is costing me time and money. really stinks.
. good app
time tracker missing. the online version is friendlier then the online desktop version, but all in all a great app. one thing missing is the time tracker. would be great to be able to track your time spend on a project and book it to an invoice.
. great app. saves time and simplifies billing customers on the go.
deposit. tried many times with support how to do deposit with app no one can tell me how using tablet very frustrating
statement from app ?. works great for me but i wish you were able to print off a statement from the app.
so easy to use!. love how simple and easy this is to use, love how it all connects to my paypal account too
. this app is simple and really easy to use. makes my job way easier.
best app ever. love quickbooks online.... easiest way to keep all my accounts and expenses in order.
little disappointed. qb on the cloud is a great idea and that's why i'm using it. however  wouldn't it be nice if the mobile version dis half what the desktop version does. i use mint for my personal finances and for a free service their app does it all. qb please get some programmers to get this app fully functional! i understand that you may not include every function but expenses??? that's something i expected to be able to do on the road.
happy but need a little help on a question. i like the app. i can’t seem to get the job address or shipping address to show up on the invoice... it s a big concern for me.
cannot edit suppliers at all with the ipad app. i think the title says it all. i started an invoice from a supplier, however i cannot continue it on the ipad. it is just impossible! it just cannot be done. so it is for that reason only i am giving it one star. on the computer it is great, the ipad app is useless.
. in general this is a good accounting app but lacks some of the features of the desktop site. the automatic email from the app and the desktop site is also more like its promoting qb than my organisation. new projectclient costing is very good so far.
roofing business. i have been using quickbooks for almost a year for my husband roofing business and i love it! why we are out looking at jobs i can do an invoice on my phone and email it right away to the customer! and i can go home and work from laptop as well! i recommend quickbooks for book keeping for business!
. great on the go invoice app
. this programapp has paralyzed me from carrying out business transactions and estimations due to a failure in the app being able to sync my data for 3 days now, customer support is next to nothing when day after day they told me i will receive an email once the issue is resolved. i am losing money and this does not seem to be a priority for quickbooks.
. my experience with qb has been great. its fast easy to operate .
no timesheets. i wish it had employee information access. would love to be able to track hours from the app!!!
"buggy, rough, glitchy. frequently disconnectswon't sync to my companies data. frequently ""has trouble emailing this form"" when i try to send clients invoices. frequently is unable to save invoices. using 4g lte network and wifi with same results. says i'm offline when connected to wifi and network. only way to solve problems is seemingly to uninstall and reinstall app. update: now app frequently won't create pdf's that i can then print out. absolutely horrible for mobile business convenience."
disaster to sign out. i happened to see this app and found it is interesting to scan invoices but turns to be that i have to be a “company” to use it and have to pay so much for it! so expensive!!!!!!
great app!. our company switched from quickbooks desktop to the online version which came with the option to download the app. we now use the app more than online. we handle estimates, invoices, payments, banking and more directly in the app and on the go. the app has a simple and clean look making it easy to navigate. to date we haven't had any issues with it. we are excited to finally be able to get things done in less time!
wht and whvat accounting. great software, but requires improvement to include withholding tax accounting
might be better. purchases within the app are very expensive! and, by the way, the app cannot be considered as stable
great app for qb online. when i need an invoice sent out and i'm away from my pc, qb solved the inconvenience with this app. one thing i can't find is how to change the figure slide login.
slow books. i am constantly waiting in front of my customers for qb to load
quickbooks. quickbooks on my cell phone keeps me in touch with our office 247. once data is entered by our staff it is immediately updated to my cell phone as well as other devices. for the times our staff had a question regarding entries, the help line for quickbooks was always answered by a person who took a personal interest in our problems and they always found a solution. dorothy apartment rentals
. the app keeps me up to date because i can work anywhere with my phone
ran into unsupported transactions within 1 minute.. the app is difficult to navigate, bloated and slow, using a ton of wireless data. the app would be much better as multiple singlefunction apps. i mean, do i really need to log in to qb to snap a pic of a receipt and submit it for later? typical quickbooks bad experience. very disappointing.
. hands down the worst customer service system i've ever dealt with. not once have i called that i wasn't on hold for 15 minutes to then have the person transfer me to someone else because they couldn't help me. i'm currently having the money taken from my account but am being told my account doesn't exist and i have to sign up for a new one.
great online accounting software. easy to use, available from everywhere.
good but need more adding. covers all your needs a lot of options, nice app, few missing things like no specific area for the barcode when you creat a new item. it’s friendly use but need more simplicity other than that it’s ok
. quickbooks has always been a great product
. this software has been critical in keeping track of invoices.
works great. this app gives me the functions i need from my phone.
. excellent does everything i need
how bad????. i would love to write a review, but as i've been trying to get this app to log in to my online account for 5 months now it's going to be a little difficult. but not as difficult as trying to get any customer support for this app. i could write a whole book on how impossible that is. so so disappointed. no help with this problem what so ever. frustrated!!!!!
crashes with galaxy s7 edge android 6.0.1. i have a new samsung galaxy s7 edge running android 6.0.1. every time i try to log into the app it crashes when signing in and offers to send a report. but the send crash report button results in blue screen. have to force close. very frustrated as i am used to using the app constantly. update: customer support was able to assist with the issue once i emailed them.
. inuit customer service is a joke
. love this app
michael. great for my business nice to alter estimates and convert to invoice on the job, why do you need acsess to phone and gps
. edit 12319: thanks for the fix and newer versions. this app has been updated and expanded to be a powerful tool on the go. crash problem fixed. love qbo i love that this app is a limited version of the qbo for your desktop browser: however, it crashes on start up all the time rendering it useless.
. awesome intuit continues to improve the app. i feel like i get more for my money.
love it. i love the quickbooks program because all of my employees can log into the program from different locations at the same time. it works great with my small business to easily access invoices as well as the payment logs.
seems great so far. this is what i've been waiting for so i can invoice my jobs right on the spot. a few months on and yup this app is amazing works perfectly for what i need.
east coaster. i love the online version. i can use my laptop, ipad or iphone to update, send quotes or invoices and even take payments via email.
. now, can't even access some of my clients from the app. i have sent the error logs several times to intuit, but no response. it keeps getting worse. lacking the fingerprint option to login. also, accepting transactions from bank feed in android not as smooth as it is in iphone. app starts freezing after accepting a few transactions. additionally, progressive invoicing does not work in the app. should make it more useful for accountants though, adding bank reconciliations capability would help.
. i'm getting an error code when i try to click on mileage trips and assign them business or personal. works on desktop but not in phone. other than that it's easy to assign categories for transactions and separate business from personal.
horrible. constant crashes at the worst of times!!! aarrrggghhhh!
makes life a lot easier. thankyou. quick books
excelente aplicación. muy completa, fácil de usar.
great app. i'm a technology consultant and really appreciate the flexibility this app affords for invoicing clients and getting paid on the spot.
cody. no reports. no p&l. can not work with downloaded transactions, which for me is critical. looks good, but is not really useful if your trying to get work done. maybe it will get better!
. good app, has some minor flaws but does work in a pinch when your out on the road and need to do a quick invoice
easy to learn and use. everywhere access, integrated bank and credit card transactions. easy to create transactions on the road.
lacks important functionality. this app doesn’t let you see current bank balances for any account, which is a major oversight. intuit: please add this feature.
ios 13 and later app crashes. the app works well prior to ios 13.0 when opened in an iphone running ios 13 later, the app crashes after faceid login.
brilliant app with loads of features!. so easy to use. so easy to learn. instant bank feeds. invite your accountant & bookkeeper & other users. so much support from intuit & the australian team. what's not to like? intuit have put together a great product for the small to medium business owner. thoroughly recommend this product.
please stop making my sign in. every other fingerprint authentication app on my phone (banking, password manager, file managers) does not nag me to log in via password every other day. why does this app do so? please fix.
. have had an issue with sending invoices through my app for the last 3 days. even after several calls and emails no one can tell me when this will be rectified. poor support and unorganized for such a large company.
. it would be nice to be able to add categories from the app for types of job descriptions
useless after update. quickbooks was wonderful until the most recent update rendered it useless. things won't save. transactions hang up. very frustrating.
. sometimes an app or service gets worse with time. this is one of them. it is stupidly expensive and incredibly unintuitive. please fix the random sign in and sales receipt bug and improve the ui or i will find another product.
sucks. stupid
not a user friendly apps. not flexible
. the best accounting software i've used. though i haven't used a lot to be fair.
awesome business app. real time saver with awesome easy features that makes book keeping a breeze.
. app crashes after login. reinstalled and still the same error. android using pixel 3. super annoying
. great business app
ios 13; don’t do it!. if you need this app to work correctly do not upgrade to ios 13 yet! many bugs... my worst bug: can’t look at any customer info anymore, does not work. yes i uninstalled and reinstalled...
having issues with iphone 11. after installing the app, and attempting to access it results in crashing.
more details... really.. i'm sick of the standard review response... send more details. i haven't even downloaded this yet. but i get the message: login problems. what's so hard about that.
quick book app works amazing!!. love using the app for my tree company lets me be on the road and make up invoices.
great app so far. great app. one thing needed i’d making it easier to change customers info when doing a new invoice for a previous customer but at a new address.
sales tax calculation is wrong. when creating an invoice, the app does not honor customer's sales tax setting. it applies tax even on customers with tax turned off. please fix asap!!!!
great program.. it's easy to use either in the pc or mobile.
. took me a whole while to register an account, just to get: you don't seem to have a subscription.
junk  plagued with issues. this is is great when it works, but is plagued with bugs. as of recently it logs me out to “refresh,” then when i log back it it tells me the account doesn’t exist. i fix this i have to delete the app and reinstall it, every, single, time. and their customer service is terrible. they never have any solutions.
. i find it a bit iffy at the moment. it's designed for bigger businesses. i'm only a burger van. so my business is very small. but it does help me to keep track of my bills
. good accounting software. use it mainly for invoices.
efficient. does all the work, and reminds me to collect on overdue invoices. i love it! not very expensive either!
"can't create account. hi, i'm new to this app and so i've been trying to create a new account. i've filled in all the required details and pressed ""create account"" ,but that's when a window pops up saying, ""missing 'content type' "". and because of that i haven't been able to create an account. please help me, it's been 2 days already since i've installed the app and i really want to be able to explore the great functions of this application!"
. excellent very useful app for business purpose.
worst service. changed a template i have used for invoices and estimates for 5 years without warning or reason i cannot access the ones i sent even one week ago customer service said i was using a classic template and it's gone and not coming back . makes zero sense it's 2017 get a clue . don't buy don't join charge back!
way to much money for the service don't buy into claims. never is up to date loads so slow a total waist of money.
. best app
. i cancelled my subscription over a year ago only to find out they has still been charging my account every month!
qb mobile. this app helps me keep up with invoicing on the run. like being able to invoice immediately and email the customer with payment options
. the green box you have to put your receipt in is every where. the box won't stay the same size no matter how still you keep your camera.
stuff always wrong or glitchy. seems every time i turn on quickbooks by pc or mobile app, something doesn't work! never buy online version, it sucks
east coaster. i love the online version. i can use my laptop, ipad or iphone to update, send quotes or invoices and even take payments via email.
. love it. makes my life so much simpler. i own a dj company and for billing and keeping track of my expenses it works great! plus client service is a+
. great product simple to use. great price. one less headache!
really wish it was hipaa compliant. i have a healthcare related company. my billing process would be a lot easier and faster if i could send invoices through my secure network or if qbo was hipaa compliant.
crash error crash error. quickbooks is a four outta five platform, this app is a one... signs me out and crashes more than once a day!
really needs an easier login. since the last update, logging in is a huge pain. touch id rarely works.fix this.
awesome app. this app really helps me keep track of all my transactions for my pool business. easy to use and has everything i need.
no gst only take !!!!!. why is this an option the the web based but not the app. makes the app useless!!!!!!!!!
limited, buggy, slow... this a majorly limited version of quickbooks online. you really can't do much with it. it also crashes often and is extremely, painstakingly slow. but so is qb online for that matter.
. small business owner. this app is terrible, do not not rely on it. does not work well on android devices, no matter how many times the browser is reset along with strong data connection.
upholstery shop. very good app, help me a lot at upholstery business!
really helpful!!. i am a computer engineer and being able to make estimates and invoices in the field has really helped me!
. awesome easy interface for all your accounting and buisness needs.
can i print invoices from this app. can i print?
doesn't refresh data, data is inconsistent. doesn't refresh data, data is inconsistent
well thought out. truly like the app now. i can import names from my iphone and do many of the things i can do on a main computer. i’d like to see them allow the entering of bills on the app. i’d use that all the time.
huge asset for small business. love the flexibility this app provides. i can do everything from the app that i can do from the desktop although it takes twice as long. however, as a small business owner being the accountant and the laborer it is great having the ability to pull up invoices with clients and email invoices on the go.
. great app when your away from your computer
awesome. this is a great app it's really easy to use with seamless integration with my desktop version. the response has been consistently fast when you process transactions, highly recommend !
. so far i am verry happy with qb online. will update if this changes.
. the software is easy to get started with. however, matters such as how to generate p45, p60, issuing dividends, needs improvement.
. i am unable to open the app passed the sign in page. just continually crashes right after logging in. poor app
"can't log in. been trying to log in but i keep getting the error ""connection to server failed"". it's really disappointing"
very good. one of the best way to do estimate and invoices highly recommended
makes life easy. great app that makes accounting on the fly so simple.
. great app!!
great update. now i can record my expenses.
. we have been using for a couple years now and are very satisfied with the flexibility and reliability of the program. the integration with tsheets is real time saver. highly recommend
. thank you for the update guys 😊 perfect accounting app for my firm
. i love the app for onsite estimating and invoicing where ever. a few issues is not fully customizing forms and progress invoicing.
setup. it's too hard to set up the payroll using locations. there has to be a better way.
mileage tracking horrible. the mileage tracking is an absolute nightmare. stop trying to use my current locating and let me actual choose the locations i have saved. so, frustrating when your trying to bounce from job to job.
does not comply to govt gst invoice format. does not comply to govt gst invoice format. this could be serious compliance issue for merchants. we are unsubscribing the service due to this reason. will get back when quickbooks invoice format is in compliance with government gst invoice format.
good and bad. i converted from xero and i am finding quickbooks has its advantages & disadvantages. i don’t like how the custom invoices are so restricted with gst. the mobile app banking function is excellent.
. amazing this app can be difficult to get used to, like ensure you use docx to make your templates,and don't use bold ever.. setup your email template etc etc but it ends up being the best app ever.. it's features on the mobile app for invoicing, balance's, incoming and outgoing, tax digitally, are so convenient. i am organized now, and everything is handled for professionally.
best app ever. perfect for my on the go style of operating my plumbing business!
. you did an update on friday afternoon while i need to use the program. now i can't access the program because i need to do an update that o cant do because of a glitch in the update
. super userfriendly! very professional invoices. i love it.
there are other options .... not with the $35 dollars they take in addition to % of every transaction. i would suggest another program and app. i personally would like the app to be able to send reminders for invoices but the app will only send them out.
. love the app. really helps making estimates and sending email to customers. it can also keep up with profit and loss but i haven't been using it. habit of doing it myself
data sync is not working. managed to get it to work. the sync only work after you pay the subscription. doesn't work during trial period. (there is an error syncing data. error code 132. 100. unable to work with it.) another problem with this mobile app is that it is unable to change the status of the estimates.
. i use it à l ot for my activity, great, useful, efficient and greatly appreciated
helps me so much. new business owner, this app has been so helpful. can do estimates send invoices and input expenses from any where, weather im at the store or on the go i can work
great program. great program and its user friendly too.
no complaints!!!. 👍👍👍👍the first business app ever that i'm unable to find anything wrong with. my boss & i love it. it's incredible how close this app comes to the qbo full website in terms of what we're able to access and accomplish using it. leaves all competitors in the dust. keep up the good work qbo!!!
. great app very useful
from xero to quickbooks. i went from sage line 50 (blinkin' expensive but brilliant if your an accountant) to xero (very good for basic invoices but no estimate facilities on the app, no good for my job) to quickbooks online. easy to use. does what i need. reliable and relatively quick.
. continues to make me turn phone off and on or delete app it does not work.
. great app. awesome app!
. user friendly
rubbish. ridiculously hard app! can't even edit or customize invoices with ease on computer. to difficult. better off with myob!!
book keeping made easy. with constant updates this is the go to program for my business! this app assists in daily activity and allows me to be on the move.
easy to follow. app is easy to follow even if you are not an accountant.
. excellent app
. the app has never been that useful and honestly i feel like quickbooks is losing my favor. now the app won't change the dates on reports. we live in a day in age when i expect to be able to access information when and where i need it, and if i can't count on something then i need to move to something i can count on.
best app for small businesses. i own and operate a small it consulting company and this is the best business management app in the world. i can literally walk into an office or home of a new customer, add their information and invoice them on the spot. no need to mail an invoice and wait days or weeks. not to mention its very inexpensive.
works well. i'm surprised this app works so well. it's much less glitchy than the pc program
crashes. keeps crashing. can't use app at all.
changed my rating to 5.. i used to upload all my account transactions from this app. now they are gone. that was the only thing i used the app for. it is now useless to me. ***update*** your suggestion worked. changed my rating.
a pretty good app. update: they added deposits! it does everything i need now, upgrading to 5 star! all in all, this is a pretty great app. it does just about everything i need it to while on the go, but it is missing one key piece of functionality. it does not allow the recording of deposits and that is really important for me. other than that it functions flawlessly and has never given me any trouble. overall, i love it!
good and useful. chamuka
printing receipts. how come you cannot print receipts on the app after you have put a payment through
. almost 2 weeks now the app has not been working. the dashboard is just totally blank. im having to take a toptop to work and tether off my phone.
. made delivering estimates to my customers an immediate action. right from my car in front of their residence.
awesome. this app is perfect
expenses. how can i add a credited amount in expenses? in the qb online mobile apps??
jp contractor. great app for full business functionality and ease of use. price is a a bit high
great app!!!!!. great app for your business. really makes things easier and proactive. it also tracks everything
o melhor!. excelente!!! minha ferramenta de gestão financeira.
stopped working after the update. this was working great until the software update last week. now i end up creating multiple copies of invoices and estimates and the app just freezes on the saving screen. i can only finish off by logging in through a web browser and completing the task. please fix this fast intuit!
. 30day trial
bugs and features not working. there is a lot of potential here but also problems. our accountant would like us to use this software yet some of the features don’t work on the mobile app and even on the website there are still many bugs. the biggest is only a few of the accounts created in chart of accounts are available. most are not available in the app and even on the website are “greyed out” and off limits.
. ok that yiu charge a monthly fee but not ok to charge more than $2 for every payment deposit. will not be using this app for payment anymore. ridiculous!
review me nags frosts mediocre program. for all the noise, qbo is poorly written at best and limiting at worst. but it's all you get to choose from so they're evidently hesitant to improve it. wishing for an alternative.
invoicing. i'm sending invoices easily!
awesome app, love quickbooks. use it often to add expenses and check bank data. nice feature of receipt photo, works great
easy. i'm still on the trial but it helps me move from paper to electronic pretty easily. feels even better that it is all in arms reach.
. best app for tracking my personal expenses easily.
super functional..extremely helpful. quick books app is fantastic! makes using my phone for invoicing and estimates very easy! recommend to anyone..... no glitches, no hang ups..... you won't be disappointed!
love this app!. i absolutely love this app. it allows me to run my business efficiently and effectively!
needs improvement. very few items can be done via app. you can look up balances. needs more work.
dashboard is broken. app needs work.. the app dashboard appears to throw up numbers completely unrelated to reality and almost always reports inability to retrieve all data. the web version, on the other hand, works fine. it seems not much attention has been put into app development. disappointing.
"not working. i just downloaded it and it said it was free. it sent me a verification code. when i went back to the app now it is saying i have no subscription. i wish it could have said that in the begging because now my business email is ""registered"" and i can't find a way to delete my email address from this program."
finally!!!. finally, quickbooks has catered for the truly 'on the go'...and the app is really good too! well done intuit! just need to make this drive down the cost now and then we would really be goo :)
great for start up. the app works great! i can do nearly all of my bookkeeping from my phone. if i need more detailed i just use my laptop! the monthly subscription is nice too!
. does not load half the pages, keep having to link accounts multiple times, made my life hell, avoid
very good mobile app. i use this on my computer and when i noticed that there was an app for android, i immediately installed it on my tablet and phone. a must have if you have a mobile business or have to give invoices on the go.
huge asset for small business. love the flexibility this app provides. i can do everything from the app that i can do from the desktop although it takes twice as long. however, as a small business owner being the accountant and the laborer it is great having the ability to pull up invoices with clients and email invoices on the go.
i love quick books!!!. this app has made doing business easy for our company. it had allowed me to make my car a mobile office. i can do everything i need on the go. i wish the app allowed you to filter accounts by city, state but i am still very happy with it. sky sunner ceo thebloodycure
could not login. couldn't login. just unistalled. seems they haven't fixed this issue yet.
not bad. categorising expenses has been incredibly time consuming to say the least. once you have your data in order you can start to make some decent reports but just getting over that initial hump is frustrating. shortening loadsave times along with better tabular data editing tools would make a big difference.
great software to work on the go. i just love how easy it is to use the software to keep on top of our receivables and payments. very easy to share data amongst our team to become more efficient. much better than using the desktop version
. doesnt work on my acer tablet anymore
. best app to have to keep updated!!!!
an entire office mgmt team in one app. quickbooks literally took me from a life of getting to work at 7:00 a.m. and eventually falling asleep in my chair in front of the computer try to keep up with invoices and tax documents. for 3 months this went on and now about 20 minutes after work and the rest of the night is mine to enjoy. thank you immensely.
total train wreck. importing data from bank has been a disaster. deposits into my bank accounts are showing up in quickbooks as expenses. my books are now impossible to balance.
so very useful!. i run a dog walking business and basically manage my entire business with my s4, this app and a printer. so easy to set up and maintain. i am very happy with quickbooks and would definitely recommend to others.
. having a mobile office means that i am able to do invoices for the business on the run. taking payments are easy too.
they do not fix bugs at all.. constant new annoying bugs that have been around for years now. i have written multiple times to help make them aware, now i have been writing complaints and still no fixes. am literally logging into the app every single time i open it. i have to use this app for my work. no choice. but if you have a choice then you should choose literally any other app. this company is terrible.
crashes when entering a sales receipt. i am new to quickbooks and am super frustrated i can’t enter a simple sales transaction. it crashes every time. disappointing
. terrible app and company. they hold your money and request ridiculous amounts of proof to get it back.
works well on samsung note 2 & 4. i used the app mainly to create invoices when i'm out of the office. it's so awesome to be able to do this on the fly!
. this is an awesome app. make my life so much easier!! it easy to use for my home business.
very nice!. i love have this power in my phone! i can email invoices or print them out, all on my phone! this app is easy to learn and soooooo fast when you get used to it. there was a lot of thinking when they designed this app, wow
. the quickbooks app allows me to easily manage my business expenses on the go and eliminates the need to keep those annoying receipts. instead you can jt take a picture of the receipt and attach it to the expense. brilliant.
. useless. android app does not support in india
. quickbooks is the only company that charges 3.40% for manual transactions when swipe or manual transactions go through the same process. decedent company just takes a lot of money from us small guys
. great app
what a joke!. quick books “backing you” is their slogan, should be backing themselves. only want your data and money. the so called “free trial is another scam.
. it's a great way to create quick estimates and invoices.
ios 11 glitch. hi. since i upgraded to ios 11 the qb app does not allow me to do split transactions. this is a major glitch for me as most transactions are split. please can you get on to this as soon as possible. as a user of intuit software for nearly 20 years i know you'll fix this. thanks for great software.
fix this!. when using my new iphone x the app crashes every time i try selecting the “invoices” button?! also... constantly have to log in and log out to update my information?! why?! please fix these major issues!
. am loving it makes my life so much easier
crashes. won't open. immediately crashes. please fix
. very easy to work with and always someone to help you if problems occur
this app is useless on android.. i can not believe that this app is this bad. i can only see customers invoices that i have been to in last 2 months. i use to be able to see 10 years worth of invoices. please fix asap. unless you can carry a laptop at all times which is not practical this again is useless.
love it. best accounting cloud software there is at the moment and we’ve tried them all. couldn’t recommend enough to other accountants or clients
. great app.
the best. it's simple yet still works. after 10 years i finally have an organized construction company.
i looking. hai friends my name is navas abdulla i'm looking some software live sales report ..in store sales promotions company ..any one can to suggest any live sales, report software for sales promoters www.qmpromotions.com it's my website qmpromotions@gmail.com
it only took intuit 10 years to get it right. finally! a cross platform that works where i do and i don't have to re enter all my data. however the search feature has gone rouge. i want to look at the last 30 days but it crashes every time. yes i have uninstalled ect. poor continuity.
doesn’t work with ios13. just updated ios 13 app doesn’t load. even after deleting and readding.
can’t accept transactions. latest update broke ability to match transactions. it’s like that screen is locked accept buttonsearch or selecting another expense doesn’t work.
"love this app. it is so awesome to be able to login to our accounting software and services do an invoice right from the service location we just finished up on... i can actually send a store manager a estimate sheet as a ""what was done  sign off sheet for his record in the case of a corporate billing. i am so glad i chose qb's online..."
. you can't edit invoice style, and the web version isn't any better. i constantly have to switch between app, website and desktop. the settings and controls aren't easily accessible.
great app but missing some key functions. i've used qb online for a year now and its a great service. the app allows me to invoice and record pymts immediately, however i cant seem to enter expenses. if i could do that it would get 5 stars.
unusable. stopped working after ios 13 update, can't add expenses and support is unresponsive
. great app
where's suppliers gone. since update app does not show suppliers or let you add expense
. great app
amazing app. amazing app that functions well enough to keep track of and coordinate your business.
beyond useless. i have long been frustrated by intuit's decision to bar users on ipads from accessing any real functionality in quickbooks. i thought this app might address that problem, but it does not. it does not offer anything useful to me.
. very easy and convenient
mr. brilliant app
. already did all that: reboot, kill reopen, clear data, network change, reinstall, but it didn't work. have been working with michelle from your team to help out. today it miraculously is working again! what happened?
. very impressed with this userfriendly app!
"great app for distributors. we can invoice and deliver on the fly without having to go back to the office to capture the ""in the moment sales"". our accountant has access and was able to set our account up to match his categories for a fast and no worry tax prep."
so easy. this app is user friendly and intuitive. i like being able to see the reports and add attachments to expenses. highly recommended for small businesses owners.
quick books. great app
update crashed. i have all of my quickbooks point of sale ipads that cannot open the app since the update! we have all had to resort to computers and phones to run our business! you may want to consider this before you join up with quickbooks! they are notorious for problems relating to their quickbooks online.
app ruined. come on!!!!! the app is totally unusable now. can't save invoices, can't email them to the right person and can't create them with the correct info. this is the type of screw up that someone should be fired over.
great for consulting.. works great to invoice customers while on site.
. the previous version didnt update dashboard. this latest version does not run on my samsung s9 at all. quits with an error after signing in. i have uninstalled, reinstalled, still won't work.
not good after update. used to send invoices via email through my phone android before update cannot anymore. called customer service told me to uninstall and reinstall still same problem.. had to buy an ipad in able to send invoices :( horrible!
. good app
. uninstalled right away, seems like a phishing app to me. it requires you to log on to their server. i can't trust my financial information to a 3rd party i know nothing about.
great app. works great for invoicing or estimating on the go. 5 stars if it was completely synced to my laptop. sometimes i don't see estimates that were done in the office available to seeedit on the mobile app.
excellent program. i am so impressed with this new app, it is very easy to use and very helpful for my construction business. i don't even have to go to the office to make an invoice i can do it right in my truck on my phone and send it. i can check on expenses... it's a breeze and worth the time to get to know this app and online program.
works well. i don't use this app a lot but every time i do it was worked well enough.
great app. this app makes keeping up with everything so simple!
good if you use quickbooks for limited functions. lacks access to a lot of what exists in the full browser experience. particularly frustrating that not only can you not create a po, you cannot view them. other simple stuff missing or not quite matched up as far as fields being available for adding products, suppliers, customers etc. in light of them increasing their monthly subscription fees, hopefully some money is going to be spent bringing feature parity to their access tools.
when i am done, i am done!. as a contractor i love to do my estimates one time, hit convert to invoice one time, hit receive payment one time and i am done with my paperwork and money is heading my way before i leave the job site. when i get home i can just spend time with the family rather than swim through paperwork. great service!
not even close to online or desktop versions. at the cost of not wanting to hire a secretary my consultant had me switch to online version from desktop, it sucks! used to update q.b. desktop every 3 yrs (when forced to) for $150 and now pay around $400 a year for less function. the direct qb online site is better from my mobile device than the actual app. the options between app and website dont function the same. terrible!
great app. i love using this as i am away from the office it's so easy to use via phone or tablet
very nice. pretty good mobile app
. excellat ap this app is great. keeps me informed even when i am out in the field. i love it.
great app. i am enjoying staying on top of things while on the go.
. love this app
. perfect app so easy to work with it and so helpful
waste of time. glad i haven't gotten past the trial offer because nothing syncs with my quickbooks online. so the obvious question is what's the freaking point of this app? completely unimpressed. someone's making money off of doing nothing. wow. i want that job!
so easy.. i love using this app, it is a lot easier than the online webpage version. i love it.
. life savor!!! best app for start ups
. great app
. easy to navigate! great app!
. app is great, i use it all the time.
great. does everything i need it to do onsite. kinda wish it looked more like the tablet version though
. very disappointed, missing 6 months of transactions from my bank, tried to fix it as i was instructed to but couldn't, you can't get someone to speak to, no customer service. big joke, i don't recommend it to anyone
"error. i dont even understand why massage always popup said ""failed to connect with server"" when everytime tried to login using this app..send several of email to support team but theres no answer n solution..please do something i am a quickbooks online plus subscriber.."
lacking. app is seriously lacking in functionality. don’t buy quickbooks online unless you plan to do most of your work from a desktop. kind of defeats the purpose. way overpriced and they keep raising the price too :( wish i had stuck with the quickbooks pro platform.
. great app
. working great. the app makes it easy for me to write receipts and invoices quickly from the field and my clients like having an emailed copy of everything i do.
we need an update for iphone x. we need an update for iphone x. in addition, we need the function to add cc recipient when sending out quotes or invoices. other than those 2 things, it is good.
working great, love dashboard. app is easy to use on the go. some things are better done on desktop but for the most part can do a invoice from phone and accept payments.
ridiculous omission. i can not believe that with all of the updates that you still can not create a purchase order with this app. ridiculous.
great !!. has made running my business so much easier !
. works great very user friendly! just wish i could sync it with my square app
. good app!
"bad idea. i downloaded to approve parole only to find i need a second app for that. two out of three ""recognized"" transactions are inaccurate. back to my mac for qb. ugly app guys. sorry..."
no pos. doesn't allow you to create pos. takes out functionality available on the full online version.
. great app. i have enjoyed learning on the uses for it. my only complaint would be the overall price i pay for everything. i feel like i get nickle and dimed on things i feel like should come with my monthly fee. with that being said i still plan on using this since it works very well and it has overall saved me time.
great app. it works flawlessly. does what it says. clean design
jordan hugo ,. i'm young and in business , only small but this app is perfect for tracking my expenses and sending quotes off. highly recommend.
i run my biz from the app!. i use qb constantly to invoice clients and log incoming checks. it's great for following up on past dues & creating invoices on the go.
great for business on the move. this app is a solid connection to your quickbooks and allows for quick and straightforward posting of expenses, invoices and estimates.
game changer. changed the way i handle my business transactions. from a simple to complex my invoices and estimates are presentable, traceable and accounted for. my reports help me secure loans in a flash. and my accountant loves me.
great app. i love this app. it's very helpful and easy to use. keeps everything organized and in order easy to look up at any time. i highly recommend it for all small businesses. it will definitely make your life a lot easier.
will not let me access my info!!!. ever since i got new phones for my technicians ,samsung s5, i have not been able to access any of my customers, transactions, or invoices. i use qbo for my business, but have now lost all mobile capabilities. if not resolved, i will be forced to use a different accounting software. 5 stars if working properly.
the website & app can not connect. i input the expenses transaction in my computer website (put all the details) and when i opened the apps on my iphone, all my transactions called (no category) what should i do? alrdy delete & reinstalled tho.
over promised, under delivered. the desktop app is slow and the mobile app is lacking pretty important features. their tech support is horrible and can take days to resolve an issue....if they even admit that there is an issue.
new business.. very user friendly. almost like apple designed it. very unhappy that the email function doesn’t work. many people have complained for over a year and quickbooks still hasn’t offered a fix😠. i have to take a screenshot and copy and paste to my email. not as professional looking, but gets the job done. that one glitch took away two stars because i can’t use my mobile phone to give someone an invoice or estimate.
. terrible service. automated systems will keep hitting your bank account causing all kinds of problems. be ware giving them access to your bank info
great accounting app. i've been using the quickbooks app for a over a year now and i love how it allows me to stay on top of my business accounting. i love that the app allows me to take a snapshot of my receipts and link them to their corresponding expense transactions within quickbooks.
. there was supposed to be a 30day free trial and they charged me anyway this app is not recommended.
great app, very useful and always improving!. this app is the greatest tool in our businesses ability to streamline work, easy to use.
new ios too many bugs. cannot open customer invoices. please correct asap!
amazing app. i got this because of danny devito
access to every thing now. great app
app crashing multiple devices (ios 10 & ios 11). i use this app for my business and after the last update the app has been completely useless on my ipad and on my phone. the only way i can log data is by sitting at my computer when i get home from work. please fix asap. using freshbooks until then. thanks.
great app. i've been using qbo for about 6 months and i love it. i own a real estate firm (small scale, 5 agents and below) and quickbooks has saved me a lot of time and helped organize my business.
best thing i did for my business. very easy to learn and work with. now i can make invoices on my phone, tablet or computer and get paid fast. plus it is easy to pay employees and keep track
love the app. honestly this is the best app around, does it all with ease. i run my whole business through this app off my phone and tablet. never once had a problem.
great app. this is a great app to have if you use quickbooks. glad to have it available to me!
don't work. don't start. when when it does it don't show all of invoices that are enter
. made my life easier....
ios 13 incompatible. was using this app, working fine on my ipad with ios 12 but updated phone to ios 13 and will not load app but crashes every time i open it. i’m not paying for a dud app. fix it or refund my subscription.
problems. what my bookkeeper is finding is payments being applied to the wrong invoices. it’s really messed things up. from the checks being deposited from my bank. also, for some reason my quickbooks is duplicating invoices. i will have to erase the app and download again.
great app!. i'm in love with this app, too bad that the proadvisor app doesn't work as sharp (doesn't work at all).
quick books. very easy to use but would like more design layout of a custom invoice
not good for my use. i would like to have a setting to hide all account information so i can have employees out with ipads giving estimates or quotes. this is for personal business. good for that but forget trying to take pictures of receipts to write expenses.. takes longer than scanning them on my pc
simple and easy. i find the app and the computer program simple and easy to navigate. i operate my small business using quickbooks and i am yet to have an issue.
access. this app is great. it is so nice to be out in the field looking at a project and make an estimate right then and there while things are fresh in your mind. not to mention for the quick service call we are able to make our invoice right there and present it when we are complete with the work. aloha po'okela lawn service kailua, hawaii
messrs. great app, makes life for an accountant easy
. app worked good for the first couple of months but now hasn't work for a few days straight on my samsung phone. emailed the report to them but have received no reply.
update issues. i have used this app for years with no operating issues. unfortunately the last two updates have disrupted my business flow. now i can't even open the app. hopefully with the recent price increase intuit will have the resources to figure this out. my rating is based on recent update experiences.
. this app works really good makes owning a service business simple. love that i can get done at a customers house and send an invoice
. this app is horrible. why make something so bad? it needs a complete overhaul. i can't email receipts to an inbox, income transactions don't show gst amount like expenses, i can't view pdf receipts. it's just all round ugly and cumbersome and i've only used it for five minutes. i thought the xero app was bad but it's 5 stars compared to this trash. deleted.
crash books pro. this terrific app asks you every few minutes to rate their program knowing that you want to tell the world how you can't send out an invoice without the app crashing. *update* i am having more issues with the app then ever. i can only assume quickbooks is either more useless then i thought. or they are retaliating for my review of their product. i have never had any program work this bad and i have worked it.
for last month since major online update its is useless. when i login it tells me i don’t have a subscription. i call support they tell me to uninstall the app and reinstall. after reinstall the login works but you cannot switch between your companies. i called them back. they said no one else is reporting this. three users in my offivr are having the same problem. i love the iphone app for entering receipts on the go but i can’t even do that now.
so far i have enjoyed the freedom from sitting at my computer. i can make estimates send invoices and do my banking right on my phone anytime anyplace.. sweet app
great app. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😊😊
le hacen falta mas herramientas. le hacen falta mas herramientas.
. love my qb app! keeps me organized and ontrack... in real time. my accountant loves that!
fantastic features. all the features that works under this single app. i used to work with excel spreadsheet, invoice app, expense app to complete the business on the go. now everything has being simplify into this one subscription saving me time and double entry. i am absolutely happy that i can email invoice, take pictures and enter expense using my iphone. best of all these is update into the cloud. great excellent accounting software nothing comes close after trying others accounting software.
great app. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😊😊
great tool for those on the go!. while there is a lot of functionality missing that would make this app even more convenient, what it does offer is a tremendous help while on the go. from creating invoices to recording expenses to seeing your p&l and balance sheet, this app is a great tool and extremely easy to use!
. best app for doing business on the go! best customer service by far!
i can't look up pertinent information. i can't look up pertinent information on the go while i am meeting with clients, such as a yearly sales history. doesn't do much good for the small business owner. definitely not worth paying so much money for an app that has no functionality in the field.
i'd complain about crashing. but it won't even open. i used this app every single day for years, now its trash?! get it working please. i have paperwork that needs to get done.
. sales orders need sales orders! those are our work orders. please add sales orders 43013 still incomplete without sales orders. we are a service based company and sales orders our are work orders. need this addition please. thank you, white pines electric inc.************************************* 91713 still no sales orders! still no sales orders! *************************************************1142014
useless. maybe im missing something, but wouldn't the point of accessing you accounting software to be to actually get useful info? you cant even see bank accounts or balances. why have a way to make payments without seeing whats in your accounts?
quickbooks online for the ipad. it works great!! anywhere at anytime. create your customers, create the estimate and then bill it out!! if your smart you will setup the direct payment to your bank account too!!
update killed the app. after this last update i can't save to add payments or invoices. can't even take a credit card. it's killing me.
love it. i love the quickbooks program because all of my employees can log into the program from different locations at the same time.
improving. intuit continues to refine the app. it will really shine when they incorporate a robust pos system that shares items across their own platforms.
can't save an invoice since update.. please fix asap. i use to use this app everyday and now i can't. i love quickbooks but this is bad!!
hate it. i officially hate this program and will be changing to another accounting software in july. i have been using quickbooks since 2000 and used to love its simplicity but it has become time consuming and harder to use. make a mistake...can't fix it. if you are away you can' access all the feature using the app  you find a computer and log on.
your only retail software. simply the best !
good, but not comprehensive. it is useful for seeing a basic snapshot of your company, but lacks some of the more useful functions (such as, for us at least, paying employees, reconciling accounts, and viewing job profitability reports).
i love quickbooks!. if you have a small business, using quickbooks is a no brainer! awesome program and i would highly recommend it!
works great. enjoying quickbooks online makes looking at invoices while out of the office really easy. great features
. dashboard does not load. completely useless at this point. cannot invoice, add expenses or write sales receipts.
. easy entry method. looking 4ward2 sending out invoices and payment methods.
👍. excellent app!
never worked. downloaded app but it has consistently failed to open. only the message 'unfortunately quickbooks online has stopped'. tried all the suggested work rounds, uninstall, clear data, clear cache. called help centre and their agent couldn't have been any more disinterested. appalling customer service. not worth subscribing. dreadful service.
. this app is awesome!!!!!
awesome. i've been using quickbooks for years the online and mobile app is the only way to go
. great app.
difference maker. love the program, made it much easier to price jobs, track paidunpaid invoices and keeps track of all business info
highly recommended!!. makes it so easy to run my business from anywhere. definitely worth setting up if your out n about all the time or not to tech savvy. simple to use, there is tons of tutorials on their website.
". i hate it. you can't do ""billable"" expenses from the app. you cant edit invoices that have been sent. terrible. i hate it."
changed my business. this app has worked wonderfully. it fills the role of a second employee. accounting has never been so easy for both myself and for my clients to complete their bill.
bugs and bugs it a jungle. 1. kicking out of the app very often. 2. not able to email multiple invoices at one time. 3. limited search capabilities. cant search notes and description. :(
. absolutely useless!! you cannot access anything except invoicing and payments. un installing right now! what a waste!
simple and easy.. great program, easily accessible. this program does seem a touch too simplified, and an enterprise version that runs and feels like this would be great.
. qb desktop has a far superior user interface i did not realize that this is not the same program
very good app.. really like this app.
. good app
. doesn't have any of the essential functions.
can't login. every time i try to login it says that i don't have an online subscription.
. bomb app andvery, very helpful, and useful!!! =)
easy but very limited. maybe i was not schooled enough on the app, but i have the need to print reports and invoices. i could not find an option to that.
happy user. switched from desktop to online a couple years ago and love it. works great on all our devices and can s me invoices in the field right after we perform a job. love the continual improvements also.
. dreadful experience so far. bought qb 16th dec 2019 and cant get a call back from an english speaker to help me with set up despite multiple attempts! why is sales uk based but support isnt? this is 2nd review  1st disappeared!!! so disappointed and very desperate to get started. i can login to qb online but says im in usa not uk. i have emailed you twice now. still no reply.
grateful for this software. i have an easy time figuring it out. overall i like this app. thanks would like to have a few other features like an easy way to delete mistakes. 102014. the customer support and tech support is awesone! fast, accurate and efficient! thank you.
. is this app available for india customer?
new update keeps crashing. well ever hour or two it crashes while i am in the middle of looking things up or when i am making an estimate for a customer. and this is with the pastiest update. oh and it keeps telling me there is a new update, but i already have it. fix it, my renewal is coming up and you aren’t the only game in town
wow!. really cool app! it's linked on all my device! i can make invoices on my phone and send it to my clients directly from email! cool stuff!
. very good app for small business owners
. very helpful tool for smb owners, easy of tracking payments and expenses.. loving it..
". made an payment 3 days ago and still getting an error ""subscription error"" ereceipt sent. update, it's been 5 days and i'm still locked out of my account after payment was made. quickbooks has offered to transfer payment method directly to them. google play informed me that quickbooks refuses to refund my subscription, while quickbooks denies that that is the case. fyi been a quickbooks user for 3 years now, and never had an issue, til now."
so far so good. it's not fussy like sage one. just nice and simple. it's saved me time just to do my invoices worth it for that.
invoice missing. i sent an invoice from my computer but is not recorded in mobile app. prob wont be buying
easy to use and great for tracking transactions. navigation is straightforward and the software updates quickly
pretty good. pretty good for mobile version. would like to see easier to read interface. rating should be 3.5 because when adding payments you can't assign to bank account and then you have to log back in from desktop and fix which gets old.
customer name. can't see contact name but i can see fax # who uses that please fix so we can ss the contact persons name on page with phone # this should be an easy fix
. app is great once you practice it
sad. please bring back the mobile app. the online needs improvements. going back to spreadsheets thank you qb.
its ok. i was hoping for this app to have mobile printing capabilities so we can set up thermal printers.
"can't add unit with quality and rate in invoice. online version does not allow customisation of fields. invoice doesn't show ""unit"" with quantity and rate as a result invoice are unusable in real world. hope developer address these issue at priority before we users move to other applications."
. consistently slow and glitchy. slightly better than the computer program, but still not the most user friendly.
. keeping on track with my biz for the first time ever really! i wish there was the ability to add a pic for expenses in the memo part on the mobile app tho. edit, figured it out, dope~!
total crap. this app doesn't work. it shows numbers which doesn't make sense, you can't rely on it. i just go to safari web and login to my quick books account. please change it if you can.
. great app, easy to use!
it's not like the desktop version. why doesn't this have the same functionality as the desktop version? what a joke it is. i am so ready to switch to anything else!
update google signin never works. update: quickbooks support contacted me. i uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it works now.  i have tried and tried to get into the quickbooks app using the google signin. i get it to work maybe 1 out of every 50 times i try to login. i don't know why they haven't fixed this issue yet. i always end up logging in on my mobile browser instead. fail
absolutely amazing highly recommend. way better then xero and myob.
. some months ago, the functionality to add attachments to expenses stopped working, never got fixed. today the function to create expenses has vanished. is anyone actually testing this before it gets released?
. loving this app. super easy to use.
easy for newbie. started out with the desktop version of qb and migrated to the qbo platform. so much better for me and easy to use now. i can send a quote from my phone and then invoice once the job is complete which for a lazy guy like me keeps me on tasks done billing times quicker. highly recommended
. superb app superb app
. awesome account software
bid sheetcost. it would be awesome if the was a template for a bid and not just an estimate. also, qbo is too expensive.
good app and service. after the last update, i can’t create an invoice after i add a customer. it crashes every time on my ipad. it still works on my phone. please fix this issue.
. terrible. does not recognize my company credit card as a credit card, add o i couldn't add expense charged to it. doesnt recognize my cash account from my chart of accounts for when i tried to apply a cash receipt. clearly not ready for prime time.
update killed the app. after this last update i can't save to add payments or invoices. can't even take a credit card. it's killing me.
good app. this app is great for on the go but still needs a few things to be fixed like when i mail the invoices or estimates to my customers they always have trouble recieving them..
needs improvement. i love the desktop version but my app version and even the online version never works right! there is always something that doesn't work. i always go through the whole estimate or invoice and then it won't save it for me! very frustrating and i wish they could work out all of the kinks.
keeps crashing. keeps crashing and doesn't track mileage for work and charity. really disappointing.
glitchy software loses emails really crappy support. issues remain for years intuit does not fix. loses emails all the time invoices say sent when they are not.
. all of my accounting is done through this app from quotes to invoicing. i also use this app for payments from clients with credit card.
no purchase orders. for years now quickbooks has withheld the ability to create purchase orders through the mobile app. this is a huge issue for our company and it is quite frustrating that qb has willfully omitted this feature. i wish there was a way to convince qb to change course on this decision...
. ease of use with lots of support
great app. i run a it buisness. have loved using this app. i love being able to do invoices while i'm away from my computer.
brilliant app with loads of features!. so easy to use. so easy to learn. instant bank feeds. invite your accountant & bookkeeper & other users. so much support from intuit & the australian team. what's not to like? intuit have put together a great product for the small to medium business owner. thoroughly recommend this product.
. love the app. really helps making estimates and sending email to customers. it can also keep up with profit and loss but i haven't been using it. habit of doing it myself
great to app to have. loving the app. i would give it 5 stars if it was able to function the same or close to the online version.
progressive payments. love the accessibility and simpleness of creating invoices. would love to see progressive invoicing added to quickbooks online
. being mainly a cis contractor it won't let me make invoices in app so have to use browser which doesn't work so have to wait till i get home to invoice from laptop. any chance of this being resolved
. fast and easy way for billing. i don't know what i was doing with out this app.
broken in ios 13. need a fix urgently
time expense and mileage. great product. inconsistent functionality across desktop, iphone and ipad. for us professional service peeps can we have time expense and mileage please!
does not work. i have just spotted an ad on the bus in london. installd the app. created an account. it was difficult to activate my account as the app does not read sms itself. all in all, after logon the carches  it is not unable at all. i use galaxy s6.
. this app is making my life life much easier!
loving it. i have never done reviews but i started my own business 6 months ago and having access like what is given to do invoices and billing is awesome
pretty good. it has improved over the years but still needs work. one thing that needs improved is that once an invoice is created its harder to edit a line item without deleting it and reentering the line item. entering payments is not as easy with the app is it is with the web based version. i always use the web based version when possible.
so helpful. i am a small biz so this really gives me the flexibility i need to do accounting on my phone. it's really helpful. quickbooks itself is a great software and the app really shows its quality. many thanks ~j
essential. great for ontheroad expense tracking.
why???. for the love of gawd, why can i not add a delayed charge on the mobile app?????? this is something you actually want to do when you're at a client, not get them to sign for an invoice every time you visit them during the month.
. great app.
. great extension to the desktop version. this app is most helpful on an onthego situation. reduced bookkeeping cost.
. it won't sync with my account and often won't open. update: after emailing my info to the email they responded with, i never heard back. i also called and was told that they'll work on it and email me. haven't heard yet, maybe next week.
. i haven't been able to update a draft invoice via mobile in over 2 years and it's been a known issue? instead of adding new reports all the time, work on the basics please.
not bad needs a little work. online is getting better with each update. i love the update with the option to deposit money in different accounts
cannot log in. garbage. terrible customer service!
app crashes constantly. i used to love this app. the last couple of months the app crashes daily and multiple times. i’m in the middle of working and the app says critical updates are needed and logs me out. i’m extremely frustrated with this considering i pay over $20month to use this software across all my devices.
no longer loads. after upgrading quickbooks online, this app no longer loads on ipad or iphone. please fix.
. better program than the internet site on my mac book pro! very easy to use and very seem less operation.
. awesome app that assists me to carry out my personal finance activities
brilliant app. quickbooks is an amazing app. i'm an electrician with a small business, so i need something quick and easy when i'm in the field. entering expenses and creating invoices is so easy on my tablet andor phone saving me hours per week. great work...i'm very impressed!
. i like the apps easy access but it truly suck because nothing is accessable properly. writing an estimate or invoice on this app is not possible. not properly anyway. its really not pleasant either going online via cellphone because it zooms in and out improperly. its very frustrating. as for quickbooks via laptop i love it. quickbooks has truly made my life much easier and way more organized. but the app needs to be fixed and also online via cellphone bugs.
it worked for 1 month. ... then i upgraded to android 7 and i can't log in. i've sent 3 emails to support to report error with no reply.
. after eading all the problems and seeing 90% of the reviews being 1 star im going to save a headache on this scam app should be taken off the market or sued for false advertising and costing people thousands of dollars. all the responses from support sound like they are prewritten for the complaints. please take app off the market and quit ruing the admin side of peoples hard work to start a business.
app. great
logo. this is a great mobile app but i wish you could put your own logo on the invoices.
. very efficient, very useful
great app. overall its a great app. you can do many things from the app that you can do on the desktop version. i would like to be able to enter the worked hours on the app and also to be able register vendor invoices not only expenses.
. never could get it to work, after months of paying and a call into quickbooks (who do not support the product if bought through the playstore or apple store), i gave up trying to use this software. $160 out the window with not a single useful action resulting from owning this product.
. seriously guys, this app is constantly updated, but still moves at a glacial pace and consistently crashes. get your business in order so we can keep ours in order!
cannot link to amex. caution, you can no longer use the mobile app to link to your american express account. i first installed it in 2015 it was awesome because it linked to my american express account and i could go through and enter them into quickbooks very easily. now unfortunately they have just simply discontinued that feature for some reason and their technical support people refuse to even acknowledge that they used to do it in the first place
new receipt identification is much worse. the new version of the identification of receipts when taking a picture to upload to an expense is much much worse than the previous implementation. this version hasn’t worked accurately once in 30+ pictures, whereas the old version worked accurately 90%+ of the time. how does this stuff get through testing...? :
. great app
google signin never works. i have tried and tried to get into the quickbooks app using the google signin. i get it to work maybe 1 out of every 50 times i try to login. i don't know why they haven't fixed this issue yet. i always end up logging in on my mobile browser instead. fail
great, but can learn from others. just my observations: mobile app should be mostly used to record expenses. it lacks ocr tracing. moreover scanning a receipt is a multistep process. should add forcetouch to add receipt (open in camera). invoices: been searching how to add my banking information. cannot believe quickbooks does not allow for adding banking information to invoices. did i miss something? or is it a hidden feature? not very intuitive (pun intended). otherwise good. like the integration with bank account.
changed my rating to 5.. i used to upload all my account transactions from this app. now they are gone. that was the only thing i used the app for. it is now useless to me. ***update*** your suggestion worked. changed my rating.
great compliment to qb online. been using qb for over 10 years. recently switched to online and added this app. amazing ease of use and highly functional.
crashes with ios 13. just a heads up. when you try to take a picture of a receipt to upload to the account, the app freezes up and you can’t continue on. restarting the app doesn’t work either.
. we tried the free trial before purchasing.. quick books keeps changing my partially paid invoice to paid in full .. when i called tech support he told me to fix this problem its 129.00he was rude and started to raise his voice after i started hows it possible i have to pay that much for a free trial app when they are the ones causing the problem... quick books is no good.. and their tech support is the rudest customer service i've ever heard!
new update has stopped my app from working!!!. since the update i now can’t accept anything or change anything!!! the only thing i can do it add the expenses!!!! sort it out please!!!!!
. totals liability accounts into expenses in most cases and ends up double counting items.
convenient. can enter sales receipts and expenses into quick books away from the office. that's a useful add on to their online program.
excellent app. i used to use invoice2go and since moving to quick books online it makes everything so much easier i can sync to my bank accounts and this itself is saving me time reconciling is a breeze now.
glitchy, incomplete features, and poor data. this app needs serious attention. after years of putting up with this hot mess i’m fed up and rarely use it any more. no matter what i do i can’t get data to load that is any more recent than 2016 for most vendors. no one from tech support replies  ever. american express transactions can’t be synched or approved in the app. about the only thing it’s useful for is matching typical transactions in our checking account.
. great app to start your own bussines!
. partial capability cant load expenses in the droid version but can on the apple version. expense management is important. a small thing that has a big impact. wouldnt take much to do and make it five stars.
. good app
. great app
ease of use. simple and intuitive. makes it easy to review accounts on the go and create invoices onsite.
. problems sending invoices. update to customers from ipad doesn't always work. other issues. still a good app.
"not useful at all. disappointing that it comes with the name ""quickbooks"" yet it doesn't actually allow you to really do that much. you can't run reports, check accounts, etc."
this mobile version sucks. you can't do all the things you need to make the forms as you can on your computer. and if you have the old online version on your computer do not update to the new version you'll likely wish you hadn't.
doesnt seem to work on lg g4. cant even log in to the app.raised it with quickbooks support over a month and we still cant seem to get it working
great wee app. i've had this app a few week very easy to work with.
latest app update. this update is terrible basically unusable please change it back asap
fix it!!!!!!!!. when it works i like it, but when it flips out it is so frustrating. every time they update it it takes another couple updates to fix it. leave well enough alone!
can invoice from anywhere. i can start invoices at the gym and finish them at the office ! no longer putting things off and forgetting about them we love it!
help full app. it really helps my business being organized and has a lot of features
new update is amazing. incredibly user friendly with additions of dashboards
how do i remove this app from my iphone?. i do not want to use thus app and now i cannot uninstall it from my iphone. l try by holding the icon and get a message asking if i want to share it. does not show in my settings so i cannot delete it there either. can't find online help.
works and convenient. easy way to enter sales and expenses. i've had no problems with this app.
. does not work as advertised
excellent online software. i love this system made my job a lot easier my phone is my office
. best app for accounting purpose
. app keeps closing right after opening even after uninstalling and then installing and also clearing app cache and data. the only update available to me is the 19.5.2
a small business must have. i have used quickbooks pro for my small company for many years, but i can't believe i have gotten this far without this app.
nogo on ipad pro. doesn't look good on ipad pro and doesn't support split screen. need to be able to have qb open on one side and my project system on the other to create invoices.
breathtaking!!. wow this is an incredible app. i have searched for personal finance software for a long time and it has been a major headache. using quickbooks online is amazing. if they continue to add features to the online product to rival their desktop version i recommend they move completely to the cloud!! so good.
integrated desktop platform. i wish they made a desktop software and qbo for mobile. not qbo for all.
more reports please. i wish i could see more information in reports, even if they have to be precanned reports. i understand the app is more for onthego, but it would be incredibly useful for me.
great app!. this app has saved me tons of time and i love it!
qb online. tout ce qu'il faut pour la pme. facilité, mobilité, flexibilité! un support technique accessible, compétent et rapide.
great accounting. allows me to manage everything onthego. powerful software for small and medium size business.
awesome app, love quickbooks. use it often to add expenses and check bank data. nice feature of receipt photo, works great
awesome software. easy, user friendly, easy to organize and update!
new update issues. the previous update solved these issues, but this current update causes error messages with sales rep login whenever creating invoices, and also causes printing communication errors constantly.
poor need lots of work. this app is terrible on the ios and android. i’m using it on both and it has tooo many bugs...
great application. very handy for revenue and business expenses.
. can generate and send invoices with the app which saves me a lot of time each week. love it
simply doesn't work. my companies all use qb online. i access it via browser almost daily. this app routes me to an advertisement to switch to qb online, even if i use the admin credentials. i'll assume it's something with all of my accounts and not a shameless advertising plug.
intuitive and very useful!. i'm surprised at how easy this app is to use and how much functionality it has. i'm able to do pretty much all of my typical day to day tasks within this app. it's extremely useful to be able to quickly put together an estimate for a client from my phone or categorize a transaction. intuit, you've done a great job here!
fantastic app. love love love this app. so easy to use, a must for any small business
great app. works great for managing customers and invoices for our company!
. good app
great app when it works.... after update to ios 13 as well as the latest version of the qbo app, i cannot access supplier information. on top of that, i am unable to save expenses that i am trying to enter too. there goes the productivity. qbo team really need to be better at this!
app is almost useless for me.. the only reason i upgraded to quickbooks on line was so that i could do estimates and invoicing on site. this app will allow me to do an estimate but will not let me do a partial invoice. if i can’t do a partial invoice on the app it’s simply a waste of time for my small fencing business.
user role permission not supported. custom user role not supported on ipad. quickbooks recommends you to use online but the invoice interface is “blowout from screen” in chrome and safari and no available signature from customer. its annoying to use it online. this happens, at least, when the user have custom role, just permission for sales for instance.
great tool for simple bookkeeping. my business is only income and expenses and cash basis, no inventory, so this tool is great and easy. i do all my book keeping from my phone.
. there are many bugs and glitches. the ios version allows bank feed updates and this one doesn't!! still doesn't. still buggy.
overall ok. if you have an issue good luck getting a hold of customer support. freezes up at least once a week and sometimes i can’t get into my invoices. for what i am paying for i expect more
good when i'm away from my cpu. i didn't expect a full service app. but it's still a great app when i need to get something done on the fly.
. good app
". 6.10.19  i hate it. you can't do ""billable"" expenses from the app. you cant edit invoices that have been sent. terrible. i hate it. 8.12.19  still hate it. noone has ""investigated""my situation. 👎👎 12.5.19. yup.. still hate it. i use it but cringe every single time i open it. pos app. 1.3.20 still hate it no ""billable button"". zero stars"
app fails to load on iphone x. failed to start in iphone 6s and iphone x
not a replacement. not fast. doesn't sync well.. this app needs a lot of work to be reliable and usable. no matter how many times i sync it doesn't actually sync to the web apps data. it keeps logging me off the fingerprint option. this might be designed in there because human fingerprints change very often? correct?
. if i invoice a client and they mail check or hand me a check or give me cash i cannot record income unless they pay online bank transfer or credit card. so i cannot accurately. so this app is useless. and horrible client management. also need to be online no offline input. also i cannot merge to qb app each charge 9.99 month. cannot merge date as qb has better customer tracking. also neefs time tracking for jobs
. few issues that are quickly resolved
very easy to use. works great but doesn't email invoices or estimates
quickbooks app. does not work well. needs a lot of improvements. each time i back up my files i end of with multiple copies on my ipad. have called several times and each time they blame the app developer which i have contacted but never heard back from them. poor program that needs fixing to get it up to good standards. do not recommend until they fix problems.
instant customer service 👌. great app for small to mid size business. phenomenal integration from windows 10. so far so good. thanks.
awesome app. helps with all business expenses and just great interface
. very nice updates to the app. easy to use in the go.
"review. i have been using quickbooks since the start of my business, and have found it to be extremely useful!! i don't have one bad thing to say about quickbooks, other then for some reason, which no reason was given to me, i'm not able to set up the ""accept payment"" option it offers. if i could activate that feature i would give quickbooks 5 stars. until then they have a 4 star review from aj's tree service!!"
. i have tried the thrial for my buisness and found it projected profits higher than actual and expenses that didn't match up regardless to synching it to accounts like square or my bank. if this is the trial then im not sold. if i had turned this apps inaccurate projections into the irs they'd audit the hell out of me. ill stick to good old fashion analog style accounting thank you.
my business partner!!!. qb is my real business partner. very easytouse, reliable and an allinone system for my business finances and documentation. the only comment i have is the pricing, it is a bit high monthly premium compared to a few good apps now that are really low priced and even some are free.
working great, love dashboard. app is easy to use on the go. some things are better done on desktop but for the most part can do a invoice from phone and accept payments. would be nice if inventory feature wasn't additional cost
. i have seen personal budgeting apps that have better user experience than this. here just some of the glaring issues:  it forces you to relogin alot, and it does not support google signin, which means you have to retype a complex password every single time  you could use pin login from settings, but it is useless..  it forces pin code reentry everytime you use the camera or switch to another app.
. great software. so easy to use and very reliable.
getting better but a long way left to go. we switched to quickbooks on the recommendation of a number of accountants. then we realized that quickbooks online and the desktop offering are worlds apart. the app is good, but not great. the entire qbo experience is frustrating and getting support is difficult.
. absolutely love this app. we use it to keep our books for our trucking company. it is easy to use and convenient for tracking our business!
. very close to cancelling my subscription as app doesn't work. after adding 45 receipts i get an error message that my request cannot be added and i should call customer support. have tried reinstalling clearing cache signing out and nothing works permanently very frustrated
no longer works with ios 13. i just updated to ios 13. the app now crashes immediately after it tries to launch my company. i tried reinstalling it but no luck. please fix this asap!
worse update ever. finally you eat our petition to add calculator to the invoice keyboard and removed on this update? app freezes a lot
ótimo!. controlo as contas de minha empresa de forma fácil e segura.
. great easy app the only thing i wish i could do what's have the ability to have a customer pay immediately but maybe it does and i just don't know how to use it yet.
fácil de usar. muy buena herramienta para administrar mi negocio👍🏼
not getting started on phone. neither it is getting installed newly on my android phone nor i am able to recover the password of my older account . after collecting all the data it says we don't support it on android in india
. it's useful, but often behind the ios app. still waiting to be able to raise po's on the app  that would be super helpful when onsite with suppliers.
love the app. wish though we could do the same on the phone i can do on the computer.
stopped recognizing transactions. after the last update it stopped recognizing transactions. even after the manual editing, still does not add them to my income. the same with the desktop app. the only difference is that the manual editing works on desktop.
life saver. apart from the fact i have to input my password every time, this app is a great compliment to the version i use on my laptop. so easy to use, can invoice on the spot. very happy.
no bills. has great functions except cannot enter billsinvoices from vendors.
. being mainly a cis contractor it won't let me make invoices in app so have to use browser which doesn't work so have to wait till i get home to invoice from laptop. any chance of this being resolved. please note i have tried multiple phones and it is near impossible on mobile browser. trying to keep keyboard up is a nightmare.
. hi i'm unable to use it on my android phone.please help.
great app. very good have had no issues with it
difference maker. love the program, made it much easier to price jobs, track paidunpaid invoices and keeps track of all business info
. excellant app helped taking the stress out of book keeping
horrible. please update this app so it stops crashing during every use!!! also, critical updates every time you try and do anything???? getting old and frustrating. fix it!!!!! also, why when you update a transaction, it saves it from before the update, so you are doing the work twice???
. i want & need a 5 star but i cannot get any kind of help with my issue , which is i cannot get my invoices to go out via gmail. help!
still can't create po's through app. i use quickbooks for 2 things mainly. to create estimatesinvoices and send pos once the invoice has been paid. i can't create po's with the app so it's useless. i have to go to the website every time i want to create a po. it makes no sense that they would leave this feature out.
banking. great app just the banking doesn’t always pull over on fist couple tries to load transactions
bad customer service and bad app. i’m use only one month is the most terrible app. never used this app
. good good app
great app!. i love the mobility of the app. it helps me stay on top of my bookkeeping work while i'm on the go. makes managing multiple businesses that much easier!
"getting there. qb online is a great service, but slightly glitchy. the app however just gives me an error message when i tap ""banking"". that's the most important feature!!!"
horrible and near useless. often doesn't sync properly with online version, customers and invoices disappear, crashes often. basically... find another solution because this one will only drive you insane.
can't live without it. i don't know how i did business before this app. i love that i can access my company books anywhere. i love the way i can take a photo of the receipts for my expenses. thank you qb!
crashes. since the update to ios 9. totally unusable. i have uninstalled and reinstalled and keeps crashing on my iphone 6+.
refrigeration mechanic. was using invoice2go no bank feed. quickbooks would save me at least 6hrs per quarter. awesome. so glad i swapped. remembers previous bank transfers.
. far too long to load (on new phone). unresponsive and not well developed
qb app is awsome. i really like the options on the app. makes my business easy to run
ran into unsupported transactions within 1 minute.. the app is difficult to navigate, bloated and slow, using a ton of wireless data. the app would be much better as multiple singlefunction apps. i mean, do i really need to log in to qb to snap a pic of a receipt and submit it for later? typical quickbooks bad experience. very disappointing.
no link. why is there no simple way to link it to computer to send information. who made this useless app
handy and convenient.. i love this app. it is easy to use and always have it all at office when you go to do bookkeeping there. reports may be something to add so i could we what customer owe me. thx
"latest upgrade is a disgrace. i have never written a negative review of an upgrade, but the latest version of this app made a great app totally useless. you can no longer receive invoices or reconcile bank balances. do yourself a favor and delete the quickbooks app rather than ""upgrade."" the mobile website is more useful than the app."
great app. would be lost without it, saves me a fortune in accountants fees
. app gets crashed while working, statements can be printed downloads like web version. what is the need for inapp purchase for this app
please: give us delayed charge already!. how many times do we have to ask? for the love of gawd, why can i not add a delayed charge on the mobile app?????? this is something you actually want to do when you're at a client, not get them to sign for an invoice every time you visit them during the month.
needs a lot of improvement. missing a lot of features and information available with the web browser connection. can't see vendor history. can't sort how inboxes etc are listed. a few other issues. freezes often. in the middle of invoice entry, the system bounced me out for some reason, while not saving the work i had entered to date. did that twice. before i closed out and went to pc web connection. i love the possibility this app offers, development need to fix and enhance
. easy to set up and easy to use i reccommend talking to an accountant if your setting up a small business
. made my business so much easier to work with customers and process work through the day rather than when i get home at night
. problems sending invoices. update to customers from ipad doesn't always work. other issues. still a good app.
one step submittal group. very good online software
. fantastic easy and quick to use. makes my life so much easier!
3 year user.. lots of glitches. signs me out within seconds of logging in and there’s many steps just to put items into an invoice or receipt.
. the updating is slow and i have to manually refresh before changes show up.
. i like the service and how quick invoices are sent to claims
cis transactions. cannot carry out cis transactions in the app for some reason, you have to use the web version. this is really annoying and somewhat inconvenient. other than that, a great app....
works well!. this app does what i need it to do. i'm an electrical contractor and i'm able to do all the bookkeeping myself with just a little help. i like the ability to make invoices on the job, enter receipts at stores, and view the status of customers. i would suggest this for any small business. i use the basic service ($10mth) and it's well worth it.
fantastic app for my ipad pro!. i recently acquired an ipad pro to use for my business and instantly downloaded quickbooks to use on the go. this app has been wonderful for sending invoices, logging my expenses, and managing the books in general. so far, i have yet to experience a crash and everything has been working well for my needs!
quickbooks app is a perfect companion to quickbooks online. quickbooks app is a perfect companion to quickbooks online. it works seamlessly allowing you to read through your transactions and even create most of the common tasks. ( with the exception of vat tasks) qb online is the perfect accounts program
app, subscription. cannot updat subscription gives error on can’t upload data, now expired, very frustrating need solution
no american express support. we use american express for expenses and we cannot manage these transactions within the app. not even see them. the app tells me to view quickbooks online in a web browser to manage amex transactions. this makes this app very useless.
wonderful app for freelancers. likes: stores repeat client info  allows for cc payment  allows me to include my company logo and information on each invoice.  alerts me of tardy invoices  provides me with easy to read charts and measure each months incomeexpenses dislikes:  credit card payments incurs a hefty fee rather than a monthly charge  all of my invoices have an intuit logo  customer service is not great
does what it says. works well. takes the place of an accountant, helps the small business man immensely. i believe i'm actually saving money compared to the cost of extra staff to do the same tasks.
. horrible, spent 2 hours trying to cancel subscription. they don't have the cancel button. called them...45 min wait. terrible service.
. doesn't update banking and doesn't have a taxes tab
awful app, won't open. app was working fine until a few days ago. reinstalling doesn't fix it. app opens and a second later disappears. not good for people trying to do their accounts.
weak iphone app, no customer service. really weak app, no customer service. after trying to contact qb customer service, i got no response from anybody at qb. after paying big monthly fees $ i'm switching back to invoice2go, where i got great customer service and my feedbacks were used in improvements.
not industry standard software. this is a clunky, disappointing, entry level piece of work. qb has been available for many years and i cannot believe that, having been recommended to download by our accountant, it feel like it has barely reached beta testing level. a real pity that microsoft money is no longer supported. that’s how to put a piece of software together. i have littleno confidence in the product.
getting there.. this app was the absolute worst waste of time when it was launched. but now they are syncing the interface with the browser based app and it's very useful.
. used since 2000. no problems with this program. love it!
useless. can’t share the online app with my accountant. frustrating and useless!!!!
. make estimates easier highly recommended
what happened to this app??. the quickbooks app used to be a 5 star, user friendly, reliably functional app. since december this app has had issues with freezing, crashing, randomly logging the user out and overall has ran extremely slow. i’ve noticed this on the app for mac as well. while trying to run a business, it would be really nice to have a working invoice and bookkeeping app. please fix this
app shows incorrect transactions. transactions do not match the selected vendor. works when you have few transactions. once you pass 20k it becomes slow and inaccurate.
. this app sucks and has for years! maybe if they charged us $1,000 a month then they could get it to work. maybe they just don't care enough to make it work. samsung galaxy s7 will not show entire history for past customers. mildly important!
only for ar. this app pretty much just acts as a payments rec'd recorder. has no other functionality that i can see. need to enter vendor invoices on the go so it would be nice if , even if it doesn't have full functionality, you could at least handle vendors and customers on the go.
crashes constantly every time i try to use it!. crashes multiple times every time that i try to use the app! on line works fine. the app keeps freezing saying saying critical updates needed! but i already updated app and deleted the app and reinstalled it. i tried everything i could do. so frustrating! older versions worked well. this is on an iphone xmax. newest phone .., latest version ... not working!!
". error message that cannot be fix ""cannot add this invoice, if error continues, please contact support"" that cannot be fix from quickbooks my android app been like this close to 1 month cannot create invoices estimates so on my business suffer cause of that, have use regular computer to create what was said. not good for business all subscriptions are active."
great app. helps me keep everything straight with my business when i'm on the go.
bad program. won't send estimates and invoices. buisness cash flow has been screwed up.
. how about an update to the other app? suggestions that have been requested: 1) access to notes! 2) insert item above or below another on invoice. 3) merchant services integration. 4) take photos and attach to customerjob. 5) time tracking, the ability to punch inout for appts. 6) signature capture...things to be fixed: 1) map link still populates the customers name in the search (this was supposedly fixed, but it isn't). 2) support for custom fields on templates 3) editing of invoices and
garbage. app stinks
easy to use. i've used different programs and by far, quickbooks has been the easiest to use
please add photo ability. please add the ability to upload photos to products and services! you have no idea how much that would simplify my life for me. please! other than that big issue (for me) i'm pretty happy with the way the app works  does all i need it to, except above mentioned issue.
. good overall very happy with this app. my only complaint is that my products are not listed by category like they are on the web based version so it makes it difficult to find items when creating invoices or estimates. the mobile site has this feature (but no option to create estimates), so hopefully the app could have it too?
great app for accounting on the go!. i don't know why people are disappointed in this app it's an app, not an entire accounting software. plus it's free! i love this app. i can create, manage & send invoices on the go. that's all i need to do. it has a simple interface. kudos to qb.
. this software has made it possible for me to run a business having no prior experience, and not really being good at budgeting personally. recommend it at the drop of a hat.
. love the app, makes running my business so much easier.
. after some learning of how it works i find it a very good program to use and suites my needs very happy
. great app. makes it easier to run my business
overdue but great! gorgeous!. this app is way, way overdue, but at least they got it right the first time around. no it doesn't do everything the website does, but nailed, adding buttons (functionality) is the easy part. it's definitely one of the best looking apps on my ipad.
good but needs more. i wish i can record bills in the expences area, and on the banking it will be nice to be able to do transfers, and deposits. other than that this app is been working ok for me.
the best app out there by far. the app is excellent for anyone on the go. easy to upload info from the app. user friendly. tried a few other book keeping apps and found this to be the best by far. every update includes a very useful useable option. 👌🏽👌🏽
update ruined app. crashes constantly and that when you can get in. half the time it’s ‘downloading company data’ and won’t let you do anything. i find this making it actually harder to run my business.
. great for running a small business in my experience
. this app has helped its tracked and it's made things with my accounts look like i know what i'm doing
very user friendly!. quick books makes life simple!
love tracking expenses.. being able to expenses right at the gas pump just makes sense. taking photos of receipts just makes things easier i wish i would've left the desktop app a while ago.
makes my life a lot easier.. i wouldn't reccomend to rely on your smart phone for all functions but for day to day activities it's great. it keeps you updated through out the day and avoids forgetting this later on.
small business. works for our small business, sending invoices is a breeze. just wish it had time sheets to keep track of our employees.
best app. i am using this app for my business. it is so easy and accurate. i really like it.
. terrible. my bank account will not sync and support refuse to contact me. no transactions show up other than the ones that appeared the first time i downloaded this app. definitely not worth paying for the full version.
. excellent love this app.
. awesome app and links with qb online.
. this app is awesome and helps to organize your life and your business habits
failed to run. i installed the program and as soon as i attempted to begin using it, the program crashes and will now not open at all.
. great app
. stress free app
can't save an invoice since update.. please fix asap. i use to use this app everyday and now i can't. i love quickbooks but this is bad!!
easy breezy!. small business owner. everything i need for everywhere i go. i am on the go a lot and i need to be able to keep up with my business regardless. makes my life simpler. thank you!
quickbooks online not working. i paid my subscription thru itunes, got charged but haven’t been able to use it.... it keep giving me a message to subscribe which i already did. contacted apple, itunes, and intuit quickbooks and haven gotten anywhere... frustrating!!!
a whole new level of deluxe. this has taken our construction company to the next level. the reporting, receipt feature and ease of use has made it simple to track p and l of each job
. didn't login in for a couple weeks, and they removed all of my account data. worthless.
. dashboard does not load. completely useless at this point. cannot invoice, add expenses or write sales receipts.
easy to use. this app has been a life saver for starting a business and trying to keep the records straight. makes it easy for my accountant to access my records. good job quickbooks
great. good apps
my customers love this. i'm a piano teacher, and for years, i've been inconsistent with giving receipts to families. now, i can bill them and give them professional quality receipts easily. one thing i must say here: i don't try to keep my bank account records through this app, so i am not qualified to comment on that.
getting better and better. best app in this category.
great app !. great app
bank transactions not loaded. there are several limitations with this app. but my major issue is the inability to load bank transactions. the connected bank account goes sometimes for weeks or months without the transactions transferred to qb. other times they are uploaded every couple of days. there is no option to upload the transactions manually through the app. i called customer service but no one helped. this makes the phone app pretty much useless.
. i started using the app 8 months ago 4 invoices and it works great took a lot of stress out of my bookkeeping
. nice aap
app does not open. after the latest update, the app does not open. it has been a real inconvenience.
. crashes every time. hasn't opened successfully once. tried reinstalling and restarting tablet.
great. great for small businesses. only thing i'd like is for ability to update bank accounts through the ios app.
quality product. i've just taken over the accounts for the business with little experience and knowledge and i have found quickbooks online very easy to use. issuing invoices and running payroll is quick and simple. the support is extremely good too from professionals who know what they are doing not just anybody in a call centre reading a script.
. very hard to work with didn't match up with my phone or my tablet.
. love this app great for my small business
. origionally i wanted to use this app for easy application of spreadsheets and invoices, unfortunately when everything wasn't working out for me, i decided to pull the plug and cancel my subscription. unfortunately, it is hard to get a cancellation and stop the reoccurring payments and it has brought me here. i would recommend that you guys make it easier for others to manage your subscription accounts.
fantastic features. all the features that works under this single app. i used to work with excel spreadsheet, invoice app, expense app to complete the business on the go. now everything has being simplify into this one subscription saving me time and double entry. i am absolutely happy that i can email invoice, take pictures and enter expense using my iphone. best of all these is update into the cloud. great excellent accounting software nothing comes close after trying others accounting software.
great app. i use it for business all the time it helps as my business is mobile always in the vehicle.
excellent interface and convenient app. this app is a life saver and helps me run my small business affairs smoothly. i can submit my invoices and estimates on the go with ease. definitely a must app to have.
great for attaching receipts, not for entering expenses. i love being able to take photos of invoices and receipts and directly attach them to the expense. however, i am unable to add expenses because the app does not have access to my accounts or categories. if there was even a save as a draft option, i would give this a 55. however, i am not able to save any input if i can’t add the account or categories.
newest update ruins app. after updating my app touch id no longer works and i can't receive payments and clear invoices anymore also it makes me sign in every time i open the app , before this update the app worked perfect and deserved a 5 star rating , you have ruined it and made it unusable , you need to fix this.
. i can't even login, there is some kind of bug.
"was great until recently. this used to be a great app until a few weeks ago. now, every morning when we go to open the app it states ""downloading company data"" and does this for hours. we have customers needing to get estimates, pay invoices, etc., but can't because we can't use the app! this just recently started happening. qb can you please fix this issue??? this type of problem shouldn't go on for this long!"
. fantastic and user friendly
awesome app. let's me run the financial end of my business anywhere.
. pretty good app. lots of features like asset register need to be accessed through desktop. ocr not available for receipts on this version
. great app!
. so many glitches. pictures for expenses won't save, multiple expenses are copied when trying to enter just one expense, difficulties entering my password, random closing, disappears off my screens and the icon has to be reset.....very disappointing
great flexibility. love being able to do estimates and invoices on the go.
latest update issue. the latest update does not allow you to create a sales receipt, estimate, invoice, etc., from the customer, you need to go to the home screen to work around it. this is better than the last time this happened (within the last several months) at which point there was no work around. at least we can process cards for now...
compatibility issue?. no problem installing it on my phone but will not install in my tablet, says it's not comoatible (both v6.0.1 marshmallow). what seems to be the problem? huge disappointment from such a well known company!
. quickbooks accounting app is convenient an easy to navigate.
best invoice app. easy to use quickly paid
. app didn't work and it took two bad reviews before i got the right help. thanks for contacting me. i'll try the app a little more and see if it deserves a better rating
great program. i am a startup welding company, so computers are not my strong suit. literally self taught with qb’s help section, and a couple video tutorials. i mange my companies financials, expenses and payables on my own. this is a big feat being a neanderthal who sticks metal together.
muito bom.. excelente!!! minha ferramenta de gestão financeira.
confusing. the guidance on using the app and getting the most from it is not very good  for someone starting out like me, i'm struggling with this.
it's really nice. thanks
. this app was needed a year ago!. i don't know how i started the business without it. mature and reasonably fixable! best finance app in industry. works countries outside us and canada. say saudi arabia
app crashes. this app crashes or cannot save my data on every entry i make. horrible app!!
. i can not believe that this app is this bad. i can only see customers invoices that i have been to in last 2 months. i use to be able to see 10 years worth of invoices. please fix asap. unless you can carry a laptop at all times which is not practical this again is useless. hello quickbooks how about a fix?
okay. i'm new to doing my own bookkeeping and find this product clunky and not very easy to use. issues with importing transactions and program changing dates and the order compared to the bank. it's not very easy to see what account transfers are moving tofrom. it's hard to distinguish credits for debits. poor customer service. no good summary graphs. slow to attach receipts. multiple clicks to do basic things. cuts off file names if there too long.
avoid merchant service. avoid at all cost the merchant services. they preapprove you and then hold on your money for a month before forcing you to refund each transaction you processed with them. i had to call 6 times 1 hour each time and it is still not fixed. they are still holding the funds and it’s been more than a full month. terrible customer service.
very powerful. i appreciate the ability to invoice from my phone. the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the difficulty in entering time when not connected.
a very awesome easy to use tool!. a very awesome easy to use tool! my accountant loves it.
. what an utter waste of my money for initially subscribing to it. very difficult to use. the questions are complicated when declaring expenses. don't bother using this app better keeping your own ledger!
great product. been using qb for 10+ years. moved into the online qb and have been more than pleased. other than the occasional tweak, it's been helpful and easy to use. support is fantastic as well. and,,,,,, they speak english! yeah! thanks qb!. awesome
not working. i have been using for years on my pc and ipad. now all of a sudden the mobile app is not working on my ipad. not recognizing my email. spoke to tech support....supposed to be fixed but it’s not.
useless. why even bother with this app? i can enter a bill from a sub or supplier on the website or the mac app but can only enter paid expenses here? i can do everything i need to do with my business on my iphone without carrying an ipad or macbook air except use the quickbooks app to enter or actually pay bills (only able to record bills already entered as paid). please fix this (or just tell us you’re not fixing it) !!!
quickbooks. super easy to use! i was able to backlog and bring my business up to speed with quickbooks within a few hours after downloading quickbooks! operating the app is fun and accessible!
. cancelling your subscription seems impossible. i've emailed, called, used their help menu. it shouldn't be this hard. still trying to cancel.
data sync is not working. managed to get it to work. the sync only work after you pay the subscription. doesn't work during trial period. (there is an error syncing data. error code 132. 100. unable to work with it.) another problem with this mobile app is that it is unable to change the status of the estimates.
i can't look up pertinent information. i can't look up pertinent information on the go while i am meeting with clients, such as a yearly sales history. doesn't do much good for the small business owner. definitely not worth paying so much money for an app that has no functionality in the field.
doesn’t sync with quickbooks online account. the app isn’t syncing with online account data. was hoping to use the app for quick entry while on the go.
the recent update fixed the problems!. this app seems to be back to normal! 😄 qb online works great for working on the field and being mobile! 😊
too good!. nothing beats qbo for its price and simplicity. easiest system to use for those sme not accounting minded but still need to get the job done!
nothing adds up. when you run a business you want your numbers correct. i don't have time to troubleshoot why your software can't add a simple paypal balance and leaves transactions out. your fired!
very convenient. i love this app. with the pay now option im able to get paid before i even had a chance to get back to the office.
quick books app. great app...use it everyday to run the business.
. awesome app!
almost great. very helpful for my pool service business. just wish i could do delayed charges from the mobile app. i can't believe they haven't included this feature yet.
. not all of my customers show up and neither do all of my past invoices. this makes it impossible to send out invoices unless i want to create a new customer profile every time. so, for my use, this app is effectively useless most of the time.
qb online and ios app. with the online and ios app this is exactly what i needed to be completely mobile. i can start on one and finish on the other.
great app. does what exactly it has to do
talkatone. i love this app.
app keeps crashing. app keeps crashing since i got my new iphone. it opens then closes right away. i’ve tried deleting and installing again, i’ve tried rebooting phone; nothing works. any suggestions would be helpful. thanks
". crashes too much. many times new customers and info can't be seen on the app, unless i uninstall and reinstall!!! i get a ""unable to refresh"" message constantly. it's extremely hard to enter new customers and revise existing ones from the app."
poor. need to put password in every time i start can't write a service invoice and an amount
. simple and straightforward to use. down side is at the moment its not comnecting to thw bank whis is causing mu accounts department teouble
please update to support iphone x. please update to support iphone x
. see once after putting password and user i'd could not able to login it's coming error
helpful. very useful though i see some improvements that could be made.
. this app is one of the most important tools for my business.
. i really like this app just hate just like anything the rate keep going up but ol well i need it!
useless app. used to a quickbooks user a couple of years ago, and it was ok then, but now i have recently returned and find it rubbish. a simple thing like adding a company address is turning out to be an impossible task. total waste of my time. it you are a small business using the app via iphone or ipad forget it. stay away
. amazing app perfect for a small business
worked awesome until latest update. just says error every time i log in. worked great before update however.
great app. very good photo function. so, no need to save receipt.
great app. i love this app. it's very helpful and easy to use. keeps everything organized and in order easy to look up at any time. i highly recommend it for all small businesses. it will definitely make your life a lot easier.
awesome!. i have always enjoyed using quickbooks. over the years i have moved from quickbooks to quickbookspro to quickbooks enterprise and now quickbooks online. this online system is awesome. if integrates well with other systems i use, it’s easy to navigate (once you take the free courses), customer service is excellent when i have issues  and it will move straight into my turbotax corporate filings. love, love, love it!
horrible customer service. product is a great product but the customer service is absolutely horrible!!! i was on holdon the phone with customer service just to be told to call back on monday.
. little slow to open, all in all does what i expected. good for use out of the office.
all around, it's a great product!. i just wish it had a better breakdown of hours billed or units soldcost per unit on the invoices. maybe it's there in the settings to do this, i just haven't figured out how to do it yet. otherwise i love it.
need more. please update so we can have access to more info. products and services, reports, etc.
. it's a great app. i use it all the time with my company. very efficient, and easy to navigate. automatically logs out so no one else can get access to it ( logs out after being in active for a certain amount of time). making banking, estimate invoice, and employees records very easy to keep track of. also love that i can store customers an accept payment online also. only downside sometimes it can be slow but other than that it's outstanding
best accounting software. so easy to use. has so many features.
. works fine on my android phone (granted, i don't use it very often!) but it's 100% buggy in chromebook. i opened it, managed to add one banking item, then it froze. i opened it again, and it froze before i could even load current invoices. uninstalled. i'll keep using the web version
not so great. appears so different on mobile then desktop. allot of functions not available in the app. can’t really use it on the go. for example cannot fill the site details on app as it dose not appear.
disappointed. needs touch id for login, and bugs fixed for ios 8.
great!. running my business has been so much easier since having quick books! invoices are no longer time consuming or hard :)
. voy a evaluar regular, porque con la última actualización ya no puedo usar la app, no me permite ver la información de mi usuario.
cool...fun and smart. nothing but good to say about this app in my opinon
must have for small businesses. this has simplified my life immensely. i no longer have to worry about things falling through the cracks, quickbooks keeps it all in check. solid app, no issues or crashes yet after about 3 months of use.
. app data is never accurate. i have to login via mobile web to get accurate numbers. app is misleading and frustrating
. a very nifty idea, makes life alot easier 👌🏻
buggy. app has been very buggy. for a few months i lost the ability to add expenses and not every time i click on home the app closes. using brand new iphone 7.
not working with ios 13. just crashes
major flaw. the app ui is pretty good and i really like the interface. the problem is that a lot of my invoices are not even viewable on the app. basically anything that has a delayed charge on it won't show up so there is a major glitch there or something.
. s8 plus user. anyone else having issues with pictures getting attached to expenses? getting a error message when trying to save? i've been trying to get it resolved with intuit and no one can help. this is unacceptable.
. ive been in business for years greatperfectawesome...invoices on the smartphone that save accross all devices!
it's great!. love how i can operate on the go with this app. quick and easy
nice app!. i live on my device  from research to book keeping. elegant style and useful! i can do almost everything from my note 2! light years beyond the old quick books that i used 10 years ago! i'm sending invoices in minutes. awesome! update: still a great app on my nexus 6!
what a joke. i am not a software developer and who ever designed this joke is not one either
. very useful app only problem is not have a contract format you can add that please
crashes when entering a sales receipt. i am new to quickbooks and am super frustrated i can’t enter a simple sales transaction. it crashes every time. disappointing
fairly useless. this app is difficult to navigate. it doesn't come close to mimicking qbo for pcs. the functionality is very limited. it's ok for looking up some things but difficult to update info such as logging checks or deposits.
. great app. love it's simplicity.
have to improve in customer support. an ok app for small business.. but horrible customer service.. first starters, you have to call them only during pacific time hours..? so i’m in delaware, which means, if i want to reach them i have to wait to get a live rep. then, their wait time is terrible.. 30+ minutes. ??? so one star for now.. once you guys improve in this area, i’ll be glad to recommend and change rating...
. amazing app.
perfect software for the right companies. i absolutely love it! i have a small freelance design company, so i'm billing for services and commissions. there is nothing i need that it doesn't do and do well. i don't need inventory, estimates or payroll, so this program is about as friendly to me as it could possibly be.
. new update and now all it does is crash!
. hi, is there any option for download ar sheet inexcel on mobile app. kindly let us know.
doesn't send invoices. my customers stopped receiving invoices from me via email. i have to send it to myself and forward to them. customer service is a joke: they think their clients are stupid, their advices are just ridiculous: are you sure you put the email in the right section? really? i had been sending invoices via email before and they all received them.
. makes business so much easier! i love my qb team and all the ways they keep improving!!! i have qb online it links with our local credit union and my cpa its incredible.
. we still can't check bank account balances. tons of missing features.
. didn't get any customer services after emailing them.
. hasn't worked on my android phone for over a week. says error syncing data and rarely loads historical info. lost ability to photo invoices and seems to have lost tax settings as always wants to create them despite setting this up and using for 7 months now. support says they are aware and working in it for a week now
great timesaver. i used the free app and i have made up my mind that i will be purchasing this for my small construction business.
quick rip for me.. i find this app so frustrating and difficult. i have had it for nearly a year, paying for the services i can't even use. i have been trying to cancel it but there seem to be no option on the app. the website is asking me to trial the whole thing again. i can't even call and talk to a person. hhhhelp. i need to cancel.
i need support no one available. i need support trying to do payroll but no one at qb is available. not a very good way to run this business!
useless  data download errors. the app worked great for the past couple years and now all the sudden it keeps crashing when trying to download my data. i own a mobile business and now i'm having to preplan and print invoices before i show up because the app is useless.
unuseable. the developer disabled the ability to paste in your password. i cannot use an app that requires me to spend two minutes pecking in my 28digit password every time i want to use it! enable paste and i will give this app a try.
. best accounting app i have used. the functions in the app has enabled me to easily access clients information to provide information for decision making. best
great tool. its great tool for small business. makes my life easier. recommend to everyone
so good!. quickbooks on my phone is awesome. it’s terribly easy to see old invoices for payment rates and amounts and to get signatures when delivering our wine.
. full details of the most important things to do with the following link from the uk and ireland and wales with company number of the most important things
easy to use and great features. i moved to quickbooks after trying xero, and find it at least as good for my needs and much better value. good foreign currency support, which is important for me.
great app. i have to switch from another accounting software to quickbooks and every thing is easy to use and easy to navigate.i use it on my phone,desktop in the office.i wish i had it ever since i have been using the other accounts software.
happy and safe. at last. an easy to use app that work well for fast quoting and invoicing while on the go. my b2b clients are very impressed on how fast my quotesinvoices come in. it's a great selling point to my business.
. nice concept but still have to buy additional app :(
. compact, quick access anywhere, great customer support, tons of learning videos. it has all i need, and more.
great small business app. just opened up my first company,being a one person office ,secretary, and boss this app is great to help micro manage all your small office responsibilities. it's a great app to email quick quotes onsite for that customer who looking for the job to get done asap. have to say this made my work day is alot easier and definitely is less complicated!!!!
expiring sessions suck. it's a great app and i'm using it all the time but the expiring sessions are infuriating. if you let us use touch id or a pin, don't make our session expire and force us to use our password! it completely defeats the purpose of pintouch id. it doesn't increase security, it's just super annoying. no other app that utilizes touch id does that  not even my banking apps.
on track. keeping track of daily expenditure, and the performance of my business is so much easier with this app.
. game changer. invoicing and tracking expenses just got so easy. it's amazing, and i am only sad i didn't know about it sooner!
. its not user friendly, and nobody cares about it. they just know how to increase subscribers. not enjoying at all.
horrible app even if subscribing!. subscribe to the app yet they want me to pay for a new subscription, waste of money for months!
. awesome ,app way to go. definitely worth the money with the latest updates and great customer service!!! a big big thank you to the great quick books team, the best in the business :)
. how about an update to the other app? suggestions that have been requested: 1) access to notes! 2) insert item above or below another on invoice. 3) merchant services integration. 4) take photos and attach to customerjob. 5) time tracking, the ability to punch inout for appts. 6) signature capture...things to be fixed: 1) map link still populates the customers name in the search (this was supposedly fixed, but it isn't). 2) support for custom fields on templates 3) editing of invoices and
loving it!. very simple and user friendly.
great app. been using for over a year now for keeping track of time for my construction business. works great
great app that scratch. is freezing and scratching often
need o and p. really need to add a way for someone to mark up of the invoice and show change orders to estimates.
. excellent software
. this app makes running a small business a breeze!
. i can not accomplish anything in the app, a blank screen comes up no matter what category i try to go to.
quickbooks  issues and problems. i thought this may be reputable like the brand. boy am i surprised. can't even call to get proper support. they think that a 48 hours turnaround on a request is acceptable these days...for your important accounting software. give others a look first, this online version is lacking what the desktop has.
really frustrating app. very frustrating app both on iphone and qbo. very glitchy and customer support is terrible. if the they didn't force you to use a subscriptionbased model, i'd use the installable version on quickbooks. i'm sure other have less problems, but it has not been a good experience for myself or my company.
very easy to use. works great but doesn't email invoices or estimates
owner. online is getting better with each update still has a few more options i would to able to perform from mobile and laptop being using qbooks for 11 yr
. great app!
not bad. seriously though i wish every program could at least list their password requirements when your login fails i.e capital letters symbols and numbers
quickbooks app. great, convenience of creating, editing and sending invoices and adding customers, payments or expenses
pretty nice. i like quickbooks online, it makes my business run so much easier. there are some glitches here and there, but they seem to catch them and fix them
limited.. with over 700,000 businesses using your software worldwide, i can't fathom how you could possibly find an excuse to release such featurepoor software! 1.) account management is barely sufficient, and doesn't support creating nested accounts; 2.) there's no way to edit photos of receipts that you take with your camera from the expense entry dialog; 3.) no spanish language support; 4.) no item memory, so i have to manually select the account again every time i enter a split; 5.) no offline support. &gt;:(
. love that there is the mileage and receipt tracker now. i was disappointed when there was an entirely separate app and to see these added has made me very happy
fix log in problems. the latest update made logging in extremely difficult. i am no longer able to use my pin or fingerprint even though they are both enabled in the app.
easy to use. easy to learn and use. nice to set up. help is always there if needed.
bad update. last update renders the app useless
. rubbish interface, doesnt send invoices when you press send, had multiple invoices paid late due to this, will be looking for a decent online app to run my business. how can an invoice be overdue if my customer never received it because the app sent it? how do i tell if my estimates have actually been sent? its extremely unprofessional having to contact my customers and ask them if they've recieved invoices and expenses because this software is not up to scratch.
crashes often. this app goes from being usable to worthless on a whim.
crashes. the app just crashes as soon as it starts to load. don't waste your time downloading it.
very intuitive. incredible app. i find it easier to use than the desk top version.
help. the android app is very very slow it takes a long time to change a estimate to a invoice i have emailed support several times about the issue with no reply please speed it up.
. makes things sooo much easier and frees up time! no more sitting in front of a computer all day a couple times a month doing data entrybook keeping. very user friendly app and program. only thing i have to log on to do is mark and sort deposits on the sales end.
nexus 6p problems. still does not work on nexus 6. i'm trying to run a business this app use to make me efficient. now it sucks that i can no longer log in to upload receipts. i would give it zero if i could.
. words cannot express how unfriendly this platform and interface is. both on app and desktop. nothing is plain and simple, switching back to invoice2go as i've been trying to create an estimate for over 6 hrs here and it takes me 5 mins on invoice2go
qb. completely unusable since 6th september update. crashes all the time on latest ios please fix this.
. best app for bussiness by far!
. good but receipt scanning needs to be like the self employed app, if possible. do that and 5 stars for def
great app. 👍🏼
quickbooks slow and hard to work. hard to understand and work. cannot pay on invoices on phone but can on computer. system is slow. give me the old system any day
ceo. this is a really good app it has help our business in so many ways. it help boost our profit margin we have been able to close deals, and make invoices right on the spot. i recommend this for a lot of different business with quickbooks online.
great. not perfect.. very useful program. could use a little bit of polishing though.
. i use this app for 2 separate businesses. is very easy to use and track all of my finances.
must buy two services. i’m selfemployed and need to track miles as well as be able to send estimates. with “quickbooks selfemployed” you can track miles but you cannot send estimates. with “quickbooks online” you can send estimates but you cannot track mileage. to me, these things should be doable with the same serviceapp but here they are not. plus, customer service is not educated on their product or helpful.
. awsme app
waste of time. crashes at least 50% of the time i try to enter an expense while on the go
nice but crashes. i like the app other than the fact that after a few minutes of work it crashes. it reliably crashes. helpfully they fix it soon, it's frustrating to have to log back in every time.
love tracking expenses.. being able to expenses right at the gas pump just makes sense. taking photos of receipts just makes things easier i wish i would've left the desktop app a while ago.
. very user friendly and professional. huge asset to my small business.
. can not change company name it auto put in my email and then the cord company after so is no good to me
. not nearly as useful as the desktop version very weak app. still needs tons of improvement
love this app!. i actually find this easier to use than the desktop version.
easy to access. i use quickbooks online and i love the fact that i can use it on multiple devices with ease. also backups and upgrades are no longer a issue.
. tell me how to cancel the free trial on phone
. great app! easy to use and helps me keep track of our church income and expenses.
nice app..... doesn't function like the website
app is pants. the app was working perfectly until ios10! now opens for .5 second and crashs! how do i run my business accounts on the go!!!! fix needed today!!!
doesn’t work like the app on a pc. the fact that the apps are not the same on a pc than on the ipad or mobile is frustrating. can’t see running totals on the register, can’t add transactions the same way, etc. and the kicker is the website version doesn’t work at all on the ipad, can’t scroll through the register because scroll bars are absent in chrome or safari. horrible adaptation and makes the ipad useless to conduct accounting business with quickbooks...
exelent. nice app
app crashes in ios9. this app was working great before the recent update. app just crashes when i try to open. i use an ipad 3rd gen running the latest version of ios9. please fix!!
great app. great app that does all it promises to do. so handy for getting out quotes when away from the office.
. the quickbooks app has been a life saver! very easy to use and helps when i need to do estimates or invoices on the go.
linked bank account. locked out. no customer service.. there is literally no phone support whatsoever for the mobile app. i'm still locked out of this app after linking my checking account.
changed our business. from the first version of this app with the online version of quickbooks, this has changed our business. no more scribbled notes on sticky paper or back of a student roster. sales are done immediately and nothing is lost or forgotten. my only request is to please add time tracking fit our instructors into the app, then it would be perfect!
getting there.. this app was the absolute worst waste of time when it was launched. but now they are syncing the interface with the browser based app and it's very useful.
. everything i need. just wish they'd include mileage tracking.
i'm underutilizing this app!!. this app is way more capable than the extant than i'm using it for! the best for of the app is on the ipad. the worst form is on my mbp.
. the app works good.....when it works. but it freezes often......and when theres a technical issue it takes 45 days for them to resolve the issue. wasnt what i expected at all from quickbooks.
invoice and estimates not saving after last update. you will have to delete app. then reinstall then it will save.
great mobile app, but it has a mind of its own. i've found the ability to work remotely as a great plus for estimates, electronic invoices and checking customer records. i have just had issues with downloaded deposit amounts and matching for reconciliation. automatic entry into register has to go!
problem fixed!. app works great!
great app. rich in features and great for staying on top of things whilst on the go
. this is a great app, it's easy to used with everything straight foreard
. great app
. like this app! haven't gotten too deep into the functionality
needed this for a while!. this app is great. all of the major needs are right here in your phone. i have inlimited data on my phone so i can log in whenever and check what i need wherever i am.
works great, but has quirks. i love the convienience of being able to access while on the go from my phone or tablet. i came over from using quickbooks 2013 on my desktop so there was a learning curve and you have to get used to the pause between transactions.
like not love, needs work. our company works on the road, and is trying to eliminate paper invoices. the problem is that we can’t get signatures on the invoices if we use quickbooks in the work trucks on the job. this is a big deal because us getting a signature on the invoices can mean the difference between getting paid or not.
. nice app
way to much money for the service don't buy into claims. never is up to date loads so slow a total waist of money.
awesome app! totally enables business on the go!. businesses on the go!
. the best app.
solid app. i can invoice my customer on the way home on the train, and do just about anything else i need.
app not working on iphone. i’ve been trying to install the app on my iphone (6s) with the current version of ios for the past couple of months. the app downloads and installs. when i tap the app to open it, the screen briefly shows the intuit quickbooks logo and then closes. i called support but the told me to go to apple. the ability to use the app to capture receipts etc was a big draw to using quickbooks online. very disappointed.
nice app!. suits my needs...
be careful. when printing invoices from the app it has a tendency to eliminate parts of the billing address. scary.
bookkeeping on the go. i own a small tax and accounting firm and this app has done wonders for customer service! being able to give my clients real time information from anywhere at anytime is a huge plus! i only wish this app would allow me to process ach and credit card payments on the fly!
crash error crash error. quickbooks is a four outta five platform, this app is a one... signs me out and crashes more than once a day!
. it's pretty good but a little clunky on the phone compared to the desktop. and some of the available functions are different which is perplexing to me. at least it's somewhat functional but i i'm still not comfortable doing an estimate on my phone which is sad. billion dollar company and can't get the app right is disappointing. it needs work so that it can flow and function more like the online version.
data sync is not working. managed to get it to work. the sync only work after you pay the subscription. doesn't work during trial period. (there is an error syncing data. error code 132. 100. unable to work with it.) another problem with this mobile app is that it is unable to change the status of the estimates.
. this app keeps getting error loading items, to invoice and estimates can't use it. i call them for support and they have no support they referred me to log in on the web site and the same happens the search button flashes and dispensers. don't waste your time and money. if any one know about a good and reliable app let me know. this one is not reliable nor is their support.
employees?. i can access my payroll and employees online, but not on the app.. am i missing something?
no security with ios 13.0 update.. nice to have the app working again .. too bad it opens without the required password. shoddy update.
. why can't i see bank account details in the app? you can on the ios app contacted help desk who couldn't help! without access to accounts the app is effectively useless. i have done everything you suggest. home screen is now blank! so even worse than when i started. i have also contacted support with no solution as yet.
critical simple feature still missing  for years!. please add the ability to print or download packing slips from the mobile app. everything else can wait till i am back in the office. sometimes a packing slip must be done in a rush. mobile app is useless to me without the packing slip feature.
update needed. for the past three weeks has not been tracking the miles. otherwise a 5 star app when working properly.
i like it. does everything i need mobile. clients, invoices and information...all that i need on the go.
. not bad if all you need is basic access and are happy to ignore or correct inconsistencies in the web interface after. there are a lot of data fields missing in product and customer creation. you can't view or create purchase orders and no data regarding them is included in the activity and dashboard views. not a lot of development and improvement in over a year.
broken app. unusable. app fails to load company data. waited an hour on the phone and never got help. killing my ability to invoice customers while mobile, which is the only reason i chose the online version that i pay for every month! intuit is not intuitive, they're only into your money. zero support. zero answers. zero. the worst.
great app but missing some things. i think this is a great start to the quickbooks app! it is clean looking and well organized. you are able to enter in or download transactions, refer to client information and many other things. my only complaint is that you cannot reconcile any accounts in the app. i would love to be able to reconcile. it would get 5 stars from me if the app could do that.
. trash app. havent been able to sign in for the last 2 months
simplicity and ease. i am new to quickbooks online but absolutely love how simple the app is. it creates time and space in my personal life.
. never could get it to work, after months of paying and a call into quickbooks (who do not support the product if bought through the playstore or apple store), i gave up trying to use this software. $160 out the window with not a single useful action resulting from owning this product.
killer app. killer service.. the app is great, arguably better than the online version. great for keeping track of transactions and uploading photos of receipts.
"send payment receipt function missing. i click ""payment"" to accept money from customer. but it don't have send payment receipt function in my android app, which this function available in browser version."
. great app
. powerful yet easy to implement. i can help my clients set up estimating and billing on the run and remotely update bank recs, etc
slow and buggy. disappointed in app. doesn't correlate well with desktop version. slow to load information and sometimes won't update accounts.
. have had an issue with sending invoices through my app for the last 3 days. even after several calls and emails no one can tell me when this will be rectified. poor support and unorganized for such a large company.
. mostly worthless can't see bank balances or registers.
. very easy and convenient, especially on the go
this app makes billing so much easier, which gives me more time for other tasks.. it is a must have for small business owners, especially new ones.
just what i needed. i run a small contractor business doing remodel work. the mobile app has been a godsend. i can track all my estimates, invoices & expenses in one place. helps me track clients that are late payers too (which sometimes happens). i like it. 100% worth the subscription
. good overall very happy with this app. my only complaint is that my products are not listed by category like they are on the web based version so it makes it difficult to find items when creating invoices or estimates. the mobile site has this feature (but no option to create estimates), so hopefully the app could have it too?
worth the price. i am a small business owner, i was having to write out estimates and bills but since i have this app....... life is way easier!!! now i have more time to do the work and less hassle with the paperwork.
. this has made it so much easier to keep track of our business expenses. i have recommended qbo to all my friends who own there own business.
. needs the employee menu... i like this app and its convenient and all but there's no reason a simple function like the employee menu shouldn't be on it
ahhh. you cant pay employees on the phone or tablet app. its hard to find the login on a normal desktop and when i want to pay an employee the employee section keeps going blank and never loads. this is extremely frustrating!
useless software. quickbooks is slow, has errors and the support is probably the worst i have ever had to use. we had an issue where we could not roster our staff for over a week due to a quickbooks error and every interaction with their support team has been horrible. the api to payroll is slow and buggy and they keep upping the prices. use another service!
works well. app is adequate. performs most functions that i need on the quick. would like more report options. biggest complaint is the need to continuously enter account and password. i have enabled touch id. only about 25% does the app actually use touch id. rest forced to enter password.
beyond useless. i have long been frustrated by intuit's decision to bar users on ipads from accessing any real functionality in quickbooks. i thought this app might address that problem, but it does not. it does not offer anything useful to me.
. easy to navigate
truly mobile accounting apps. i have tried for a few days and it give me an impression that i can finish all my accounting without going back to desktop. it use the camera of phone wisely.
. really good for simple operations i only needed the app for a small subset of operations.... that is, quickly open,edit, and send an invoice. i am thankful for that capability. perhaps intuit could stress that the app is not intended to be full blast qbo.
epic help. this app is very helpful for me it is very good
. love this app!!
. eh. how do i unsubscribe for this
limited functionality, issues signing on, given up.... i have tried to use the app for sometime but find the functionality limited and not sufficient to be practical. in recent weeks i have had an issue switching clients which support has been unable to resolve. i am deleting the app & will use the web version.
what, no zero star option?. great job with touch id and your lousy payroll app. everything this company does is garbage. tells you about the sad state of affairs in financial software if quickbooks is even an option to have to use.
. this app is extremely easy to use and keeps all of my business accounting running smoothly and quickly. i haven't had any problems and neither have any of my customers.
. does not support in india
its great. good program. needs more functionality
. easy to use and very intuitive. great app!
literally crashes every time i try to enter a sale.. great for tracking expenses but useless for processing and tracking sales. very disappointed.
wonderful app!!!. couldn't sing the praises high enough. i run a small, single member managed llc and the quickbooks online app is everything i need. i can create and send invoices and sales receipts on the go, even have the customer sign right on my iphone or ipad.
helpful but needs better search options. cannot search by customer address, you can only search by customer name. automatically fills in service date which can lead to mistakes.
we are using this with the construction side of our business and so far the customer service has been wonderful. there are things missing or not working but customer service had said they are working on getting them added or fixed. makes it really easy for our employees in the field to create invoices and send them to clients as well as receive payments. will change to five stars when missing components are added.
freezes. freezes when saving a new client. app is useless.
. worst customer service ever they do the exact opposite of customer service, whatever it would be the answer will always be no, we can't, we won't, it's the policy
really wish it was hipaa compliant. i have a healthcare related company. my billing process would be a lot easier and faster if i could send invoices through my secure network or if qbo was hipaa compliant.
. my only dislike is that on android it will only being up the last year of data... where on my daughter's apple it brings up all data from many years ago
can't find internet?. every time i try to log in i get an error message that there is no internet to connect to which is bull. it's on my cell phone so there's wifi and data. very disappointed.
yes please. great program, easy to use. perfect for startups!
release ios 13 update now. i pay way too much money, and it’s going up in october, for you not to have an update day one ios 13 is released. you guys are always behind with the bugs. i cant even click on a customer, save an invoice, send an email etc. give me what i’m paying for.
. really. trying to do work here and you are forcing an update. no time for this bs
not reliable. is not reliable. not a replacement for desktop app or web based qb online. different icons, different navigation, missing tools reports and features. data does not reliably import into app from accounts.
can’t use it in iphone or ipad! keep getting error.. i keep getting an error! queryprocessingerror:null
love online access. i love that i can access from anywhere. i like the desktop version better than the online version, but still a good program for a small business.
. easy access to receipt and monitoring funds made and spent
. utter garbage. i use the online version daily, but the app barely functions, is laid out differently, and doesn't have any of the major features that i use online on a regular basis.
can’t attach existing photo with ios13. with ios 13 you cannot upload an existing photo to a new expense. when you select a photo, the app freezes and there’s no button to accept the photo.
how did i run my business without it?. i do half my estimates and invoices on the go with this app. saves me so much time!
book keeping made easy. with constant updates this is the go to program for my business! this app assists in daily activity and allows me to be on the move.
. love it!!! works great with the online site, as a business owner this app is very useful.
they ruined this product. run, don't walk, away from this app. the idiots at intuit have destroyed all utility in it.
"it doesn't synchronize. the app is totally unusable. it doesn't synchronize customers and supplier and the transaction with those missing from the list result as incomplete. tried also to dis install and reinstall: same story. on top of this it must also said that the assistance is unresponsive, many days and repeated enquiries to finally get emails full of irritating smileys and useless answers like ""we are constantly improving the apps to serve our mobile customers""."
very helpful. this ap has been great with my ipad! being able to enter receipts and attach a photo right from the camera is the best! i love having the ease of bookkeeping on a smaller device that i can take with me everywhere.
. great app
the best. would have a hard time keeping up with everything without this program. works great!
. good user friendly
love it. i love this app, just doing what i want
so easy to use!. such an easy app to use, these guys have simplified bookkeeping down from something i wouldn't dare touch, to being able to raise invoices from my phone and connect my bank accounts, no hassles at all.
quickbooks. excellent software, app is realy handy tool
. decent needs expenses like gas and food. also the ability to enter bank deposits and batch them together. this is a great app for invoicing and recording accepting a payment from a customer, that is the extent of it though.
easy and convenient. i own a construction business, and have grown very fond of this app. it's really convenient to use the app to maintain our books on the go. my husband and i wear many hats in our business. our time is precious, but quickbooks online helps free up some of that time with its ease of use.
. whats the cost after free trial
new business.. very user friendly. almost like apple designed it. very unhappy that the email function doesn’t work. many people have complained for over a year and quickbooks still hasn’t offered a fix😠. i have to take a screenshot and copy and paste to my email. not as professional looking, but gets the job done. that one glitch took away two stars because i can’t use my mobile phone to give someone an invoice or estimate.
love the desktop version. the app needs work.. limited functionality. i can't even update the credit card i use to pay quickbooks in the app. tough to send invoices to clients
the best business app ever!. i have been in business for nine years and have been using quickbooks desktop. i am now using the online and it is great so happy that i made the switch. works well with ipad and can do my work right on the site! thanks for the great work! ray's home improvement,llc
. as stated on my previous review,, i have tried every method including the ones quickbooks suggest and i still cannot find an unsubscribe button anywhere, this is very frustrating and ironic in the fact this app is ment to save you time, i spent half a day trying to unsubscribe to this with still no joy , last result to phone the number which does not work over a weekend.
great app. very good app to manage quickbooks when you are away from your desk.
not trustworthy. quickbooks has some issues with taking multiple accounts under the same email. i can not access my account because my email was used to open a second trial and i can not access my data any longer. choose better accounting software, overall. this app has no visible way to logout or troubleshoot.
. doesn't let me connect a bank account
. doesnt download data keeps stuck at the download screen. was told to send an email to john_quickbooks@gmail.com and have not heard back from that address. how do they not have an @quickbooksonline.com support email for this stuff?
"was great until recently. this used to be a great app until a few weeks ago. now, every morning when we go to open the app it states ""downloading company data"" and does this for hours. we have customers needing to get estimates, pay invoices, etc., but can't because we can't use the app! this just recently started happening. qb can you please fix this issue??? this type of problem shouldn't go on for this long!"
great softwsre. multiple devices awesome
invoices and estimates design. the design and layout of the invoices and estimates templates are outdated. seems like a small thing, but it reflects poorly on a business’ brand, and it is so easily fixed on your end. hire a professional designer and give clients a template that says quickbooks cares about our brand too.
. not support in india
qbo ipad & iphone. i think that intuit is doing an incredible job with this product! the updates have been wonderful for me. it would be 5 stars if i could make bank deposits as well! i've upgraded to 5 stars since i can now do deposits as well. is bank transfer in the future?
finally. there has been a massive weight of my business and shoulders thanks to this software. the ease,simplicity and on the spot actions you can do with this make it truly one of a kind.
needs to fix bugs. i love quickbooks online and the desktop version but their mobile app needs to fix their bugs. i told quickbooks support two months ago that i couldn't email an invoice from the app and they couldn't help me fix the problem then. i still cannot send invoices from my mobile app so it is basically useless to me.
trouble with ipad app. hello, i have the app in my iphone and it works great, but i have downloaded the app in the ipad and it tells me: looks like your account doesn’t include access to the quickbooks online mobile app... what i need to do to have access?. please advice! thanks
expenses tab stopped working. please fix the expenses tab. it's greyed out on this version and i can't use it.
difficulty. bad program because of the difficulty in the secret code i offer to delete the program and i do not want to waste my time in it if the secret code is difficult
easy enough to use, works best with the online version. i'm only using this for the basics of bookkeeping, so it's enough for me. the functions in the app is different than the online version, so i mainly use it to take pictures of invoices. i enter an invoice online, then snap a picture of the invoice using the app. i also use the app to quickly get a monthly total per supplier, which the online version doesn't have.
everything i need right from my phone. so handy to be able to do estimates, invoices, and record my expenses right from my phone! will save a lot of time with bookkeeping as now i can enter everything on the go.
. great program for keeping track of your expenses and income.
. thanks for making our financial records tracking make easier. software is amazing. suggestion: please add purchase order in mobile app.
. brilliant app, very easy to use even for beginners. also has great customer support for your problems and queries.
. it's better easier than what they made the desk top version into.
this app needs updated. this version won't work :(. not working reloaded app no go. :(
app ruined. this is getting old. the app seems to be unusable every time an update heads out way. my invoices are showing old data, are not updating to show payments and do not match what is correctly shown in the real online desktop service. please fix , and stop updating prior to testing
. i would like to be able to invoice from the app.... but other than that, i love it.
why do you need so many permissions?!. why the hell would quickbooks need to use my microphone, contacts, wifi, camera, location, calender etc etc. if these are features, let us turn them on inapp rather than forcing us to let you profile us and sell our data
great app. works well for small to medium size businesses on the go!
. i can't delete my account! i installed the app, and create profile, but it seems that there is no way you can't delete your account or ask quick book to forget your info, i'm afraid i shared my info.
major flaw. the app ui is pretty good and i really like the interface. the problem is that a lot of my invoices are not even viewable on the app. basically anything that has a delayed charge on it won't show up so there is a major glitch there or something.
can’t subscribe after trial period. it’s a good quickbooks version but i started trial period made a profile and invoices but the app won’t let me renew subscription the buy now button doesn’t work when clicked on. now i may have to start another profile and lose everything?
not industry standard software. this is a clunky, disappointing, entry level piece of work. qb has been available for many years and i cannot believe that, having been recommended to download by our accountant, it feel like it has barely reached beta testing level. a real pity that microsoft money is no longer supported. that’s how to put a piece of software together. i have littleno confidence in the product.
poor design. very hard to navigate and understand. customer service only works bankers hours and not when you need them.
great app, easy to use. love being able to manage my business on the go. could use more features, but it's still a great app and quickbooks is always updating it. :)
". the app failed to associate my quickbooks online account with the app at login. ""it seems like you have an account with intuit but no quickbooks online company associated with : my@email would you like to create a company?"" additionally, when trying to troubleshoot this issue, i was given the run around through all services... from faqs, to online support, to calling directly. issue still unresolved."
limited compared to quickbooks desktop. quickbooks online is just ok. it has some limits that did not exist in the desktop version. a lot of them have to do with assisted payroll. for example, the app does not tell you each pay period how much of a contribution to pay towards simple ira's and give you a chance to indicate whether they were paid. it just assumes it was done without giving you any notice. other limitations make it just ok.
needs improvement. i love the desktop version but my app version and even the online version never works right! there is always something that doesn't work. i always go through the whole estimate or invoice and then it won't save it for me! very frustrating and i wish they could work out all of the kinks.
security update  unable to sign in. since the security update for sign in features i'm unable to sign into my account using the app.. defeats the purpose of having it aug 23, 2016  just redownloaded the app and have full access once again. oct 20, 2016  unable to select cash, check or credit account to pay an expense.
ran into unsupported transactions within 1 minute.. the app is difficult to navigate, bloated and slow, using a ton of wireless data. the app would be much better as multiple singlefunction apps. i mean, do i really need to log in to qb to snap a pic of a receipt and submit it for later? typical quickbooks bad experience. very disappointing.
unable to signin🙅. moto g turbo : error says i don't have online subscription,reported via email, no response😡
great. amazing app but whoever did that last update screw it all up. can save estimate or invoices. horrible. i hope they refund at least a month of fees because i'm loosing money having to do all my estimatesinvoices at my house instead. needs to be fixed asap.
owner. quickbooks has !ade it simple to take care of my business. thank you
not that great. was pretty good before the last update. new update is terrible, would be happy to speak with the suits upstairs. unable to fix this. makes it very frustrating. please fix this, straight away.
. beware anyone cis don't use this use xero being mainly a cis contractor it won't let me make invoices in app so have to use browser which doesn't work so have to wait till i get home to invoice from laptop. i'm stuck till end of tax year then i'm off
does not work. cannot trust any invoices under clients or vendorsall are bad. only thing it can be used for is to take a photo of a receipt and add it to a vendors account. can make up an estimate in the field otherwise it is terrible
terrible app. this app is not even close to what you expect it does not do what your quick books does. there is no way to change product descriptions without having to rewrite the whole item. it does not link to quick books in trial mode and not sure if i want to pay for this service. bottom line this is not what you would expect i think they are still working the bugs out buy some other app.
. very easy to use on a mobile. means i can invoice on the go
great accounting app. i've been using the quickbooks app for a over a year now and i love how it allows me to stay on top of my business accounting. i love that the app allows me to take a snapshot of my receipts and link them to their corresponding expense transactions within quickbooks.
. how to manage inventory ? i need to know the state of my stock, ie item, quantity, cost etc as the sales goes on how to do that ???
awesome app. i run a small business and i use quick books to manage my entire business! from estimates to invoices to getting paid its all so easy and fun to use! thanks guys
. i have been learning a lot about quick books. it's helpful to my company. i keep up on my invoice do date's, and spending.
love it. makes life so much easier
. works good for me in the field! i am grateful to have this free mobile app.
great app. qb online app is a great app and it's only getting better. it frees up alot of time to be able to run a business on the go.
so easy to use. i've been using quickbooks for just over a year now and i'm still finding new ways of working, making my life easier! thank you
. really hard to un subscribe , cheep get what you pay for ...
i'll join the others above  very disappointing. i really wanted qbo for my ipad, not a couple of utility features. why release this and just frustrate us more. if you can'twon't produce what we want at least let us access the website qbo on our ipads,
small electrical business. this software is perfect for anyone starting a business. it keeps everything organized from billing to customer records.
love it, but needs some work. reeeallly wish i could cut a po on the app. other than that, the app is a great tool
very good app. good functionality. still room for improvement in some areas but i know they will come in time. love quickbooks online!
handy app. useful when adding info onsite. can be a little confusing to tell if the data you are working on is current, or needs refreshing.
crash. latest update causes app to crash on loading.
cis unfriendly. useless if your a contractor or subcontractor. if your in the construction industry, this app is useless. you cannot create cis invoices which renders this app useless.
quickbooks online. does everything i need without problems.
. every invoice i have done since the beginning of 2017 says 90 plus days past due
wow!. such an easy app to use as a new business owner and entrepreneur this really helps keep track of tax purposes and client sales!
great, but can learn from others. just my observations: mobile app should be mostly used to record expenses. it lacks ocr tracing. moreover scanning a receipt is a multistep process. should add forcetouch to add receipt (open in camera). invoices: been searching how to add my banking information. cannot believe quickbooks does not allow for adding banking information to invoices. did i miss something? or is it a hidden feature? not very intuitive (pun intended). otherwise good. like the integration with bank account.
. great little accounts app for a reasonable price.
all but useless. response time simply toooooo slow. customer would have to wait 5 mins for data.
horrible. crashes every time. horrible customer service. move on to another app.
stop downloading.. i have redone load company data every time i log on the app which can take hours, and essentially makes the apps convenience useless.
. really nice accounting app. loads of integrations via desktop browser. even a desk top app that i suspect is node based. the best feature which is lacking in other accounting apps is transaction memos. that £200 i lent my mate in july is useful info when you look back a year later.
. error message when i try to log in on my tablet. customer service offers little assistance after a long time on hold. this experience makes accounting for my small business even more unbearable. (update 11418): i dropped the review down to one star (from 2) because the error message is yet to be resolved on my tablet, three months later, and qb has increased the cost of their simple start plan by 30%. lame.
crashing. since moving to iphone11 pro  the app keeps crashing. can’t even access it! please fix this as i have to upload receipts to my laptop to add to quickbooks! ain’t nobody got time for that........
qb online improved cash flow  piano studio. i own a busy piano studio and quickbooks online changed my business from the first month using it. clients are 98% on time paying now, versus a 40% late rate prior when i invoiced on paper. my invoices are easy to send out and create quick reminders. they look professional, too!
nogo on ipad pro. doesn't look good on ipad pro and doesn't support split screen. need to be able to have qb open on one side and my project system on the other to create invoices.
. i love the simple features on the app.
. xcelent.
functional and practical. love the cloud software, love the app.
. i was so scared of handling my businesses finances before this app. between the ease of use of the app, and all of the handy tutorials and videos on youtube from them i actually feel like i know what i'm doing
. worst customer service ever! they blocked my customer payment and i couldn't get any answer after two weeks and nobody is responsible. update: it's been seven days that i sent them an email regarding the issue but still no response! even nobody has an answer to my problem! it's not more than just a show off that they care about their customers! everything is normal with this company unless anything happens, and you need customer service, then you feel what i'm saying!
great app... needs some work.. there’s no way to record a sale without attaching a customer to it. also, there’s really not a place in the app to keep a ledger. if it had these 2 things, it would get 5 stars from me, but as it stands i give it 4.
great app for the ipad. great app for the ipad and small buisness
. love being able to work in quickbooks from my phone! one of the best features is being able to take a picture of your receipt and attach it to your expenses right from your phone. makes your bookkeeping incredibly easy! wonderful customer service, love the payroll, too many good things to say about this app.!
useful but slow. quickbooks online in general is useful for sending out invoices and estimates on the go, going through expenses, etc... however the platform can be fairly slow and sometimes glitchy.
missing function. we need a mileage tracking function in this app, not only to selfemployed version, to integrate all the expenses within quickbooks.
. great app ok
adding a photo to a receipt should be simple. apparently there was a recent update that removed the add photo option to tranasactions. it's not there any longer. i called support and they tell me i have to create a note, add the photo to that note, then go find the transaction and add the note to it.
. great app
. grat app now with the new version and updates this is the best app for contractors like myself that are always in the field.
"too many free apps for me to pay for this service!!. if they are a ""top developer"" then make a free version with limited functionality for basic users like myself and a full subscription app for small business owners like your competitors do."
doesn't sync. app doesn't sync with qb, banking features (adding expenses, vendors) also doesn't sync with online site.
great as an on the go app. we find the app ideal used as a reference for clients address contact details, quick invoicing whilst on site and a generally speedy server. works for us using the desktop as the main hub.
love the videos  love the whole system. easy, intuitive, and so rich with features.
fix the bugs. this program has many bugs and has connectivity issues. the level of problems with the software is extensive. when the program works correctly it works nicely, but the downtime and glitches greatly degrade the value of this software. i would look for an alternative accounting software package. i do not know anyone who has used this software that would give it a five star rating. in other words, i am very skeptical of the rating shown.
. so far so good. i like the way the mobile app compliment the online version. great tool.
. this app is great. i can do everything from my phone. i'm can update at any moment and keep an eye on clients who are running late on payments.
excellent once setup. i run my whole business on quickbooks. it was a little tricky to set up initially but once my bookkeeper had given it the once over, everything was perfect. great stock management system that ties in to the invoices and hooks in with the business bank account. this makes self assessments etc very easy and saves loads of time. very happy :)
quickbooks online. efficient, easy to use, paperless. i love it! i had some help with set up from erin walsh, of quickbooksrx, and my new practice was ready to go in one day. i love the way the related apps, such as gopayment, work seamlessly together and that i can track from my phone, tablet or computer.
time tracking missing from app. i bill services by the hour and pay extra for the version of quickbooks that supports time tracking. was very disappointed to see this feature completely missing from the app. it’s such an obvious thing to have on the go. now i need to have a totally separate system to track time...
new to qb app. love it
does not register. i like the pictures and comments but cant see for myself coz it doesn't accept any of my numbers when creating a account so i didn't even register. somone pls help
qb online. does everything i need and more!
locks up. cannot load company data. does not work since app update.
love it. it is a great app
great set up. makes my life way easier!!
. full featured app! quickbooks makes it easy to stay organized. this full featured app brings the desktop to you. easy to make invoices on the go.
. the app is really handy when adding expenses. easy to navigate.
. great app. please keep your prices reasonable.
switching between account requires logout and login. so annoying, especially since there is no support for touch id. why can't you let us switch from within the app?
. i've downloaded this app, uninstalled it, and reinstalled it and it will not allow me to create an account. it continually signs me out and i have to reenter all my information. i'm giving up!
excellent. this app is making a huge difference to our business management. real time visibility of important financial data! to improve, id love visibility of scheduled bills, plus ability to make part payments to invoices. terrific!
"good app. quickbooks is just about perfect for my small business, one addition i would like is to be able to easily see a ""spend per customer"" button so i can easily add up the amount any repeat customer spend per yearmonth."
highly recommend!. very useful when you're on the go and need to update and categorize for your accountant! better than their website.
needs timesheet support. price went up 100 a year and still no timesheet support outside of desktop app
export. does everything i need it to do but can't export your data on a mac. also crashes in ios 11 beta but not holding that against them since i'm using beta version of ios. works find on my phone using ios 10
did you not test the latest update?. crashes on startup... please fix asap. i use this daily. this used to work great.
what happened to this app??. the quickbooks app used to be a 5 star, user friendly, reliably functional app. since december this app has had issues with freezing, crashing, randomly logging the user out and overall has ran extremely slow. i’ve noticed this on the app for mac as well. while trying to run a business, it would be really nice to have a working invoice and bookkeeping app. please fix this
love quickbooks. we have a small business and quickbooks is so simple and straightforward to use, it saves us so much time, and i can write and send invoices straight from my phone! love it.
. great app, does what it says.
flawless. first app that i've used that really hasn't had any problems at all. i do most on my computer but this is nice to have in case you're in a jam
unable to download. it keep saying you already own this app so it will download, but nothing happens
. so far it is superb
. can't edit products without losing the changes. can't edit purchases. overall, still very buggy and slow. had to buy a windows 10 tablet to get it to work. kindly update your android apps. very unproductive to use. will be migrating out. useless for people on the go. slow data sync. when not working, still need use a laptop.
stuff always wrong or glitchy. seems every time i turn on quickbooks by pc or mobile app, something doesn't work! never buy online version, it sucks
. the app has been very glitchy lately, and i haven't been able to sign in for the past week. most of my business is on the road. its becoming very inconvenient.
a j rooter. it's an easy program to use makes life a lot less aggravating when you can do your work on the road
great!. i've used quickbooks for years. very happy with the online. version, it allows me to take care of my invoicing anytime anywhere. my business is more profitable now because i can send an invoice when the job is complete and there's no forgetting to do it at the end of the day. if your business is mobile shouldn't your accounting be also?
don’t ever sign up for subscription services. i signed up for this and forgot my login credentials. it was a pain to figure out how to cancel it.
very nice app. very easy to use and make my all estimates and invoices very smooth and keep the updates very soon
. very handy
. easier to send invoices via the app than it is on the computer. only flaw is i can't enter a negative number for discounts but that could just be my phone and not the app. overall i highly recommend it for anyone.
wonderful app.. wonderful app. makes my life so much easier. wish i would have signed up with qbo earlier.
problem. please update the quick book we are not able use from india..
easy and efficient!. the app serves perfectly to capture transactions on the go, snap a pic and enter amount and accounts then review later if needed on a computer. simple, some people expect this to be fully functional for some reason; if you need a fully functional program then you really should have the appropriate expenses towards computers and software anyways. this app makes the book keeping process easy as cake for clients and the accountant.
. so easy to use on mobile. do the work, invoice it, and get paid
qbo for mobile is fantastic!!!. i love being able to invoice a client on the go with my mobile phone. so convenient.
quickbooks  issues and problems. i thought this may be reputable like the brand. boy am i surprised. can't even call to get proper support. they think that a 48 hours turnaround on a request is acceptable these days...for your important accounting software. give others a look first, this online version is lacking what the desktop has.
. i can't receive payment directly to my bank account. somehow it goes to undeposited funds even if a choose cheque or direct debit.
. i couldn't connect my bank account to even try the application. despite all the reviews i read about the connection issue, i tried anyway. my stupid mistake and i paid for the first month...ugh. you have to do way more work to get the refund than it takes for them to take your money. i'm sure it would have been helpful, if it worked properly. qbo, you guys really need to fix that
um yeeaaa.... it’s kind of crappy i can’t link my bank accounts with out manually entering the transaction it kinda takes the quick out of quickbooks
. can't connect my bank account. please fix this error. i have to manually put my expenses in the app because when i try connecting my bank account i always get a pop up saying an error occurred.
great app. this app makes keeping up with everything so simple!
no back up provision.. i just want my books to work. can't upload anything. no way to make inquiries
nice app. its very useful application.
. quickbooks notified me of this update at 1am. not nice.
amazing. this is so much easier to use and access. we are out in the field more time than at the office and to be able to email am invoice to a customer in front of him is awesome.
mario osorio painting and a&t housecleaning. love this program very friendly and very easy to understand for my self and my bookkeeper.
can not even create account. i am from indonesia. please create apps that apply internationally
makes life easier. does everything i need! only 1 suggest...i want to sort quotes by date created...
. the app does awesome it keeps me organized and constantly lets me know what i'm spending my money on. it has helped me better manage my money
. great program! time saving system. wish i had estimate vs actual report.
. error code 132.100 quickbooks doesnt even have a fix for it. customer service has no clue as to what they are doing. i like paying for software that i can't use
. i have contacted customer service several times for support issues with the appquickbooks online not syncing the transactions automatically. no one seems to have an answer on what's going on. each time i'm advised by a customer service represenative to remove and reconnect the bank account yet in doing so it still doesn't work.
. good app, making it easier for me to work on the road.
does not work. app does not work. wish it did, but it does not. none of my vendor activity shows up, profit and loss does not scroll past first page. better no app at all than one that does not work.
can't save an invoice since update.. please fix asap. i use to use this app everyday and now i can't. i love quickbooks but this is bad!!
. very good software up to date
new and improved. i waited a long time to change over to the online version per the advice of my accountant. it was worth the wait. it's a much better version and easier than the regular version of qb
awesome. love it , great app.
. this app works sometimes and then not at all. i log in and there is no icons to search customers or anything at all. please help!
amazing app for a small or medium business. very user friendly. don't have to be an account to enter data, app allows you to do everything on the go.
. unfortunately it crashes when i log in on my samsung tab a
productive. one app that is recommended for everyone. it helps you become your own ca and with no knowledge one can start and keep everything on tips.
needs work. glitches, freezes all the time, constant updates asks me to review app while i'm using app so annoying
. consistent app
bug. current iphone version doesn’t let me enter expenses. every time i try, i get an “error: please choose a template before saving.” huh?
. clunky, ugly app with barely any features. there's no way to refresh your banking data within the app, though navigation and ux is so awful i maybe just can't find it. no consistent design standard throughout with multiple different menu types, navigation styles, presentation. almost no graphics, just pages of text. invoicing, expenses and tracking are all so horrible i'm forced to use the (also underwhelming) browser version. edit: the developers comment below doesn't work as of 130619
great. i wish i would have used qb a lot sooner. life would have been much easier.
ios 13 crashing. app crashing after password screen , ios 13 is not compatible with this app at present , considering the amount my company pays for quickbooks i’m disappointed to say the least .
. great app, but i wish i could generate purchase orders from the app to send to vendors.
. we love quickbooks! it helps you to stay organized and keep track of your income and expenses so when tax season comes you have it all ready. we have found it very useful!
. great app, easy to use....
what a waste. after trying for over an hour to get pass login , it tells me that i don’t have any services. wasted my time. i’ll just use the android version.
app barely compatible with computer. the the features on the app and computer barely cross over and i can never find customers on the app that i have on my computer so i have to jump back and forth to make things work.
. everytime need to key pass word. finger print funtion no use for full screen mobile phone. not user friendly enough
invoicing. i use quickbooks as a means to invoice customers and collect deposit for jobs. for me it's worth it. it would be great if you could get a notification that the customer has decided to pay by credit card should you need to adjust your estimate.
purchase orders. why are there no purchase orders in the app? surely you should have same main capabilities as using full system.
dreadful just unusable plus desktop version same. started well. then couldn’t input expenses on the app. hard and long winded to get support. now cant enter invoices and reciepts on desktop version!! totally pointless package and when you have r pugh troubles running your own business!!!!! think i will go back to my accountant and just dump everything with him each month as the hours this is costing me plus unbelievable stress!!!!
. square app is so much easier to navigate on mobile app. plus square has instant deposit. quick books i have to wait 2 buisness days at the least. horrible.
fees?. i paid over $300 for the qb pc program. i wish they had something basic for free.
awesome!. it has helped me to collect unpaid invoices more efficiently and i've collected more money because unpaid invoices are not forgotten about until they have been paid.
excellent. excellent software worth every penny
don’t update to ios 13 if you want this to work. there a so many bugs with this app now that ios version 13 has been released. you can’t even enter an expense now without an error popping up that you need to create a template. quickbooks online support has been no help. they advised i use the browser on my phone. what’s the point of the app then? test test test folks.
garbage. i still can't login since last updated. it's been a freaking month
excellent app. great app
needs a couple of things. 1. better interface 2. main app screen should be like the desktop and show your account summary. but overall very good :)
. great experience. easy way to keep your business organized.
. great app gets the job done on the go tied it and liked it!
. does everything i want it to
not working properly after update. people have businesses to run!! i understand glitches from freecheap apps. not something that costs $360year. why did you replace the pin with passcode? i don’t want to log into my iphone, ever. all i need secured is my qb app and the pin worked just fine for that. with this update i can login successfully once every 2030 attempts. intuit, test your updates before you release them!!!
easy to use. look, read a lot of the reviews and people are expecting their own accountant with this program. it does what is needed to keep your finances in order. if you want 4 ,ill ion graphs to impress and be bigger then you are....go hire a team. great product, easy to use, tracks everything for me, keep my books straight, and recommend it to everyone.
easy to use. really like the app because i can keep up with accounting on the go for my business.
. does not work with marshmallow 6.0
great app. helps me stay on top of my business while away from the office and quickly send and receive invoices. love this app!
very good app. excellent app
good app. this app and software can help you track y control all your business data, in one and easy way!
makes books much easier to keep updated. this is a powerful combination of mobile, camera, and bookkeeping. much easier than relying on the desktop.
do not use to run payments through. i ran two payments with them the first they held up because routing number issues and the second because my bank account was not financially available or what ever to run transactions what kind of s**t is that now they want me to refund $2100. to customer on the card after car has left 4 days later and i have to figure out how im going to get my money . horrible !!!!!!
great but.......... i want to not be bothered with pop ups asking me to rate the app. this is a tool to use for business. i don’t want ads and pop ups continually having to be closed in order to work
. great tool for our business. definitely makes life easier!
pretty lame. seriously? the thing crashes a lot , but i can deal with that. the real problem for me is the lack of calendar in the invoice line item. i would love to use this, but if i can't put the date that i provided a service in my invoice, the it is useless to me. too bad safari doesn't work either, or i would just use that.
. this app coupled with the web based app is the best thing i have seen for small business. cut book work down to an hour a night rather than 3. the ability to send both quotes and invoices on the go saves hours. works extremely well with the paid web app happy as with both
great app!. i love this app for the ease of use for my clients and me.
. very happy with the product and services, everything in one place
. great software
. needs something fix sales tax to enable for existing customers!
one in all. i can run my business with great confidence because of this application available of quickbooks online. one my favorite functions is the capability of producing estimates, and invoices immediately. that function pleases a majority of my professional field clients.
item searching is harder then it should be when creating an invoice or estimate. wish there was a search bar that filters through my sales items easier. i should just type in a few letters and all the related items with those letter should pop up
great app. this is getting better with each update it makes. i you this app everyday to run my practice and it makes it very convenient because i'm constantly on the road and i don't have to sit at my desk just to enter expenses or send invoices to clients.
should be able to snap a pic of a receipt and sort later.. i need to be able to take a picture of my receipts and then when i do the books sort them out and match them to purchases.
unstable bank syncing with capital one spark business. selling a functionality that isn’t ready for market... product is way too beta. needs more robust customization features for price of qbo, and portability across other qb versions, ie desktop, mac, etc.
quick books. this is very easy to use and it's great. with my iphone, ipad and mac, it updates any changes made and works great. thanks it is made invoicing easy
. keeps stopping mileage tracking, gives me message about battery optimisation....... now my phone is on 247 so unless the fairies are messing with my phone when i'm asleep there is a problem! getting answers from qb is nigh on impossible!
excellent companion to your quickbooks online subscription.. i rated this app lower than 5 stars when i first reviewed it. purely because it showed my invoices in usd and not gbp. unfortunately there was no way to change it once set. recently i had to completely reset my phone. this gave me the opportunity to install the app fresh. this time it picked up my local currency correctly. so, 5stars from me now.
glitches. app has lots of glitches. try to create an invoice and it was not working. quickbooks has been awesome up to this point. i run my whole business through quickbooks in this new update has been a disappointment. should've left it alone!
very satisfied!. been using the mobile app for the past 2 months now, and i can say it does everything i need. very easy to issue invoices, receive the money, match, reconcile the bank, calculate the vat! the support people are very helpful and have a lot of patience!
horrible mobile support!. this app has a ton of problems and nobody at intuit cares to fix it. app won't load half the time, invoices do not show up, errors all the time, signature capture doesn't work, and no support available for the mobile app. the only thing they know is to tell you to uninstall and reinstall it which fixes nothing! if they don't get their issues fixed, i am switching!
excellent. great mobile app from intuit, quickbooks online is great and although a bit different from the desktop version it has improved the way i work with my clients
. does it need an internet connection?
. brilliant app, very easy to use even for beginners. also has great customer support for your problems and queries.
. love the app! it makes my job so much easier!
much room for improvement. if it were free, it's a great product , but as a paid program and app, it could use a good deal of user input towards improvement
intuit keeps working it but stumbles on occasion. i've been a qbo user for over 4 years now and run my whole oneman business on it. each app version is a bit better than the last and they do fix bugs when notified. i continue to be happy to see intuit continue to improve the app and the web interface. the blanking of bank account data in the dashboard appears to be fixed in v5.3.
. this app is slow
nightmare to delete account. costs per month!
finally!. this app does all that i've wanted  expenses and all. good to se qbo is working at this. love the mobile experience.
. this app works sometimes and then not at all. i log in and there is no icons to search customers or anything at all. please help!
. superb app
limited for multi user. i wanted to be able to have a an app that i could send with my field employees. this one does not allow more than gross limits on data.
attach photos. it would be nice to attach photos with emailed invoices, and a record of when invoices are sent to customers.
useless. i'm not even sure what the point of this app is. there's absolutely nothing you can do with it besides see what what you've already done on your desktop. the app does nothing to help you keep things moving along.
it just made my business easy. thanks qb and my brother mohit. a very good app for every startup and and firm.
. its perfect for a small or big buisness. the quickbook invoicing is programed so user friendly its incredible how fast i can do an estimate, load all my documents, upload pictures, email directly to your customer and have them sign the screen right on your cell phone. not to mention its doing your bookkeeping at the same time. i absolutely love it!
. great experience
easy to use. a simple easy app that keeps everything in one place
pathetic on ipad. i don’t know why intuit bother to have an ipad app. it never works, has less functionality than a browser. the latest update tells you your account doesnt exist, the exact same log in as a browser. someone in the development department is being paid far too much for a substandard product. avoid the app like the plague
best ap and program for home business. i trailed several other programs before quickbooks. it allows me to split an expense between personal and business which others wouldn't. the ap is easy to use and love that i can take a photo of the receipt. no more loosing receiptshaving them fade etc.
buggy app. doesn’t even open, tried many times opening it on my iphone x for weeks. it doesn’t even open the app and there hasn’t been an update to fix that for ages. unable to use it on my phone and having to use it on my laptop which i don’t always have it on hand. please fix this issue.
crashed when entered a sales transaction. downloaded this app to see if i could use it instead of at a computer and the app crashed as soon as i tried to enter a sales transaction. i tried to enter in the receipt type and it crashed
useless. my boss uses qb to track my hours. as far as i can tell, i can't make those changes on this app. that makes this app totally useless to me.
. the previous version didnt update dashboard. this latest version does not run on my samsung s9 at all. quits with an error after signing in. i have uninstalled, reinstalled, still won't work.
ios 13 problems. quickbooks is normally pretty good, the online version is fantastic. unfortunately the app no longer works on ios13, i will come back once the app has been updated and revise my review.
terrible. glitchy. doesn't update new transactions. hard to navigate compared to desktop qbo app. honestly, intuit knows it can do better than this. they're just greedy.
no way to categorize transactions. no way to access bankcredit card accounts to categorize transactions. what's the point of having the profitloss tab if that's the case??
ipad trouble. i’ve been using the self employed app for almost two years. i had some issues with crossover between a new mac and my iphone. though a painful process, tech support eventually fixed it. now after downloading the app on ipad, the app won’t work on the ipad. says mobile access isn’t available. well what have i been doing on my phone for two years then?
just no. the app isnt compatible with the galaxy s7 which is really inconvenient. 👎👎👎.
love it. so easy to use and fantastic customer support for those of us who are not good at this kind of thing, would highly recommend quickbooks for all small businesses, we love that being online we can have it on all our devices and have what ever we need on hand all the time, no more leaving quotes at home! invoicing on the run is great too.
. great app.
. really, no way to tell a bank account to go get updates? i wasted my time downloading and using this app.
it's ok not super. i'd like to have the ability to creat checklists and forms that aren't effectively invoice like. i also don't like intuit screwing with their databases and allowing some invoices and expenses to go missing from my account.
great program. i use quickbooks on a daily basis, would recommend to any small business.
cpa. i love this app! i can take care if my client s with my smartphone.
very satisfied!. been using the mobile app for the past 2 months now, and i can say it does everything i need. very easy to issue invoices, receive the money, match, reconcile the bank, calculate the vat! the support people are very helpful and have a lot of patience!
no employee section. this app contains nothing to help your employees, only the business manager. quick books could’ve at least added support for timesheets and such since they no longer allow you to save your timesheet in mobile browsers.
fantastic application. i love this app. it let's me manage my expenses and easily invoice on the go. great tool!
. statement option is not given in app.
phillip of cgc. great app
excellent app. helpful reports and nice review of recent transactions to make sure operations are in tact.
. great smb accounting software. use it for my company and have had no issues at all. customer support is responsive as well.
easy to use, even for a newbie!. great app. easy to use, even for someone with little accounting knowledge.
. excellent app makes having a small business so simple
. best accounting app.
. malfunctions on every level. did not attach a single receipt picture to the transaction. brought in the bank accounts and scrambled them. even on the desktop deposits are expenses and you cannot edit them
. excellent app
the best app ever!!!!. there's no word i can use to describe this app. this is the best app i've ever seen. the functionality and the ease of use on iphone is amazing. 95% of my daily transactions are done on my phone. i love this app. good job intuit. no app does it better.
coowner. most of our business is at the customer sites and this app makes real invoicing, estimating and other accounting possible right at the customer site. it's constantly improving, too.
slow, expensive and with poor support. i have been using quckbooks for a year now. it's terribly slow on here and also on the pc, the support is dire, and mostly just does not respond. the only thing that happens quickly in this app is the removal of service if you fail to pay your subscription. avoid! now i'm looking for an alternative that i can migrate my business info etc to without too much fuss.
everything i need. the quickbooks app has met every one of my needs for my small handyman business. i love the ability to email customers estimates, invoices, and sales receipts while i am standing there with them. i have only been using the app for a little over a month but i feel good about my decision to go with quickbooks online.
. i use quickbooks online with a scheduling program that is synced together. i am a one man company but you could never tell. thanks to quickbooks. l also have increased profits
. using technology to make life simple again !
. capable app for your expenses and keeping tabs on accounts on the go.
i wanted to like it. but..... i didn’t appreciate the daily phone calls asking if i needed help .... i just wanted an app that would let me do my own thing and not feel harassed
. when it works it works great. however i have to periodically delete and reinstall the app because it gets buggy entering new expenses. it will get locked in the expense screen. in the locked screen if i hit save 5 times it will record the transaction 5 times while still sitting in the entry screen. **update the developer solution did not work.
. i've been using this for my business for 5 years. i love it because i csn do it on my phone through the app and desktop! it is also easy to collect and sibmitt all my tax info at tax time. works for me, easy to learn, and reliable.
finally signature for iphone. love it!!! all of my invoices are generated via my iphone 6, and it was frustrating without having that feature. touch id is a great touch! i like the ability to have different invoice options, but wish i could design it exactly the way i want it. keep up the great work with updates.
. app refuses login on my phone. pixel 2
. i like the apps easy access but it truly suck because nothing is accessable properly. writing an estimate or invoice on this app is not possible. not properly anyway. its really not pleasant either going online via cellphone because it zooms in and out improperly. its very frustrating. as for quickbooks via laptop i love it. quickbooks has truly made my life much easier and way more organized. but the app needs to be fixed and also online via cellphone bugs.
. sometimes glitchy. some days it works some days it doesnt but overall worth ther money becasue the website always works
. very close to cancelling my subscription as app doesn't work. after adding 45 receipts i get an error message that my request cannot be added and i should call customer support. have tried reinstalling clearing cache signing out and nothing works permanently very frustrated
amazing. so simple to use makes my life a lot easier as everything can be done literally within minutes
useless. unless i am missing something i find this app absolutely useless. it does not show all of my accounts, so i can't see the account balances. supplier balances also don't show, if i need to play a supplier. it still needs a lot of work, so i will stick with using my macbook until then. it's actually not even worth using.
office portability. i can post info on the fly, keeping my books up to date, even up to the minute. my clients can get estimates instantly when asking for them. my bookkeeper can see what's going on with me right now.
. quickbooks is perfect for managing your business expended and for generating invoices and receipts.
. makes my invoice and reconciling so much easier.
great app. i use this everyday for my landscape business. couldn't do it without it. thanks!
unable to sign in.... same issue many users are having with the latest update, i can no longer sign into my account with the app.
works well on samsung note 2 & 4. i used the app mainly to create invoices when i'm out of the office. it's so awesome to be able to do this on the fly!
. sales receipt and invoice not round off available in mobile apps create invoice not show retail invoice and tax invoice in mobile i am a paid version user and i am pc login all options are work properly but mobile apps issue i have made complete 4 tims in call center but agent ask me team work this issue
. recent updates have greatly improved this app! it used to be hard to switch back to it if you opened another app, but that's now fixed. i love being able to invoice customers right away, record an expense (along with a photo of the receipt) and take a payment.
. compared with the apple version, the android version scrolling doesn't work
app crashes. ever since update cannot open app. need to fix immediately.
great app. love this on the computer and really love the mobile app! it's great to be able to get things done anywhere.
quickbooks. it's a great app.
crash books pro. this terrific app asks you every few minutes to rate their program knowing that you want to tell the world how you can't send out an invoice without the app crashing. *update* i am having more issues with the app then ever. i can only assume quickbooks is either more useless then i thought. or they are retaliating for my review of their product. i have never had any program work this bad and i have worked it.
logs me off all the time. every single day this app automatically logs me out, displays a message that there’s been a critical update, and that i need to log in again. even worse it requires you to actually enter the password rather than allowing face id authentication.
awesome!. fantastic app. as a freelancer i am often away from my office. being able to create estimates and have my clients sign them on the spot has been great. and being able to send invoices from anywhere has absolutely changed my life! love it.
. your app is garbage. i've had to reset my password 4 times and have the verification code texted and phoned to me several times and still nothing. thanks for wasting 1 hour of my time that i cannot get back😠😠😠😠😠
poor. if you write a review and the nickname is taken you have to start all over again. app is very limited and web version has problems with ipad pro
. great app
. won't update data. data is 137 days old and counting. refreshes don't help and uninstallingreinstalling is a waste of time. thanks for nothing.
great software. this does everything i absolutely need it to do. i wouldn't use anything else it's easy to manage they have great customer service and i don't have any complaints about it keep up the great work thanks for making my job a lot easier.
aka labels. great app. highly recommended
. very disappointed this is a spotty business resource. sync issues. i entered a customer contact once and it appeared as a new payment in my activity tab. update: i have cancelled for other reasons. looking elsewhere. wish it wouldve worked.
. please add a option of journal entry jn app
great program. i find myself keeping better records. very user friendly. great program
good app. it works really well to manage a business. a few things could be easiermore intuitive to do, but otherwise a solid app that gets the job done.
can’t upload receipts. it’s incredibly ridiculous that you can’t upload receipts from anywhere but your photos app. what if you get emailed an invoice? nope can’t upload it!
michael. great for my business nice to alter estimates and convert to invoice on the job, why do you need acsess to phone and gps
great app. it works great
app problems. app keeps crashing haven’t been able to create invoices for days
awful app  doesn’t fully sync with online data. i keep getting notifications about a 6 month overdue invoice, which i used for testing. however, when you try and remove the invoice, it can’t find it. the online version is fine if a little overpriced for soletrader business, but this app, which costs nothing, is worth exactly that. it’s next to useless.
. it's good but could be better. limited functionalities on the mobile app.
. this was almost my solution to doing invoices on the road. unfortunately, they do not allow pdf attachments when sending an email. i need to send a pdf not jpegs so until this option is added this app is useless for me.
broken app. latest update broke it. app will no longer launch and immediately crashes. now looking at alternatives.
. easy to use, very good app to invoice an manage the accountant anywere
the bad stories are all true. i echo all the bad reviews you’ve seen.
way too slow. and reports are very limited. not ready for prime time.
i love it. love the invoices!
. awesome app and integration all around!!!
. the app is not updating on my phone
good app. helps me run my business in paperless mode. crashes when i push terms while creating invoice or estimate. please fix this.
keeps locking up. the app keeps telling me i need to update to the latest version, but i already have it. it won't let me log on. frustrating. please fix or revert back to previous version until glitches are fixed.
excellent!. a great app. easy to use and gives the features of the browser version on the phone. a small flaw: the + to add new things in, specifically on an iphone x, sits a little too low meaning it’s under the home bar. it’s optimised nicely for an x, though!
. not free at all.. they take your valuable information such as email and phone numbers.. then say its 30 days trial.. you will have to pay to get this apps.. many of good free accounting apps are available in play store..
. quickbooks notified me of this update at 1am. not nice.
never has worked on my s7 edge. i loved this app when it worked with my htc. since i switched to this phone, it keeps giving me an error message and despite talking with support multiple times, nothing has been done to resolve this. i have uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times and it has not resolved the problem. i have seen similar issues reported with this phone.
. really like being able to send invoices and estimates out in the field.
not overly user friendly. no payroll on mobile, ipad or online site via ipad which is very disappointing and not at all helpful in onsite situations. update to include payroll in these instances would be great but fairly useful tool otherwise
so easy.. i love using this app, it is a lot easier than the online webpage version. i love it.
app crashing ios13. app is crashing in io13
. works great until about a week ago. now i can't save anything from the app it won't sync basically nothing is working right with the app. i even tried installing it on another android phone and had identical problems. don't bother trying to call customer service they say they have nothing to do with the app and that's it.
convenient. moving to quickbooks online plus has been a great move. there was a small learning curve but it is very stable and now we're very happy that we made the change. the best part is using the app on my iphone
. this app has been a life saver!
. this app doesn't work! such a disappointment to say the least! i'll edit my review once the app is available for use! still not working! uninstalling for now! i hope that you fix it!
great app. great app!
quickbooks. great app. excellent business account program to run my business from my iphone.
. constantly updating features great app! they keep adding features that makes it easier to use.
login error. useless if you can't even trust it to login properly.
system modify for the better. great system except when you send an invoice out there is no way to mark it that it has been sent out . so you constantly have to keep a note book with all the customers and what is going on with each individual invoice.
touch id rules. much easier to login now.
. the app is horrible. doesn't update ky information, ia like a month behind. very frustrating. you are good at billing me every month, that part is up to date🙄.
quickbooks. quickbooks has been absolutely amazing overall. main issue is customer service and their ability to provide customer support for the app. i was required to ph 3 different numbers, one being out of service. once i finally spoke to csr he was extremely friendly but did state they haven’t been provided proper training to assist with app related issues but would do his best to help. i would upgrade to 4 or 5 stars if they provide a user friendly option for support.
fantastic app!. i can perform easily 90% of our quickbooks administrative work on the app version. this allows our business to save time and money! way to go guys!
. i am very very convenient and easy billing....so i am happy...my feelings is good...best app for small business
good but too many bug with ios. after the good first impression, using daily is little bit frustrating. example: problems with input dates and items. sometime the calendar doesn't open etc.
app won't open after latest update! please fix asap!. app won't open after latest update! please fix asap!
not useful at all. this was a waste of time. i need to be able to reconcile and do more than look at my recent transactions. quick books is useless unless you're on a computer.
no multi currency in app. there is no multi currency function in the ipad app making it useless for entering overseas travel expenses.
amazing. it is a great app. so powerful i can do my full estimate and invoice and the best feature entering in my receipts for expenses and it's so easy!
pretty bad. they will lie about the processing time for electronic payments. also, the customer services is the worst you will get. after waiting 30 minutes on the phone, you will get a representative with english as a 5th language. good luck.
. was using quick books online on laptop and it was fantastic, now since have to be on the move, am using on my android phone to generate invoices and it amazing experience, just dont need laptop anymore. great stuff. recommend to all smes
expenses. you cannot cost expenses to a particular job or client
new to qb on line. brilliant package but did need support on getting the data i migrated over sorted. but worth the monthly charges. great job quick books.
app does not work. i have been unable to see my profits and loss on the app for months now and often the app does not let me log in. i get constant errors. i have spent hours with tech support on the phone all they say is “it’s a known bug”. they have not been able to tell me for months when will the app work again.
best app for start up company. hands down this app is the best for any size company, once its all set and customized to your company you & your employees will operate more efficiently. take your time to learn it don't be afraid to call customer service they are very friendly and helpful.
crashing non stop. keeps crashing when trying to sign in, couldn't even use trial, useless crap, trial expired, done the usual uninstallreinstall, still didn't work
. crazy how you can remove headaches with this app.
non functional. could not edit invoices, tried to edit terms would not allow very frustrating
. great app to help track expenses
. much easier than using the mobile site on my phone and very convenient for sending invoices
. great app.
disappointing. this is a very unstable product with an unreliable app server. if my accountant didn't require it, i would not use it! my deposits have not updated for two weeks. i'll let you know when that's fixed.
better than desktop version. easier to use than computer version. much faster. very efficient. excellent for companies on the go.
great accounting app. very happy with my quickbooks app.
. great smb accounting software. use it for my company and have had no issues at all. customer support is responsive as well.
agree with useless. not what i expected. does not have the same functions as qbo. disappointed! would have been great and convenient if all functions were available.
. i'm getting to grow my business with this app
great app... works amazingly well.
dont work no more. terrible tech support! app quit working over a month ago...tech support is useless...you better change your advertising....you should probably get it for false advertising cause you are lying to the public
user friendly!. this is definitely the bookkeeping app for anyone who is not attuned to being a business owner
thumbs up for the business help!!!. take the time to go through the tutorials and this is an amazing app to help with any small business!!!
best financial app for nonfinance people. the most user friendly, cutting edge, accessible and collaborative financial app you can find which is affordable and does the job with least amount of financial knowledge.
very helpful. haven't had any problems with this.
. invoice design could look better.
. simple and easy to use. professional
hideous to use on smartphones. before accessing, must always get email code, and switching screens hides quickbooks application. then, can't access checking account balances. very typical of a quickbooks experience.
very handy accounting app. this app is very useful to always have a snapshot of your business at your fingertips.
paid app. app costs 8.99 a month
. the worst app in the entire google play store its useless dosent work correctly impossible to navigate the person who made it ought to be fired its a disgrace
. great but i would like to be able to customise the quote and invoice templates and a bit disappointed that the mileage tracking is not part of this its a different app with it's own cost otherwise great
. great app
. was working ok then app was updated,. help centre can't give time to fix or troubleshoot to be able to use this whilst out on jobsites not happy at all costing money
ceo. quickbooks has a great feature that you can upload the receipt through camera! however, the camera should be smart enough to pick up information on the receipt, such as date, vendor name, amount, etc.... that will be intuitive!!
easy to follow. app is easy to follow even if you are not an accountant.
this is useless for invoicing. useless: on the product list it only shows first two words and the ..... i have multiple variations in same item. i can’t search product with sku, when i search by name it only shows first two words and then dots. i cant add the exact product on invoice. so its useless.
. great app & software. very helpful. would be nice to be able to keyword search within all estimatesinvoices.
how... to switch companies in this app?
contractor couldn't live without it. i use this app every time i bill a client and can provide him with an accurate, complete invoice and receive payment on the spot. importing customers from my contacts is a great help. a musthave complement to quickbooks online.
ios 13 not supported. the app will not even start!
it begins.... i liked it so much i have it for 2 seperate businesses and just moved my household accounting onto qbo. the accountant can get to everything from his desk, me from my phone. auto download of account data, auto reports are awesome!
"works great for my business needs. i can send estimates quickly and they look professional. one feature i really enjoy is knowing my customer has viewed the estimate! occasionally the ""+"" arrow doesn't seem to respond on the app... otherwise i'm very pleased. dc"
. easy to use app with handy creation of invoice any time ,anyplace you are
monthly fee. didn't realize that there was a $13month fee after the 30 day trial if i'm not already using it.
good resource. i will update this as i see necessary, haven't made a customer service call yet. but overall the navigation is something to get used to because it's very in depth and many details that you would expect are included with the software.
small business owner. i am quite pleased with how fast and simple it is to use.
terrible. terrible. the support can't even figure it out.
. sucks. cant login. all intuit apps are broken. support takes weeks to respond. i going to cancel my monthly service and go with a different accounting software. longtime customer but no longer.
. love this app. i've been running my small business for 2 years using it and it's been great.
needs to be full featured. i love the program but hate that i can’t do into my vendor bills on the app for ipad. i can’t enter them in or view them on ipad. i can on browser view but even it needs to update as everything gets cit off in chrome and when you click the menu button to hide it it does not slide everything over so you can see more.
bill pay ach services via intuit are so difficult. 2 months 3 support tickets, 3 phones 1.5 hours each, and so many emails i lost count... still can not get the ach funds deposited. if i did not know better i think they are just trying to see if i give up so they can keep the funds... i am not impressed, and quite honestly will probably cancel all of it.
. it collects all your information first then it tells you it's paid app.
. does what it says on the tin.
cant even start the app. how to rate a app that not even running
. great app and easy to use!
jtw1234567. awesome app. i don't have time to do all of this and run my business too.
pretty good. love that i can enter payments wherever i am. don't love that i can't easily see my account transactions.
. i can't view estimates on this app unless i input them in manually. they will not upload. only customer information and invoices. this makes it very hard to be onpoint with my crew.
. i love this app
"rarely works. the quickbooks app worked great for awhile. now with the last update, nothing refreshes. i'm always receiving messages that it can't ""update at this time. try again later."" very disappointing"
amazing!. i have used everything but quick books because of the price point mostly but because of a coupon code i received i decided to give it a shot and i don’t know why i didn’t start here in the first place. thank you guys so much, it has made my life so much easier!
jan 2019 update is a fail. i’m a daily  hourly user. the january 2019 update won’t keep me logged in. after about 90 seconds i get an error message and get logged out.
great accounting apps. great apps..
. awesome app.
great mobile app. perfect for my mobile power washing company as all my customers and estimates are available at the touch of a button no matter where i am!
horrible accounting program. barely an accounting program. one would think qb would create an online version mirroring their desktop software. navigating the online software is a headache, let alone using it for basic accounting purposes. of course qb ever improving their software is as likely to happen as me winning the lottery.
"not as good as it was.. getting worse. incorrect allocation of funds to invoices. the mobile app doesn't allow expense entering anymore (""we're working on it""  november 16). yes, you can see invoices and forward from the phone, but wouldn't want to do anything else. come on qb, get your act together. u.k."
knoxville premier painting. iit is a great app
love this app tho. 😘👌👍👏😊♡✔
terrible wont setup after 3weeks. don’t even waste your time with this. they keep giving you barriers to setting up payroll and when you meet the criteria they inputting errors in your account. the end result is you paying for a service you’ll never receive
closing. can’t use this app without it crapping out on me. i need this to be reliable for my business and it’s not. unfortunate really. jeff
blair. app is extremely unstable. every time i need to get on it i have to force quit the app and re loggin. i have an iphone x and it runs horrible on here. hoping they fix this asap because i run my entire service company from the app
adding a photo to a receipt should be simple. apparently there was a recent update that removed the add photo option to tranasactions. it's not there any longer. i called support and they tell me i have to create a note, add the photo to that note, then go find the transaction and add the note to it.
changed my life..!. qbo has made the bookkeeping side of my business a dream. it has given me so much time back. if i forget the rest my business to run as smoothly, i would be a happy man…
fee increase is a bad deal. fees increased but same services rendered. otherwise it’s a decent app. i’m disappointed that they get people to invest all there invoices and history in app and program then up the fees in them nearly double. can’t trust a company that does that to ya.
. i've been using intuit, quickbooks, quicken for more years than i can count. i would never use another accounting software! i love quickbooks! easy to use
qbo and this app two thumbs down.. how does such a large company make such a crappy product. basic logical steps can’t be completed. you go to summit a improvement and tons of people have listed the same things and nothing ever gets fixed. the app jumps back and forth between web view and app view. support is horrible. you can’t even move different parts of the invoice or estimate around in the app. switching to zoho
superb app. works everytime for me, allows me to update invoices, expenses and record payments.
does not show suppliers. since update app does not show suppliers or let you add expense, which makes mobile app a waste of time
very disappointed. i'm very disappointed because i have been unable to login on with my iphone or macbook pro. i tried to get help through customer service but all i got was a link. very disappointed!!
doesn't work for ipad. this app doesn't even load my company info. it keeps returning error trying to load company info. i have contacted quickbooks a number of times and all they say is they are working on the issue and to use a web browser version in the mean time. i have seen about 4 updates released and not one of them has fixed this issue. when will this be fixed?
very good app. in general very good app. missing key features like banking, updates etc.
intuitive and very useful!. i'm surprised at how easy this app is to use and how much functionality it has. i'm able to do pretty much all of my typical day to day tasks within this app. it's extremely useful to be able to quickly put together an estimate for a client from my phone or categorize a transaction. intuit, you've done a great job here!
. complete waste of time app doesn't sync with the online version. the advice given by the help to delete browser history and cache doesn't work either. unreinstalling the app doesn't work.. in the long run you will end up wasting too much time on this program. be warned !! ###edit i've cleared cache, deleted app data it it still doesn't sync.. in particular it's the supplier list and transactions that are all missing
. conforme já relatado por outros usuários, o app oferece uma promoção de r$13,99. porém ao efetuar a compra o valor é quase r$50,00... engana na propaganda então já parto do princípio que o restante pode não ser bom!
invoice won’t work with ios 13. i’m trying to put a new customer in on a invoice and the app just turns black and white screen. plz update! i run my entire business off this app
. i am unable to open the app passed the sign in page. just continually crashes right after logging in. poor app
nightmare. since the latest update quickbooks has been a nightmare. multimillion dollar company that relies on mobile invoicing that does not work now!
. great app for any small business would recommend it to anybody who has a small business very easy and accurate
. how do you update the bank feed manually? there's no refresh button and pulling down from the top doesn't work? super laggy after the latest update...re intuit, nope, no refresh pull down or button next to the + also, still crazy slow and choppy
so simple it hurts. a comprehensive yet easy to use accounting package...brilliant...
doesn’t work with ios13. just updated ios 13 app doesn’t load. even after deleting and readding.
. app data is never accurate. i hate to login via mobile web to get accurate numbers. misleading and frustrating
perfect. i migrated over from the computer version and so far it's awesome. i went out and bought a verizon tablet to make my billing easier in the field. i now can do everything before i walk out of the customers house, the days of going to the truck to write up a invoice are over!!!
business handled from my phone. works well, update is even better. can create invoices, print, email, track and reconcile business spending. shows if invoices have been sent ( when emailing) as well as read. would give 5 stars if i were able to record bank deposits with this app. currently customer payments remain in undeposited funds until i log in to the desktop site. also wish i could save time by printing batch invoices. overall very useful, easy way to handle business on the go.
instant customer service 👌. great app for small to mid size business. phenomenal integration from windows 10. so far so good. thanks.
good for on the road. let's me add invoices and expenses while away from the office, works well.
. works all fine and easy to use. pro tip: if anything breaks, delete your local cache and try again 😊 (thanks to the qb support)
room for improvement. it is a great app. it has a lot of room for improvement. i need to be able to assign each expense to individual jobs so i can job cost. also i need to be able to create multiple jobs per customer, ie sub jobs.
dreadful just unusable plus desktop version same. started well. then couldn’t input expenses on the app. hard and long winded to get support. now cant enter invoices and reciepts on desktop version!! totally pointless package and when you have r pugh troubles running your own business!!!!! think i will go back to my accountant and just dump everything with him each month as the hours this is costing me plus unbelievable stress!!!!
bad update. was close to perfect, or at least practical. since the last update, this app is useless to me. hoping this will change!
can't even login. useless program  i can only use web browser to access, app is not working at all
terrible to customers. your website deleted my account, which i spent hours putting together, and had every intention of subscribing and paying for this service, and then when i spoke with customer service to see what happened, i was told to call two other numbers for the same service, then placed on hold by the final number for 510 minutes, and was hung up on. they had my number and never called me back. horrible service to your customers. i will pursue a different company.
thumbs up. wish it was cheaper, but i have to admit i love it and it makes my business easier to run.
. only thing i wish is that the app was more gear to service type industry like pest control other than that phenomenal app
nice app but i’d like to access the inventory. when you are out and making an invoice it is very important to be able to check the inventory
". very disappointed considering i do use the online quickbooks on a daily basis. i installed the app. signed in. then came up with an error message. tried to log in again and it keeps coming up with ""signing in..."" but nothing is happening. 10 minutes later, app uninstalled!!!"
sooo easy. i love quickbooks. has made my life so much easier
. not as useful as the web version but great way to capture receipts
it just keeps getting better. i love that this app continues to change for the good of the clients
auto service. makes my invoicing a lot quicker and easier to get taken care of.
great. efficient. user friendly.. really enjoying having this app option for my business. absolutely loving quickbooks intuit online!! really like it can upload photos of receipts. my only suggestion would be to allow photos to be upload to an itemized bill. thank you.
works good. makes business life easier and works great.
missing key features. most notably, there is no way to create bills on qb for ios. this is a major feature that is just not available without a desktop. i can’t even use a mobile browser to login because the web gui gets cut off when entering a bill, even in landscape mode on an ipad.
great bookkeeping app. this is a great app for tracking expenses sending invoices and overall bookkeeping. it is especially great if you are a mobile service and always on the go, easytouse from your phone or tablet or computer!
more options. app is good for basics but it would be helpful if statements could be printed from the app.
time saver, makes everything simple. thus app saves time and allows for doing simple tasks on the go making my church more accurate and efficient
blair. app is extremely unstable. every time i need to get on it i have to force quit the app and re loggin. i have an iphone x and it runs horrible on here. hoping they fix this asap because i run my entire service company from the app
. excellent accounting software. does everything i need to manage my business accounts.
great app for small business. makes invoicing on the go easy!!
more than annoyed..... new update: 8916, still have to enter my password every time i open the app. touch id or app pin what is that??? 🤔 this is so annoying.... especially in front of customers!! tired of wasting my time. i've deleted and reinstalled the app to no avail. it appears you guys are never going to get it right....
love it!. quickbooks has changed the way we invoice and track expenses. the ability to provide estimates then convert to invoices is amazing. the mobile app allows me to work on the go.
quicken & quickbooks been around since the 80's. fantastic accounting software. great for anyone to use. teach your kids!😄😍😘💖💎💎💎
horrible. it’s true the only reason i will install qb on my phone is to record expense on the fly,and it doesn’t do it
app not working. the app won't open on my phone.... just says downoading company info. have already rebooted phone and reinstalled
. at some point the app stopped attaching photo receipts to my expenses. now i've lost several months worth of receipts.
. unless you are truly tech savvy avoid this app since finding help was as bad as getting help from fb or instagram in my opinion.
. often fails to sign in. limited app that hardly works. skip the download and just visit the website.
. easy to use & productive... few features of the webpage version are not available on the app such as print or downloading packing slip, can't prepare a purchase order, etc. but overall, the app is helpful. thanks.
. was working ok then app was updated,. help centre can't give time to fix or troubleshoot to be able to use this whilst out on jobsites not happy at all costing money
. a little slow at times. navigation could be better
. app never up to date with website or it does not show you everything you can see online. sometimes you can't even see anyone's invoices or estimates. always an issue.
needs updates. same app. works okay but very limited functionality. i figured since online version was updated they would've made changes here too. disappointed at how's long it's taking qb to add accounting functionality to this app.
it works ok. using this app for serval years now. mainly i’m bothered by the small glitches and performance of the app, not so much quickbooks. every so often a new annoyance will pop up.
great. app used to be useless while desktop version did what i needed. now app is highly functional and i use it constantly for my business. great, reasonably priced. i highly recommend.
broken app?. once i log in it says there has been an error and closes. could someone from intuit please get in contact with me about this?
. seamless
great app for small business!. i love being able to enter my expenses and invoices from my phone. very convenient and makes tax time much easier!
horrible mobile support!. this app has a ton of problems and nobody at intuit cares to fix it. app won't load half the time, invoices do not show up, errors all the time, signature capture doesn't work, and no support available for the mobile app. the only thing they know is to tell you to uninstall and reinstall it which fixes nothing! if they don't get their issues fixed, i am switching!
they just keep changing the app.. my biggest complaint about the app is the limited features on customer entries. the pc version you can enter a customer as tax exempt on the phone you can't. further if you open the customer information on the phone and save it it will clear the tax exempt status on the pc version as well. so it is a constant battle to keep who is and isn't exempt straight.
five stars!. has helped out tremendously when it comes to my business. it makes it so much easier to use then the paper receipt books. it helps me stay organized and keeps me updated to the second. thanks quickbooks!
slow, expensive and with poor support. i have been using quckbooks for a year now. it's terribly slow on here and also on the pc, the support is dire, and mostly just does not respond. the only thing that happens quickly in this app is the removal of service if you fail to pay your subscription. avoid! now i'm looking for an alternative that i can migrate my business info etc to without too much fuss.
for last month since major online update its is useless. when i login it tells me i don’t have a subscription. i call support they tell me to uninstall the app and reinstall. after reinstall the login works but you cannot switch between your companies. i called them back. they said no one else is reporting this. three users in my offivr are having the same problem. i love the iphone app for entering receipts on the go but i can’t even do that now.
highly recommended. it saves me a lot time from working on invoices and so. it help me on whenever i need it, i just have to take out my phone and i'm able to use what i need to.
business owner. qb app is so hard to use and is different on every device. if you lose connection while creating an estimateinvoice etc. you will lose all info imputed and have to reenter everything again
all of my clients love it!. the ease of use is fantastic. i love that i can quickly load multiple accounts. the qbo app makes my job so much easier because my clients love tracking expenses and sending invoices on the go!
nothing but glitches on my ipad. really not worth it nothing but problems one operating on ipad
great software. with each update this app gets better and better, great integration with turbo tax small business
. works good for what i need which is keeping track of jobs and money invoices and estimates
. great app, easy to use, very helpful and profesional
remove the update. the new update is not as functional as the previous version. can't add dollar amounts to the itemized lines anymore? this is mandatory. also we need to be able to mark jobs as accepted on the app, can only do so on the computer. fix it!!
ease of use. simple and intuitive. makes it easy to review accounts on the go and create invoices onsite.
easy and super user friendly. first time user of this type of app but it was easy to set up. sent out my first invoice after 1hr already.
love the app. excellent app just wish you guys would add the ability to turn on quantity while leaving rate off in estimates and invoices
couldn't perform like we do without. great app!!!! highly recommended. tracks and categories everything with moderate input from you. great on tax day!
. this is not mobile supportive app in india
major improvements. in recent months there have been great updates that have made the app very functional inbetween times i'm not at a pc. you can't expect it to run the same as on your pc.
still useless. what is this for? can't see the check register, can't add vendor bills. you should be able to access all aspects of qb online. i guess its ok if all you want to do is look at pretty graphs.
. exceptional support
would never trade qbs. you guys are incredible, from customer service to product. i've been a customer for years and this app just tops it all off. love the ability to have as much in one. payroll, invoice, file attachment i can go on and on! keep it up!
very unintuitive. is hard to tell which expenses are finalized which ones aren't. it's just not a very friendly interface.
mr david prince. great app. i use it all the time on my phone and tablet.it works seamlessly with qbo. invoicing, receipts, checking my account, giving it to my bookeeper all easy and on the go. i couldn't do without it now.
no way to select india as a country. hello i am using iphone xs .. i downloaded ur app .. i am not able to select india as the country.. what seems to be the problem ?
quickbooks scheduler. we love quickbooks and how well it works in the field. we got the gopayment as well. the only thing i wish quickbooks would add is a scheduler for jobs open, accepted, and estimates pending.
. great app for my business, and very simple for first timers
. this app is rubbish. it doesn't do the single thing you'd think was necessary using phone camera to take photo of receipt to attach to transaction.
good to review. i haven't got deep into it to create billing invoices yet but just to review what i've done from the work station, it's great.
great! the app we need, but don't deserve. i use it to run my 6 figure company! everything works great and makes things tremendously easy
. i use this app for my small business, and it's fantastic everything i need and then some. all in an affordable package,and it's simple to use also.
pretty lame. seriously? the thing crashes a lot , but i can deal with that. the real problem for me is the lack of calendar in the invoice line item. i would love to use this, but if i can't put the date that i provided a service in my invoice, the it is useless to me. too bad safari doesn't work either, or i would just use that.
need ipad update. the ipad app should be as capable as the desktop version. when are we going to see this? iphone app is pretty stout but the ipad app needs update and soon.
bank transactions not loaded. there are several limitations with this app. but my major issue is the inability to load bank transactions. the connected bank account goes sometimes for weeks or months without the transactions transferred to qb. other times they are uploaded every couple of days. there is no option to upload the transactions manually through the app. i called customer service but no one helped. this makes the phone app pretty much useless.
need to see register. touch enabled but still wants me to login with password. disappointed.
great program. i find myself keeping better records. very user friendly. great program
best i've used.. not the most expensive i've tried but by far the easiest. takes minutes to send an instant invoice. 1010 from me.
help desk is horrible. please hire someone who either speaks english or will transfer your call to someone who can when directed to do so no fewer than 5 times. pathetic.
superbly designed. having used two competitors' products before, i've been very pleasantly surprised with quickbooks. it's really easy to use but, at the same time, it has lots of really helpful features. the app is well designed but my only gripe is that i am sometimes unable to login. the problem usually corrects itself after a while, but it's a bit annoying when i need it at the time. nevertheless, the product is so good that this doesn't even bother me much.
". can not change most settings comes an error ""you and xxxx were working on this at same time "") tried on different browsers, nothing changed"
. i'm getting sick of this app real fast it comes tr manly crashes i try calling the 1800 number and nothing
fantastic!!. i have been using myob for years , just swapped over . i am finding it so simple to use . no worries bringing over my info from myob . love being able to use the app on the go !!!
. simply superb
another weak quickbooks mobile app. once again, with excitement i upgrade only to be letdown. when will intuit make a full function app? i love the message that tells me the function isn't't available for my device but i can access it from my pc...great, i'm still tied to my desk! why bother with the mobile app then?? i love how i can only rate this useless app once in the lifetime of having it,i would give it no stars if i could!
problem with update please fix. iphone x, after updating the app, it doesn’t let me edit any transactions at all, i can only approve what is recognized transaction, an unrecognized transaction is not responsive to touchscreen commands so i have to cancel edit. please fix
. can't make a payment no options anywhere need to get invoice done
love this app. fantastic and easy use. makes business transactions easy
. great app.
. it works only ok. if there was a better 3rd party app, i'd use it. most of the time i'm frustrated using this app. either buttons don't work, attachments don't save, or some other random instability. i want to do more with the app and i want it to work every time. the design is questionable too. why are things labled differently than in the full version?
for phone. could be easier to use if it was more like the pc edition
. i messaged support about my subscription it was not what i wanted. i cancelled the account last month and was still billed and on the subscription. would like a refund on my card
easy to use. great system and easy to use on the go or at your computer.
better than xero. brilliant app. seamless to use. all of my clients now use it!
. convenient, but sometimes it freezes.
employees. just need a section where you can add employee start and finish times. which would be a huge help to keep track of hours on the fly
no place for attachments. when i first opened the app i was so excited. i have been a quick book user for years and now everything is available at a touch from my ipad. but the only thing that was missing was a place to put attachments from the banking screen. so bummed hope this gets an update with the attachment feature.
very handy.. great app for when i'm away from my pc and need to sort invoice or sort my accounts.
horrible mobile support!. this app has a ton of problems and nobody at intuit cares to fix it. app won't load half the time, invoices do not show up, errors all the time, signature capture doesn't work, and no support available for the mobile app. the only thing they know is to tell you to uninstall and reinstall it which fixes nothing! if they don't get their issues fixed, i am switching!
horrible. constant crashes at the worst of times!!! aarrrggghhhh!
issue. man it tells me it’s not supported even tho it updates keep saying the same message
you get what you pay for (sometimes not even!). you can't do much with the ipad version except create and receive invoices. i had debated leaving easy books for this, thinking it would have more professional features, but it actually has fewer.
update ruined app. crashes constantly and that when you can get in. half the time it’s ‘downloading company data’ and won’t let you do anything. i find this making it actually harder to run my business.
keeps crashing. app doesn’t work . no updates in months
cannot download all data since last update. since enabling touched, after the last update, i keep getting notified all my data cannot be downloaded
so simple!. on the go accounting.
incomparable with ipad pro. this app works terrible with ipad pro. basically made this business expense a complete waste as the app and web program useless on the ipad pro. extremely disappointed and frustrated.
pretty good..... i'm somewhat of a novice independent contractorpsychotherapist. i've been using quickbooks since 2014 and have been using the app for about a year. the dates of invoice reflect the date of service so this is helpful. i know for sure i do not use all features to their full capacity but it's worth the monthly investment for sure.
app freezes. since updating my iphone to 13.0 the quickbooks app freezes once it opens. at this point it is completely useless.
can't log i. i haven't been able to log in the past 4 updates _ this was the easiest way for me to mark payment as it was received given the mobility.
how come i cant make pos on the app?. this should have this ability builtin.
. this app doesn't work! such a disappointment to say the least! i'll edit my review once the app is available for use!
this makes business owner life that much easier. i love this app, intuit is the best period. i also have mint app but this is easier for me as a business owner as weird as it may sound
critical simple feature still missing  for years!. please add the ability to print or download packing slips from the mobile app. everything else can wait till i am back in the office. sometimes a packing slip must be done in a rush. mobile app is useless to me without the packing slip feature.
great app. this is exactly what i need to manage my small business. it also keeps my accounting bills smaller.
. always crash on start since a long time. unable to use it on note8. reinstalled many times. please fix it.
great app. if you run a business this app is a no brainer. just like being on the computer.
bookkeeping on the go. i own a small tax and accounting firm and this app has done wonders for customer service! being able to give my clients real time information from anywhere at anytime is a huge plus! i only wish this app would allow me to process ach and credit card payments on the fly!
count on almost $500yr in subscription costs. intuit has been very smart about hiding needed features in higher sub plans. get going for a while and you’ll find you need the highest tier subscription. no thanks. hello wave accounting.
junk update = worthless app. since the latest update, my qb app shows an error saying that my session has expired immediately after i log in. i can't use it at all. pc access is okay.
mr. o'neal. great program.
. app is not working after the recent update, i am not able to login. it's simply goes blank after tapping the qb icon
owner. great app. keeps me up to date.
. great app
"soooo slow. i have been using this app for about three years , and it was very functional and useful, but now, almost every time i open it, it says ""downloading data,"" and stays there... for 35 minutes doesnt matter whether my phone is on wifi or cell coverage. i hope they fix this bug."
. simple and easy to use
perfect for a small consulting firm. this app is everything i need for my consulting firm. easy to use and easy to keep track of expenses on the road. invoicing is a breeze. love the data in the cloud. take a pic and throw away those receipts! works flawlessly between my mac, ipad and iphone. no complaints whatsoever.
practical intuitive program, perfect for the novice bookkeeper. great program for those on the go with little time or experience for bookkeeping
simple to use on the go.. really liking how simple it is to use & track things.
. very close to cancelling my subscription as app doesn't work. after adding 45 receipts i get an error message that my request cannot be added and i should call customer support. have tried reinstalling clearing cache signing out and nothing works permanently very frustrated
not compatible with my lg g4 phone. i bought new lg g4 and installed the app on it, once i try to sign in the app crashes , i sent email to customer service and it has been three months since then, they keep saying we are trying to solve the issue, worst customer service ever.
. after this last update the app is worse, you can't see your last invoice or overdue invoices, you can't create new invoice or see your customer or create new customer.
user friendly. works great!. great app for running a small business. easy to use for estimates, invoicing, accounts receivable, etc. can't wait to integrate it with our payroll to make billing for labor even easier. highly recommend.
ok. app ok
progress billing & payroll. those two items alone differentiate this on line accounting software from all the others. their tech support is always helpful. progress billing is done through projects, it’s getting better, the use ability is getting better. this also allows project costing. 
missing a lot of functionality. big disappointment from regular quickbooks. both qbo and quickbooks app have a lot to be desired. they both lack ability to make custom fields in customer database. cannot make deposits or see the check register via the app. the big hype was to be able to access quickbooks from any device. sure enough you get access but you can't do much with it so what a waste.
ios 9 broke it. ios 9 broke the app and now every time it's trying to download company data just crashes. uninstalled and reinstalled. also wish you could accept transactions on this.
horrible horrible app. this new version is terrible! it will not save invoices for payments when i apply them, but then when i log in to the desktop version there's duplicate and triplicate payments.
. excellent i love this app. have used for months on droid razr, not one problem. integrated with my computer, i use this in the field for sprinkler business. 100 percent happy.
great app, prepare to be spammed. i keep getting marketing emails even though i unsubscribed from all. i’m going to have to find an alternative
. report printing and emailing are important to run business on the go. i would like to see qb pro 20072008 features in qbop version and mobile app.
don't be in a hurry. you need to be very aware of what your doing. the user interface can be a little but if a puzzle. otherwise a useful tool.
. very useful when you can't make it into the office
complement to quickbooks online. this app is a complement to quickbooks online. this apple really work good for making estimates sending invoices and much more. i wish gopayment and quickbooks online were integrated or as one. other than that, great app.
fantastic software. a superb help to my business invoicing and payments are so easy to sendview and accept. easy to use and never had a problem.
. fine app. would get 5 stars when i can do inventory
movement through fields. i love the app but it takes so much more time than through safari, enter or tab should move through fields looking forward to this fix
. very good app
cc payment signature window. love the app but, something was changed in one of the recent updates. the screen for the customer to sign to authorize cc payment was made into smaller window. every time you touch it to try and sign, it just moves the window up and down. you can barely make a single line. starting to get frustrating for customers and myself. please address this asap thanks!
. great for my needs to do estimates and invoices in the field.
new version problems. ever since the last update, i can no longer categorize and add income and expense from the app. it seems the buttons to “add” do not work.
not bad. pretty nice app. went from desktop manufacturing to quickbooks online. i like having access to my books while at craft fairs and being able to use different devices. still needs some work  it's been weeks and my gopayment account is still not linked and now find out the online doesn't acceptrecognize the chip reader. square app is more robust and may use that instead. also would be helpful to have a mileage tracker.
happy with the app. i’ve used for quickbooks and the app for a year now and it has really helped my business and is a easy way to keep track of customers and quotes
. doesn't really do much in the big quickbooks picture
. pathetic when it cimeys to app. never gives real time update. often can't refresh. a big no
garbage update. please test all your updates before releasing them to paying clients!!! invoicing issues, client search issues, expense issues, wth!!!
. amazing. intuitive. simple to use. love it.
. very useful and easy to use
. awesome app
ok. updates updates and more updates. what’s worse, arriving to a job site and it updating over the cellular network while a customer waits for me to invoice them. no update and it will not work. the concept and functionality is fine.
amazing in app and on line. the perfect accounting platform. easy to use, fast and simple.
outstanding. very user friendly app. like nothing you have seen in accounting. the future is here.
. doesn't have a way to track milage like qb self employed. we pay more money and get less features. qb is more concerned about segmenting the market to make more money than providing the best products. beware of qb scams and desire to gouge your pocket book.
not for indian. please do remember this app is not useful for indian currency so don't waste your data.
perfect for first time small business owners. maintaining all the records for a construction company can be intimidating; quickbooks has made it less stressful and easier to do my job!
bad customer services to cancel. struggling to get the right information on how to cancel before getting charged as i'm using other software now. been contacted twice with the wrong info.
. the app doesnt refresh my inventory or reports as the update is done via the app or the website
. there is a lack of flexibility. it seems like the app was modeled with a streamlined appraoch to limited process. maybe over a few business' but i am used to more flexibility that you would expect in an app like quickbooks but isn't.
. downloading problems and unresponsive customer service
expenses are easy to track. simple way to track expenses when out and about
great product. i used the desktop version for windows for years and love it but with this it is so much easier and faster and i'm in love with the online version!!!!!
easy to use. this app is so quick and easy. my business is on the go all of the time and it makes estimates and invoicing so quick and easy.
". was a good app. now it will not exit upon entering an expense. upon entering all the info and clicking ""save"" it stays on the same screen. if you hit save 5 times thinking it's not working it saves the expense 5 times. you have to back out and click don't save the transaction but it will be there. intuit  please fix it."
awesome app. i waited to rate this app because i knew eventually everything was going to be available on the mobile app. this makes my job so much easier start to finish.
changed my life..!. qbo has made the bookkeeping side of my business a dream. it has given me so much time back. if i forget the rest my business to run as smoothly, i would be a happy man…
avoid like the plague!. app doesn't work, says trial expired. customer support are unhelpful and have no idea when it will be fixed. we have a years worth of books on this and now we need to find new software  we've been in business for more than 26 years and have never known service like this. seriously, find another solution. this is not the software you are looking for.
beware!. beware quickbooks is not software it’s ransomware. they force you to upgrade every two years and the price of the upgrade is the same price as a new one.
. since adding 3rd party, quickbooks has locked its own app from being able to communicate or work properly with it self. re installed 4 times. have 3 deposits top collect today and no way to record them. all for several thousand dollars. useless application... costing me money...
app crashes in ios 13 & 13.1 .. app crashes in ios 13 & 13.1 . customer service had no clue
formidable. l’arrivée de quickbooks en france a été une grande joie. enfin un logiciel tout en un, facile d’utilisation et efficace.
. brilliant app excellent app. could do more but does enough. better than rest out there but not the best it could be.
. i use to love quickbooks but now it's not working anymore. please fix immediately because my whole business is run on this app... are you gonna fix this?
junk. this app is an embarrassment to use. doesn't attach correct to emails, rude default email tags, and prints too light to fax. i used qb contractor for 10 years before being talked into ipad by apple as the way to go mobile. save your money do things right. this freezes up a lot too which if you have time to wait may be for you.
great for small businesses. easy to use and track expenses, and income so when you get ready to file your taxes you have everything you need at your fingertips.
. this software is superb for business owners but need some customization in product and services option they should provide stock quantities in app and also purchase invoice with itemised discounts option should provided in app
good for viewing, not for editing. can't seem to figure out how to allocate new transactions.
. cool great app
good. excellent app. some very slight issues with layout and the occasional page that can't be used on ipad. but overall good. would recommend to others
. like the app. interface is great. would like to see an charge option for customers, so i can tally up customer's account over the course of a month and bill at the end for my lawn care business.
. horrible. difficulty in getting customer service rep. when asked to speak to a manager she continued to argue. not easy to speak to a rep. i signed in and went thru steps to set up quick books it didn't like my information to deposit money. horrible and don't advise wasting money. sat on hold for a manager for an extremely long time more than 15 minutes.
my expectations of quick books.. i would expect the quick books would gave been able to give me a complete overview of my accounts and businesses. e.g. i can't find anywhere in the program where i can print my company's balance sheet or my company's profit and loss accounts, to name a few. why is this so?
". only works half the time i use it, it's always ""experiencing technical difficulties"""
amazing in app and on line. the perfect accounting platform. easy to use, fast and simple.
. quickbooks technical support is very bad and technical support dont know about how to customised form of bill and showing in their theam but donot show in my bill how to solve it thay don't know ..... and my network speed is 5mbps but opening quick books need time 10  20 minutes to open ... i don't recommend any one for supscription or purchase .... this is a overall very slow software
nice app but not fixing known issues. this is a really good app and i would give it five stars except i keep getting an error message when opening up certain accounts from the chart of accounts. this has been going on for months and quickbooks knows about it and doesn't fix it.
awesome app. as a small business owner i'm constantly on the go. this app is amazing. with very little effort i can quickly add a new client create an invoice and get paid how i want.
very happy. i changed from myob to intuit and my only complant is i wish i did it years ago.
app, subscription. cannot updat subscription gives error on can’t upload data, now expired, very frustrating need solution
just what i needed. i run a small contractor business doing remodel work. the mobile app has been a godsend. i can track all my estimates, invoices & expenses in one place. helps me track clients that are late payers too (which sometimes happens). i like it. 100% worth the subscription
still needs some changes. multiple addresses for a company is still a drama as it changes all previous invoices and quotes. plus ipad app continually won't save edited quotes. have to use desktop version to edit invoices or quotes successfully. annoying!
awesome.. works great for invoicing and reports. love being able to email and print invoices and estimates from my phone. i don't use it for payroll.
quickbooks. great app tool.
. they want nothing more than taking your money! wouldn't refund a $10 purchase when they couldn't transfer my subscription to the correct company file. i had a duplicate company file setup during my online migration, which according to support happens often.
discussed. app would not download after several tries.
awesome. amazing app perfect
where is the payroll functionality?!?!. the app seems to intentionally not include payroll functionality, that’s what i need most! f
". app for android stinks. only loads a few visible parts and if you try to update an invoice, originally entered on the desktop, it will ""zero out"" the parts not found on the app (causing invoicing discrepancies). ayou also can't upload attachments to invoices (which i use frequently in my business). until intuit can make their app consistent with the desktop version it is unusable for mobility."
take me back. new updates are awful. keeps crashing..unable to do simple functions on the go such as editing invoice, sending a statement, etc. old version was much better. change it back to how it was..not every update is a good update. especially not this one.
. i though it would be difficult. once it's set up, it's a breeze. the importing of bank transactions really makes things easier.
no employee support. this app doesn't allow you to do anything unless your account is the owner of the books you are looking at. i was added to the subscription but upon logging into the app was told i had no subscriptions. also unable to use my browser as mobile support doesn't exist for the website and they take it a step further by detecting you are using a phone a blocking you from a non mobile version of the site. very disappointing.
. very helpful with running a small business. tech support is amazing!
brilliant mobile app. it has changed my life . i am able to do quotes in the run and save so much valuable time .
. this app not work in my phone .i am opening this the screen is black.i am purchased 1 year subscription in last two days back.
. best app i've ever used for my small business and i've tried others out there in this was probably one of the best.
great app. i've been a qb user since the early 90's. the app keeps getting better with greater functionally. i'm confident that all functions will be available on the app in future release. i use this app all day to create estimates and bill customers. it's great.
some what happy. quick book is useful however, it's use is not as user friendly as it could be. the extra time it takes for me to have to identify items and upload others takes up more than i care to.
love it.. i love this app it is very convenient and works so nice when i'm on the run for quick access
. i was asked to update which i did and now it won't open
. needs the employee menu... i like this app and its convenient and all but there's no reason a simple function like the employee menu shouldn't be on it
incredibly glitchy. the app is glitchy despite updates. i’m not super impressed by intuit in general. i use their payroll for my business, a lot of glitches there too. app crashes or spontaneously exits my selections to “accept” for no reason and i have to start over. does not learn well, i have to reteach things over and over.
easy to use. i have been using qb for almost 3 years now and have had nothing but good things to say about the service provided. the support has been great anytime i needed it, they were johnny on the spot. i would highly recommend this to any small business that wants to take the stress out of bookkeeping.
. using a samsung note edge: cannot update estimates at all. been using this app for months and it constantly locks up and crashes.
great app but sign in issues. wont let me sign in anymore keeps sayin error restart app.
. mobile invoicing, categorizing expenses, pandl, ect. powerful. get it to save money and sky rocket efficiency in business. sooo good!
. they have stop me for using the software and didn't tell me why.
pretty basic and useless. can't do a lot of things. it's very very basic , pretty much a basic overview of your account. you can’t do anything even as detailed as seeing the transactions in a pl report. it’s only broad overview stuff and entering new transactions. can’t even switch cash vs accrual. severely limited and cannot work in a pinch when you can’t use an actual computer.
. very good online accounting software .please update with reports for android version.
just need it to be reliable, that’s it. simply just opening the app and signing in is more trouble than needed in some days. qb has everything i need already. i’d rather have bank connections, signing in, viewing basic info, and all the basics work flawlessly than anything else.
always crashes and says critical updates are needed.. constantly crashing. new photo software sucks. can barely recognize the edge of a receipt against a black backround. have to edit every single photo.
cannot hours for. it verified my account by text message, and had my phone number on file on my account. won't let me use it because i don't have an account..?
easy to edit invoice. was happy to be able to edit an invoice on the fly without the need to be in the office to log onto the computer to do so!
. my accountant said everything going digital. use this on lap top no problem. but it wont even open on my phone! not great when out and about trying to get payments in while running a business! oh and paying for this... service?? not happy
can't get anything!. i use qb at home and this app does not bring up any information that is needed. very frustrating when on the go. please fix!!!
perfect app. perfect app
. great app, simple to use, alot of resources.
rubbish. absolutely rubbish since the last update . keeps crashing on iphone xr. screen message = app needs to close due to critical updates. happens 2030 x times a day when trying to set up an invoice estimate etc. test your updates before release you them, you idiots!
like the app. just hope it would be easier to use need better access to my custumers invoice and estimates
great for business. it's great that you can send invoices from phone. it would be even greater if it had a deposit feature. that way when you're at the bank you can just look on the app and see and check off your deposits from undeposited funds.
great. love this app. some glitches but overall great.
. no1 app
amazing. this is so much easier to use and access. we are out in the field more time than at the office and to be able to email am invoice to a customer in front of him is awesome.
password paste does not work. i use a pw management tool and can no longer paste it into the app. this is really annoying as my password is totally random and 15 characters long!!!
. just the request for this app. i want to use it in my mobile also.
app servicer. qbo needs more reporting capacity.
game changer. been using the desktop version for over a decade. now that i’m using qbo along with the mobile app i feel like i have been living in the dark ages! this is simple, useful, powerful and most importantly convenient! no more keeping up with paper receipts and forgetting to keep track of purchases.
intelligent design. it's easy to use in any form either on your computer your phone or your mobile tablet, make your job easier
doesn’t mirror quickbooks online. it’s good for looking up customer info like what they owe or phone numbers. if you create an invoice online you may not be able to edit it on the phone. and if you use quickbooks for time tracking the feature doesn’t seem to be in the cards for the mobile app.
great app.. great app
ease!. makes likes easy as i'm out with clients, i can look up their invoices quickly and get information fast. user friendly. sometimes better than using the web version.
useless out in the field can't work off line. useless out in the field can't work off line and constantly wants you to refresh data. does not support star portable printers. waist of space on cell phone gave it a second try useless creating a invoice have to use search window to find items. had to go use desktop instead of my ipad pro because would of took all night to do a invoice.
amazing app when it works. haven’t been able to use this app as of late because i use a password manager and the quickbooks app stopped allowing me to paste my password into the password field at login. tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, still didn’t work. this issue has to be fixed.
terrible support. the feature that you promote in your advertisement for this app shows a person recording his receipts wich mainly are cash or card paid. the options that you have as type of payments are cheque, credit or other. nobody this days pay by cheque or by credit receipts for small amounts!!!! totally useless!!!
great product. i love using the cloud version of this software to make my business more streamlined
. needs lots of work yet. it's not fullfunction, and lists with subelements are totally useless. now that qboe is more tabletready, skip this app and go straight to qboe.intuit.com with your favorite browser.
what did you do?. after the update today i can no longer enter pavements? and my ipad version no longer syncs with my updated info from my phone?! fix it!!!!
crashes. app crashes every time i'm using a lg g5 emailed support for help 3 weeks ago no response.sent response never heard back.
. i have been using this app for 6 months. $40 subscription doesn't get me receipt capture, but the $10 subscription gets it... cannot get it to save information once i enter it, tells me to call a support line that seemingly cannot help me.
affordable truck repair inc.. great app, makes it very easy for us to keep track of our books.
iphone app is the worst. the iphone app doesn't work. their customer service people admitted it doesn't work. don't even try to use it  too frustrating and a big waste of time. online version and ipad versions are good but too limited for price  reports can't compare year over year
great. easy estimate, signing, invoicing process.
mick's mowing & gardening. great app very easy to use and very helpful to my business
avoid merchant service. avoid at all cost the merchant services. they preapprove you and then hold on your money for a month before forcing you to refund each transaction you processed with them. i had to call 6 times 1 hour each time and it is still not fixed. they are still holding the funds and it’s been more than a full month. terrible customer service.
limited functionalty. the app has limited functionality, can't see transaction details of any expenses and income accounts; can only see the assets and was told to use the browser version. can't drill down from a report to see the details of the transactions. touch id login is handy. so it's better to just use the browser version.
not working!!!!!. i've had this program for a year and it's not working today!!! i can't accept edit or accept credit card payments.... argh!!
". you broke the app!!! can't attach pdfs to invoices anymore!!! it litteraly worked yesterday, and today a ""new"" interface. make a deal with adobe and fix it now!!! update no your solution doesn't help. i already new i could do this on the desktop version. app is still broken and your proposed solution is just as useless as you have rendered your app. fix it"
reduced feature set. need to have timesheet function put into app! please!! also, the separation of vendor mtce from vendor transactions is opposite of the web interface. same for customers.
awesome app. simple, clean. just need the banking feed for the android in canada please!
. clunky, ugly app with barely any features. there's no way to refresh your banking data within the app, though navigation and ux is so awful i maybe just can't find it. no consistent design standard throughout with multiple different menu types, navigation styles, presentation. almost no graphics, just pages of text. invoicing, expenses and tracking are all so horrible i'm forced to use the (also underwhelming) browser version. how did this pass quality control?
works well. this app is far better than the desk top program for mac. as a small business i have many more things i need to do than spending time learning a program. it allows easy access for my accountant and mobility for me!
mobile vs desktop. i see no reason the same features can’t be provided in the mobile app as the desktop interface.
. ok. new version is better, but still lacks supplier feature. good for easy transaction...have to use web for more complicated stuff. good app! no complaints other that it obviously ment for the simpler side of the accounting management equation. good design, have high hopes for more features in the future.
app is almost useless for me.. the only reason i upgraded to quickbooks on line was so that i could do estimates and invoicing on site. this app will allow me to do an estimate but will not let me do a partial invoice. if i can’t do a partial invoice on the app it’s simply a waste of time for my small fencing business.
. the app is currently not working as i cannot login for the last few days. i can login to their website so it's just the app. i have sent the error log a few times and still no fix. i have deleted the app and redownloaded still no luck.
easy to use. makes accountingonthego very easy for our business. also is very easy to understand how to enterprocess all information.
. awesome app..
. i love how this apps keeps me and all my expenditures, finances and all in check. extremely handy for my small business!
qb makes me look good. qb app is fantastic. i can write and present an estimate right at the job site or give my customer an invoice, or accept payment. in brief....it makes me look good!
good app!. i like the app. it let's me run quick books from my phone (gs5) in the field and it runs smoothly. doing estimates on site is great.
useless since update. the last update brings a gorgeous splash screen. i know this because i see it dozens of times each day since i have to log in every time i open the app! completely useless now.
. just made my life so much easier.
still slow & buggy. home page shows update date as current and. transactions to reconcile yet when i go to the individual accounts to do it the numbers are either wrong or transactions not there...
. mobile app needs some more work
great app!¡. im always on the go and this app is great when invoiceestimate has to be sent immediately or when there is no computer access¡¡ highly recommended for biz on the go!!
i also should have read the reviews. i only use my quickbooks to track expenses and deposits due to the nature of my business. i have been trying to use the mobile version of this program now, after being on the pc version for over 10 years, and still cannot find a way to log my deposits. i can accept payments for invoices, which i do not use for the majority of my business but cannot enter a straight deposit.
keeps crashing. keeps crashing and doesn't track mileage for work and charity. really disappointing.
really frustrating app. very frustrating app both on iphone and qbo. very glitchy and customer support is terrible. if the they didn't force you to use a subscriptionbased model, i'd use the installable version on quickbooks. i'm sure other have less problems, but it has not been a good experience for myself or my company.
simply the best. simple and easy to understand and use. above all, the free technical support is out of this world. go for it, you cannot go wrong.
. app still sucks. just had to uninstall and reinstall again. happens about every 4 months.
. worst app ever. unsubscribed after week as the app wasn't what i needed. charged anyway after unsubscribe. tried to reach customer service by chat, the chat keeps disappearing until the moment that doesn't work at all. horrible
. i had an issue that didnt get resolved so i deactivated my account and still getting charged after.
not bad. convenient app. not as functional as quickbooks online, but it adds to its subscription's value.
". would give 5 stars if i could put a message on an invoice or estimate; like ""work location"""
a1. great saves money time talks to my accountant, does estimates, converts to invoice simple
app crashes ughhh. app crashes after you sign in. please fix!
. so user friendly
crashes a ton. this is a great app for bookkeeping for my business, but it crashes almost daily on my iphone. please get better engineers for the functionality of this app!! so frustrating when i’m in the middle of printing invoices and the app crashes! how am i supposed to conduct business that way!?!
. it's been years and the login still fails 80% of the time. have to clear data in the app just to login. it's a nightmare.
can't save my invoices!. my app auto updated. now i can't save my invoices on the go. i use this app all day, 6 days a week. i'm in the home services industry and i can no longer invoice my clients, which means i can't collect payment either! get this fixed!
simple but professional. i could just learn most of it by myself, at least for my small nonprofit organizational needs. but would like to see more nonprofit features in the mobile version as well!
fix it. quit making me sign in again and telling me my session expired.. there are multiple safety factors already in place that should allow me to open my app and go to work
. nice app
need some updates please. the app is good fir me and easy to use .. i would like to insert in settings options to automatically change the color of the invoices every 15 20 days .let say when the invoice goes 15 days old to automatically change in yellow ,then when is 30 days orange ,45days old red and on and on and on :) ;)
disappointed. i work a lot with the browser version of qbo which is really excellent. unfortunately, the ipad version is far from good... when we talk about cloudconnected application, i expect to have the same functionalities whatever is the system used. wrong design...
. awesome app.
statements. wish i could send statements from the app. i do love the convenience of the app!
not good support. the app is ok, but if you require support, it is not there.
can't do much. among other things, you can't enter billable time. this would be my main use for this app.
great app!. very useful, but i think it still needs some work. very limited, need to offer more functions.
. lacking abundantly completely unprofessional, there's about 5 options, you can't even put together an invoice that you could realistically give to a customer. i'm very very disappointed.
excellent app. keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
fantastic features. all the features that works under this single app. i used to work with excel spreadsheet, invoice app, expense app to complete the business on the go. now everything has being simplify into this one subscription saving me time and double entry. i am absolutely happy that i can email invoice, take pictures and enter expense using my iphone. best of all these is update into the cloud. great excellent accounting software nothing comes close after trying others accounting software.
review this, quickbooks. i was using the app on my ipad, and kept getting a notice to ‘submit a review’. only choice was ‘ not now ‘ . after every transaction, after every page change, the message came up to ‘submit a review’ i pay a monthly subscription, stop bugging me. here’s your review.
can't do much. you can't pay bills, enter bills, or do almost anything that i do on a daily basis on my computer. the app is nice looking but useless for anything i need to do besides check my balance.
pretty basic and useless. can't do a lot of things. it's very very basic , pretty much a basic overview of your account. you can’t do anything even as detailed as seeing the transactions in a pl report. it’s only broad overview stuff and entering new transactions. can’t even switch cash vs accrual. severely limited and cannot work in a pinch when you can’t use an actual computer.
. won't send invoices to customers, complete waste of time and money would not recommend to anybody.
. just makes life so easy and simple to use once set up
app crashes. this app crashes or cannot save my data on every entry i make. horrible app!!
i am discussed with your country list. you have palestine listed. it is not even a country. israel is where i live. i will be blasting this all over the web and deleting this app from my phone. thank you for your reply but again, palestine does not exist. it hasn't since 1948
so much better than sage. we moved from sage to this and haven’t looked back. the app is better and the links to banks work (unlike sage). the help and support is better than sage too. all in all, well worth a trial.
. many bugs, and any receipt photos are too low resolution to be readable.
great for my business. i use it to keep track of my customers. if i am not at my desk top computer, i still can let them know about their order.
. awesome app for small or big business owners that have a lot of paperwork customers etc
. complete app for business
. very good app. make invoices in a snap.
. app doesn't have all features, as we have it in web application.
. very slow. app doesnt update automatically. i have to manually update which takes forever for a relatively small number of changes to be downloaded. quite disappointed with it.
. it's great to send invoices and estimates through email from my phone
help with my subscription. it says error downloading product information
. this app has been helping me manage my business much better than before
great for my business. this app has been an absolute vital part in helping me run my business. i love it!
an accountancy company that cant keep track of its accounts.. when it was time to subscribe intuit had a problem recognising the i tunes payment and could do nothing to resolve the problem , the told me the only solution was to pay them direct and start a new account thus losing all of my data in the process with no guarantee it won’t happen again , mr m ship was particularly useful in helping me to leave this poor service
still waiting for receipt feature to work. i have made multiple inquiries about the receipt expense feature not working and they haven't even responded let alone fixed the issue. this has been happening for over a year.
fantastic app. easy to use and works very well.
doesn't send invoices. my customers stopped receiving invoices from me via email. i have to send it to myself and forward to them. customer service is a joke: they think their clients are stupid, their advices are just ridiculous: are you sure you put the email in the right section? really? i had been sending invoices via email before and they all received them.
awesome. awesome app! i use it for my landscaping and turf management company.
"fees on fees. while the app itself works and is fairly handy, i strongly advise against quickbooks as a company. i signed on as a business owner for $6.95 a month and was immediately slapped with over $100 in fees hidden in ""fine print"". worse is the utter inability to get any customer support from intuit. i canceled my subscription and despite already paying for the month, lost access immediately and lost all of my records. then i got billed again. stay away."
best business app. very quick, no bugs or errors. love it!!!
quick books. awsome app. helps when your always on the go.
not able to login. never download this app. i have reported this error many times to the quickbooks support team. till this date they haven't even just looked into this issue.
. really quick and simple set up. easy to use. no problems so far. perfect for a small business.
. great for on the go, syncs with pc version, keeps my business going as long as there's wifi or cel service, since i work in places with spotty coverage. being able to email invoices and changes on the spot is very helpful.
need some updates please. the app is good fir me and easy to use .. i would like to insert in settings options to automatically change the color of the invoices every 15 20 days .let say when the invoice goes 15 days old to automatically change in yellow ,then when is 30 days orange ,45days old red and on and on and on :) ;)
easy to use. love this app, easy to use.
quick books app. absolutely love this app, its works fabulously well on my iphone. my only gripe with the app and it's operations is that not all of my customer emails that are sent are being received by my customers. i have highlighted this to quickbooks and they were extremely unhelpful in assisting with rectifying this matter, which i found extremely disappointed given this is a paid subscription service, and not a free service.
not pleased. for one i still can't redownload the app after i accidentally deleted it. it's been months. i hit the cloud button and it does nothing. i also put an estimate in and the phone didn't save it. when i checked desktop it was saved 6x because i kept trying to do it on the phone. the app has many glitches but it is helpful when i'm not by a computer but u cannot rely solely on the app.
business on the run. quickbooks online with the ios app make operating a travel based business on the run simple. log invoices as you go. input estimates along the way. print and mail or email all at once at the end of the day. not to mention the helpful reports and expense management. i couldn't run my business without it.
was great and then they updated it. i loved this app when i first got it. i used it all the time for 5 months strait, and then they 'updated' it. now, it's awful. i don't see any of the new features and it is buggy beyond belief. please go back to the older version. this is a joke.
easy to use. good layout but would be really useful if the suppliers element was added
on job usage. so easy to access invoices and job costing on the job site so easy to make my life easier
. great app but...... love this app. my only request is that they add the ability to do banking like recording deposits.
no american express support. we use american express for expenses and we cannot manage these transactions within the app. not even see them. the app tells me to view quickbooks online in a web browser to manage amex transactions. this makes this app very useless.
quickbooks online. the application what ever so far developed is 55. (smooth, easy to use, great ui design). but there are many existing features missing between web and app. an by quickbooks online itself can have lot more basic features which is available in many other pos softwares to manage a firm. your updates are very minimal or nothing. developments are slow!! support team is reactions fast for the queries (just reacting) but no solution for problems or no concrete answers for new feature request.
easily the worst app on ios. this is the single worst and buggiest app on the app store. it is buggy, gives random permissions errors, and generally fails to get the job done.
can not do custom invoice numbers. the app can not do custom invoice numbers. i have had the app for two months and paying the monthly fees and have not been able to send out my first proper invoice. i have asked support and they come back with instructions to go to certain settings that do not exist on the app.
emailing invoices. this is an excellent app for tracking income and expenses. however, whenever i try to email invoices, it gives an error message that it is 'unable to send message'. will give five stars if this issue is worked out.
it gets better and better. i was a huge sceptic (i have been a pro advisor for several years)and very had a very negative opinion of qb online. that was until a couple of years ago when i attended a presentation of the capabilities of the software. i was sold on its usefulness and have been using and recommending it ever since. qb online adds important features regularly. buy it!!! you won't be disappointed
latest update is garbage. update: 1620 still a garbage app even after multiple emails back and forth with quickbooks development team and now it’s been weeks since i heard from them the app still don’t work even after new updates app has been great up until 3 weeks ago now it no longer works! crashes every time i try to open the app.
beware of this service. i was told today by their rep that they are a very small business and they are not prepared to handle medium to large business’ transactions. after we have made the switch and spent so much time converting everything over and using their service we were told that they only want to handle a small portion of transactions. ugh.
making my job easier. more than i expected and easy to use
nice but crashes. i like the app other than the fact that after a few minutes of work it crashes. it reliably crashes. helpfully they fix it soon, it's frustrating to have to log back in every time.
great accounting software. perfect for small business owners with less knowledge of the accounting world. very user friendly.
. great for me. the ipad and android versions are awesome for on the go.
useless for bookkeep. cannot access chart of accounts or bank accounts so i can not enter checks or payments. this is of no use to my business. so disappointing!
. doesnt always load, have to un install and re install every other day
simple. makes my life simpler. bottom line. easy to navigate. easy input. i prefer the mobile app over the website. i wish that u could set default categories for vendors, such as reliant defaults to utilities.
. i've used quickbooks since starting my own business, plastering, it is very useful, but also very hard to understand and navigate. loads of features you can use, if you can find the information or spend ages trying to find and work it all out. hardly any help. easily take your money every month, but i am struggling to resubscribe!! does all my info disappear now! the time i've spent on this and the money, so misleading, very frustrated with quickbooks at the moment!
can’t attach existing photo with ios13. with ios 13 you cannot upload an existing photo to a new expense. when you select a photo, the app freezes and there’s no button to accept the photo.
. emailed 3 times now would be nice to get a reply as would like a refund due to canceling my subscription in the first 30day free trial but have still been charged for it.
no longer works on ipad. this app is no longer functioning as of the most recent update. it used to work on the ipad. the camera feature is difficult to use when trying to take a picture of receipt. it doesn't allow me to record payments any longer. please fix.
". signed up, gave cc info, created account, password etc. system then froze, gave me no confirmations and started billing me. spoke with the ""chat help"" which is people who can't spell common words or understand english. they were unable to cancel my account. now i have to through mastercard to get my money back. thank god my business is not dependent on this ancient software."
touch id and pin not working. i down loaded the update; the update was suppose to help improve touch id and the pin. however, now bone of them work and i have to sign in every time. i tried it on my iphone and ipad neither work. disappointing
"please include timekeeping features.. this app is essentially a ""readonly"" feature of the real online experience for me. after the first couple of days orienting myself to the app, i've given up. please include timekeeping feature. thank you."
"great app for distributors. we can invoice and deliver on the fly without having to go back to the office to capture the ""in the moment sales"". our accountant has access and was able to set our account up to match his categories for a fast and no worry tax prep."
. great app!
app freezes. since updating my iphone to 13.0 the quickbooks app freezes once it opens. at this point it is completely useless.
plenty to be desired. there are options such as making expenses billable is not available. previously had issues with adjusting tax in the app and the support team told me to use the web based version. what's the point in having an app with features when the support team just tells you use the web version.
struggle. guys i've been struggling to log in onto this app from my galaxy s6 for several weeks now, i'm considering switching to another provider. please fix this bug. ive tried for hours at a time, everytime it asks me if i am a robot, but it never logs in just hours of saying signign in. the whole point of having this app is being able to do stuff on the go and right now thats not working...
great app. only thing i don’t like is if you accidentally delete an invoice you can never get that invoice number back and it’s now been voided. that needs to be fixed so it can be adjusted or recovered. none the less it’s a great app. won’t ever connect my bank info none the less because that’s how you get audited for nothing.
. i'm not sure about the functionality of this app, i was unwilling to continue trying to learn it because of a particularly bad customer service experience. i caught the guy speaking with me in a blatant lie while he was trying to charge me a large amount of money for a problem he couldn't explain.
too expensive. would give it 5 stars if it was cheaper $20 for just invoices give me a break
. currently unable to use. logging in on a huawei tablet the app crashes whenever i click on the banking tab as accountant login
. really friendly and useful
. great app use it to submit all quotes and review estimates
. would love to know how this app works but as soon as i open it... it crashes. if you guys fix it ill adjust my review. but until then. you suck
a great start 5 stars once more features released. i remember when i used to hate quickbooks and especially their phone support. things very different now. i think freshbooks has set a standard in customer service that quickbooks is trying to match. the result? both firms offer first class tech support with freshbooks having the edge in ease of use but quickbooks offering more features. well done quickbooks huge improvement.
. would love to know how this app works but as soon as i open it... it crashes. if you guys fix it ill adjust my review. but until then. you suck. all fixed. awesome work!!!!!
logo. this is a great mobile app but i wish you could put your own logo on the invoices.
app constantly glitches and it's very slow. i've had so many issues with this app. lately it has been extremely slow, it randomly shuts down for no reason in the middle of inputting a transaction and it won't load larger invoices. i'm very disappointed as i use this on a daily basis for my business.
worst app update. after updating the recently, app is crashing. unable to login
. i am very pleased with this app
great app. super friendly and sweet app
. it does the job.support is good!
. i love the freedom that qbook gives me with the online version i can work at any place out side of the office.. also update are free and there free support team are the best. thanks so much qbook for be there for my business and me..
good so far. i'm new to this app. seems to work good so far. if it changes or if i can suggest something i will when i know more.
. wish i understood it better . great software . easy to use. wish i was computer and book keeping smarter.
"locks, freezes, and won't sync. updated last week and haven't been able to use it since. i've reinstalled, cleared cache, resynced data... nothing. qb customer service ""can't see any issues with my login"" so who knows ? ive been reduced to entering all my invoices from my computer at home (defeats the purpose of the app doesn't it?). until they fix this update, don't download it."
. waist of time app. does what it wants not what you want. worthless
spam generator. don't get involved with intuit. they're stalkers. whatever utility the app has is outweighed by the spam
. this apo no longer works. i cannot make invoices, sales receipts, etc. i called quickbooks and they said there is nothing they could do. i have a mobile business and relied on this app, now it's useless.
. quick books online is perfect for a small business owner like myself. i can have a professional bookkeeping,payroll, and tax service with also being able to provide estimates and invoices out in the field. its perfect!! thanks so much much quick books. trey blocker blocket tree service
perfect for small businesses!. i have a growing cleaning company and thus app is perfect for me!
useless. all i want is to do, while i am out and about, is enter my expenses and take a pic of the receipt and sync it. not even close to happening with this app.
useful but slow. quickbooks online in general is useful for sending out invoices and estimates on the go, going through expenses, etc... however the platform can be fairly slow and sometimes glitchy.
don’t update. ever since last update it crashes when i try to run a credit card. was talking with customer support for an hour and all she could say is i understand. when i asked to speak to a manager the line was disconnected
used for many years but. intuit is increasing the price of quickbooks by 25% the next billing period. the app doesn’t support key functions that you can access online, for example adding multiple email addresses to one invoice.
awesome product. general contractor have tried a lot of different apps and have spent a few hundred bucks...this one by far is the best for invoicing and providing estimates. very streamlined and quick to learn..
excellent. the app is a great supplement to the online version when i'm on the road. i easily make customer invoices, add expenses that i have purchased. nothing is lost or forgotten. great way to keep everything up to date
. doesn't sync like it should, does not allow you to specify deposits. frustrating. the guy with support even told me to not use it.
. runs our business so much smoother for since app was created.
great app. i love quickbooks online as well as the mobile application for iphone and ipad. i basically run my business from my tablet and smart phone. we truly are living in the future.
love this app. qbo is indispensable in running my business.
. great software!!
awesome. the app provides an excellent opportunity to update all expenditures to find out exactly what's in my bank account anywhere i have signal for my phone.
good app. vendors application must be updated.
. there are a few features that arent available on the app (only computer) but other than that it works great and is easy to navigate.
new to business and this is great. i have now completed my second year running my business and without a doubt i owe some of my success to quickbooks as i don't have an admin person it helps me manage things also creates the professional image i need. i prefer using the web platform but when i am on the go and making small purchases for clients i love to add the expenses to their invoice on my phone before i forget!
still needs some changes. multiple addresses for a company is still a drama as it changes all pervious invoices and quotes. plus now on the ipad version it says i can't access until subscription is paid but it is.. works on computer but can't use my ipad. annoying!!!
awesome app. i run a small business and i use quick books to manage my entire business! from estimates to invoices to getting paid its all so easy and fun to use! thanks guys
useless staff. staff are useless and argumentative charged twice in 1 month over the price agreed then the argue it’s my fault literally like talking to a brick wall use free agent it’s free and just as good
excellent app. i am a accountant and this is excellent
. great app for individual
easy to use, plenty of features. pretty good value for an entire business accounting, sales and inventory app, cloud based as well so can be accessed from anywhere.
everything i hoped & more. we switched to quickbooks with the hope of having a quicker, easier and more efficient way to keep our books. it is everything we hoped for and more. i love ability to go paperless on delivery tickets, signatures and po's. all of which can be done paperless. greg nees, owner cisco tool, inc.
. great app
great when working. this app is a great app , however every time that apple do an update it seems to cause issue in regards to the program recognising that you have a up to date subscription
love it.. i love this app. easy to use and is pretty reliable within little downtime. however i would like more options like inclusion of sku numbers and the ability to pay for subscriptions within the app.
pretty good but, but no bill entry????. i have found this to be somewhat helpful for reviewing expenses, but it would be fantastic if i was able to pay bills on the go. i would love to be able to keep my business mobile by using the camera to “scan” invoices and submit them for payment right from the app. a core function that is surprisingly absent. this is a must for future development. without it, the app just come up short...
crashing after ios13 update!. app is crashing after face id log in on xs max ios13
ouickbooks. setting up this quickbooks app is a joke , the system does not work and customer support has an attitude that is not willing to help!
the best software. this software is just great
bank transfers take too long. i am very frustrated. it has been 1 week since my clients paid their invoice and the money still is not in my bank account after 1 week. unacceptable!
. qbo much improved over original launch product, and tge app has brought qbo up.to date. i love the ability to upload receipts tgat immediately sync with qbo and match to vendorsexpenses. qbos ability to have multiple ysrs working simultaneously is huge . realtime collaboration with my bookkeeper and accountant is now easy. no more thirdparty file sharing apps and concerns about version control. with the app i can now monitor financials on the fly. highly recommend!
great app!. i am not an accountant nor have i ever been interested in kreping the books! quick books online is an awesone tool that simplifies and centralizes the job of running the finances of a business. i thoroughly enjoy the interface and actually look forward tonentering data and running reports! eric
keep logging me out. after the update the application keeps logging me out every single time please fix that, used to do it with the previous update before this last one, you guys fixed it, but with this new update is doing it again
very happy. this app makes my accounting work super easy, can't wait for all features to be available on the app.
. loads, then crashes. uninstalled and reinstalled, and still crashes upon open. fingerprint doesn't work anymore. frustrating.
very disappointed. i'm very disappointed because i have been unable to login on with my iphone or macbook pro. i tried to get help through customer service but all i got was a link. very disappointed!!
newest update is nothing but problems. can no longer update estimates. freezes and have to close app. also cannot see new estimates fellow employees have created. app ran perfectly prior to the update. intuit needs to launch new update asap or they are losing my business.
invoices don’t look great. the issue i had when using quickbooks was the invoices just didn’t look very polished or professional. there’s a way of setting up a custom invoice, but really you want a good default so you don’t have to muck around.
. very disappointed, missing 6 months of transactions from my bank, tried to fix it as i was instructed to but couldn't, you can't get someone to speak to, no customer service. big joke, i don't recommend it to anyone
mr. a very practical application with absolutely brilliant back up support and service !!!
new update crashes constantly. can’t login. crashed every time. have tried reinstalling without any luck. also, you can’t customize or get payment alerts for qbo except through the app. so until this is fixed, i’m stuck checking daily to see who’s paid and when. pain in the butt. please fix asap.
easy to use. i have been using qb for almost 3 years now and have had nothing but good things to say about the service provided. the support has been great anytime i needed it, they were johnny on the spot. i would highly recommend this to any small business that wants to take the stress out of bookkeeping.
network problems. sometimes it says it has network problems and you have to cancel every data you just put in to try saving again. it can be two or three times that happens and that is really frustrating.
invoice reminder from app. i was hoping to manage my quickbooks account on my ipad like how i use qkb on a laptop, but it seems like on the ipad version it’s missing a lot functionalities, such as invoice reminder to client. also to set up the invoice reminder. can you please improve this in your next update? thanks.
. unable to use your 30 days free demo, downloaded app, when tried logging in, it says app login feature is available for indian users. when try the same in browser, and after logged in when i want to use free trail it is asking for 10$ payment
. makes my small business accounting much easier for me. i can send invoices, quotes and pay bills all from the comfort of my cell when i am on the road between jobs.
very convenient. nice format for creating estimates and invoicing. although, it is frustrating having the keyboard cover the un scrollable typing field on note 4. you must continuously press the back button to view the text.................i just realized i'm having the same issue typing this review. could be the note 4. hmmmmm
convenient. works great. i love that i can keep track and update transactions wherever i am.
small business accounting. very helpful software for my business. has everything from accounting software to expenses, to employee payroll and deductions. has helped me become more efficient with my time. makes estimating and invoicing more streamline.
. really easy to use
. great app once you get logged in. repeatedly returns to login screen after entering correct password when using google login.
"no problems so far. i've only been using for about a week but no issues yet. i do wish qb would add a ""orders"" option that could then be invoiced."
very good. excellent app that syncs with qbo.
app
new and improved. i waited a long time to change over to the online version per the advice of my accountant. it was worth the wait. it's a much better version and easier than the regular version of qb
. really good for simple operations i only needed the app for a small subset of operations.... that is, quickly open,edit, and send an invoice. i am thankful for that capability. perhaps intuit could stress that the app is not intended to be full blast qbo.
. installed on android yesterday. cannot see anything on dashboard. called customer service and they don't know anything about the issue and can't help. she said she can see it on her iphone. account can be seen on desktop version but the mobile app is useless.
salvage yard and towing co. we have used quickbooks for so long i remember uploading the first version into my computer with a stack of 5 12 inch floppy discs. this mobile version is the best. i'm able to see what the days totals are as well as adding sales with my iphone or ipad.
assholes team. if your app doesn't work in india, why did you collect basic data ? this app is just a trap to collect your mobile number, mail id and other basic details.
disappointed. the app on iphone is murch better. this app doesn't enable me to take pictures of recipes. very limited. needs to be more like the iphone app
please add a vital function. need to add bills but can't. how ridiculous to not have this function. adding bank deposits etc. surely it's time to add this to the app. for me it's unusable
why isn't app as easy to use as actual online. the online version is so much easier to navigate. i don't like that the app and the online version have things in different places. it makes it much harder to locate things. i would rather have one streamlined version to use on all devices.
makes my job so much easier. simple enough to use but detailed enough to get the job done.
crashes too much, stressful. doing accounting is difficult enough. why did quickbooks create an app that crashes and creates frustration then?! this is not my phone's problem, because i have the latest apple model.
i haven't used much. i've only updated a few transactions on the app, so far! but all is good as of now. super easy!
great for small business. such a time saver, easy for business owner, accountant and bookkeeper to enter review and lodge bas. love the fact i can take photos of receipts to back them up and also add attachments to invoices etc. such a great software with web access also
love it!!!. i am a tile contractor and use this app everyday. i love the latest update where the customer can sign the estimate.
. doesn't connect to all bank accouns. some of us don't have the opportunity of the standard high street back account due to various issues in our pasts. i have tried to connect a cashplus business account and it isn't supported.
. it's a good app, but much faster on ios than android. it's excruciating to use on android
. it does everything i need it to, customer service is really helpful when you're learning how to use it, and the convenience of accessing your books anywhere anytime is exactly what a busy person needs.
good. nice app
very handy. excellent app love it save me hours in office
longtime user, app is gradually slowing down. been using quickbooks online since it came out, and unfortunately the apps seem to slowing down more and more with each update. i have to delete and reinstall the app a couple times a year because it hangs or acts funky. hope these little issues get resolved and i can use the apps i pay a lot of money each year to use
great app but needs banking. this app is great since the last major update, but all i want now is to do my banking on it too.
ok, room for improvement. quickbooks needs to build in a way to enter time via mobile devices. why have an app for quickbooks for mobile devices if you cannot enter your time in on the fly?
. great app to stay up with your buisness great app
. this is what happens when a company gets too large. first app worked fine and then suddenly refuses to connect to my bank. customer service is a joke. reps were unable to figure out why error 103 kept appearing. after two hours on the phone i was then told it is a systems issue that needs its own ticket. two days later an email arrives stating that the issue is resolved. guess what, it wasn't!! come up intuit! you can do better than this
. no response from tech support does not work on my moto x running 4..2. 2. i have sent email twice with no response.
time saver!. we recently had a glitch with the program in that our quotes and invoices weren't displaying correctly if sent from a tablet. qbo support walked us through the problem and made the changes to the backend templates until it was rectified. invoicing and quoting should never be a burden. we are happy with the outcome.
update issues. i have used this app for years with no operating issues. unfortunately the last two updates have disrupted my business flow. now i can't even open the app. hopefully with the recent price increase intuit will have the resources to figure this out. my rating is based on recent update experiences.
useless. can’t share the online app with my accountant. frustrating and useless!!!!
company owner. you can't go in an manage users unless you have a desktop version that's just not acceptable i have an ipad pro cost 3times what my computer cost it better get fixed or i am gone.very disappointed. also customer service can't help either rg
. love this app. makes tax time so much easier. couldn't be much happier.
. great app. keeps all my business expenses in order.
makes books much easier to keep updated. this is a powerful combination of mobile, camera, and bookkeeping. much easier than relying on the desktop.
o melhor!. excelente!!! minha ferramenta de gestão financeira.
. i love this app.
roofing company. the app is great, although it needs an update with bugs fixed. the app won't allow me to modify, save or send invoices. very frustrating.
. love it!!! works great with the online site, as a business owner this app is very useful.
disappointed. although it loaded up ok, it didn't refresh my data that i had added online. i emailed support who are supposed to reply in 24 hrs but never heard anything. so unless they get this sorted it's going to be deleted.
multiple selection?. hey is it possible to do multiple when using this app on iphone like it’s possible when using my ipad. if not can you make it possible.
meh. constantly making me sign out. constantly not updated with what’s online. constantly telling me i’ve got outstanding invoices that have long. we. recorded online.
. app is crashing. also, when it does log in successfully, it doesn't remember my state from previous login. it needs to downloads stacks of data all over again.
iphone 7. ios 12.2. the app was okay with its limits. but now it won’t even open my company profile.
three years using qbo. very dissatisfied.. bugs and more bugs. slow and clunky functionality. bait and switch pricing. no way to communicate effectively with qbo as they are pro forma all about feedback and customer service however the poor souls tasked with providing it have no two way communication with the people who actually code this bug ridden system. i am actively looking for other solutions that provide ipad and iphone data entry.
. i love this app. anyone with a small business should have this!
. recent updates have greatly improved this app! it used to be hard to switch back to it if you opened another app, but that's now fixed. i love being able to invoice customers right away, record an expense (along with a photo of the receipt) and take a payment.
great way to get my money in and estimates out.. really happy quickbooks enables me to work anywhere creating on the spot estimates and invoices making my cash flow work better for me. great app
horrible since last update. constantly crashes and slow to load. not to mention we are paying almost $800 a year to use this crappy program. lacks many features the desktop version has.
design and functionality is poor. the pin code doesn't work. i have to refresh data most of the time. crashes a few times a week. trying to edit description or client info is a pain. here is another update ok the app. it says clients have paid invoice on my phone when they haven't app is frustrating to work with.
poor software and worse support. software has limited features and the support agent gave me 3 different answers to 1 question. what hope does anyone else have with support like that. avoid this product
. a great app that accomplishes pretty much what one may expect. some minor limitations compared to the full online's layout, but still very handy and easy to use.
cannot sign in with new update. i can’t sign in. keeps telling me my information is wrong even after resetting the password.
update the update, please.. i love this app. i use it every day, but the new update (4.5, released yesterday) will not let me record payments or save new invoices. it forces me to cancel each time, which doesn't save any changes made. please fix asap.
cant login. every time i try to create an account it says this id already exists. no matter which one of my email addresses i use it gives me the same message. then when i reset the password on my main email address the try to log in, it says no account with that id exist. help!!!
. worst app ever. at best there is a 30 second lag when opening the app, at worst it freezes my phone up and i have to restart the whole phone. the app doesn't display most of my customer transactions. awful, ill be finding a new cloud based accounting service.
go payment and expenses. needs expense entry and to integrate with go payment to get 5 stars. 61014  5 stars. thank you. great features. great app.
. easy and simple to use!would recomend it!
"useless. i use quickbooks online extensively at my corporate office. this app, and what is available through the ""mobile"" website version of qb online, is useless for getting any work done outside of the office."
excellent. quickbooks online works great for me and makes my work much easier especially with the phone app
easy to use and great features. i moved to quickbooks after trying xero, and find it at least as good for my needs and much better value. good foreign currency support, which is important for me.
. vat does not work
. user friendly for the droid not so much in the appleipad.
easy and convenient. i own a construction business, and have grown very fond of this app. it's really convenient to use the app to maintain our books on the go. my husband and i wear many hats in our business. our time is precious, but quickbooks online helps free up some of that time with its ease of use.
works a treat..... nice additional to the main on line version... all good on s6 edge, no problems.
great app!. love it! i like being able to use quickbooks from any device. easy to use.
touch id doesn't work; features spread across too many apps. intuit still spreads all the quickbooks features across various versions of apps (online, self employed, desktop, etc) that all require separate subscriptions and there's not one single app that can do it all. touch id on this app is broken so it only offers fingerprint access within a few minutes after the first unlock. then, it's back to password. i really wish there were better alternatives.
. doesn't seem to let me login with my google account as i do on the website. not sure how i should login in this case.
easy. this easy to use app is great for small businesses
". just signed up. you get a 24hr trial and then it asks you to spend $7.99mo with a 30% off discount (not sure if that is included, or what). so much for a ""free"" app."
worst.. i can't see my data in qb app. it isn't working. i have android 5. i can see some data in webpage version using chrome browser.
. best app
love this app!. very easy and simple to use. i can instantly add details from job to job and also great for keeping track of what's going on in my company. thanks jdm auto detailing
great app. the only thing i would change is making the app run things like the “report” section so that i could view profit and loss in categories such as “classes” or ‘’cashaccural” and add the ability to view and record sales tax payments. other than that this app is amazing and i don’t know how i would run my business without it.
. i love the ability to issue invoices and check the current payment status. bring able to photo receipts and record expenses as and when they happen is a great touch too.
great service. login problems.. live this service. just got a new phone (note 4). cannot login. i get emailpassword error. i've reset my password several times and can login online just fine.
. good mobile app app has a problem switching from screen to menu. tends to freeze up and close itself
. 1 star : i have been inundated with advertisements are so much i went ahead and download it it just so that i could give it a review. hopefully they will not continue to bug me with youtube videos and all these unimportant advertisements i didn't ask for in the first place.
. i don't usually write reviews, i always dread using the app. i have a lot of receipt that i need to add to expenses. it's a big effort to find the right transaction and add the receipt. it's painful to juggle between banking transaction and expenses. if usability of the app doesn't improve it's enough for me to pay extra and move to xero.
. i like the apps easy access but it truly suck because nothing is accessable properly. writing an estimate or invoice on this app is not possible. not properly anyway. its really not pleasant either going online via cellphone because it zooms in and out improperly. its very frustrating. as for quickbooks via laptop i love it. quickbooks has truly made my life much easier and way more organized. but the app needs to be fixed and also online via cellphone bugs.
. so easy and saves money on bookkeeping, very simple for non tech savvy
. extremely limited functionality. disappointing that intuit doesn't wake up to the extended needs of the new mobile app world. despite their efforts, feels like they can't shake the qb desktop mentality.
excellent!!. i find the app useful when i need it most. i enjoy the ability to add an expense at any time. sales receipts are handy. basically everything i really need without requiring a ton of space on my phone.
the planet. no better business software on the planet!
top shelf. excellent, simple, 5 stars
great app!!!!. i am a simple tradie and this app has made life so easy! not complicated easy fast and effective.
. good app
easy to use. this app is so quick and easy. my business is on the go all of the time and it makes estimates and invoicing so quick and easy.
. so far just trying out the app. it seems to have what i need so far but will do further work on it.
everything worked great until last update.. can't save invoices. have to login every time using password. payments don't apply to the invoices just to name a few. wish i hadn't updated.
this app will do the trick whenever you are on the go. i have been working with quickbooks online quite sometime and i like so far . the app is very convenient and simple which is great our busy schedule. thanks debora s
. no complaints so far! it's been very easy and there are plenty of videos online to explain things.
its quickbooks. and it sucks
. great app simplified my daily work.
useless. all i want is to do, while i am out and about, is enter my expenses and take a pic of the receipt and sync it. not even close to happening with this app.
all the essentials in an app. works good so far. allows for quick sorting of transactions and gives all of the essential components for a mobile version. it would be nice to be able to work in budgets in app.
virtually unusable. so much important elements that are not here  bills payment stub or remittance advise doesnt even have a reference or a check #, transaction history etc.
. for billing trying to learn
. great app!
qbo and this app two thumbs down.. how does such a large company make such a crappy product. basic logical steps can’t be completed. you go to summit a improvement and tons of people have listed the same things and nothing ever gets fixed. the app jumps back and forth between web view and app view. support is horrible. you can’t even move different parts of the invoice or estimate around in the app. switching to zoho
great app for my small business. went from excel and pdfs to qb..great decision! i'm very happy with it. one function i'd like to see added is integration with iphoneipadoutlook calendar.
terrible, embarrassing. after purchasing and downloading the app, it worked fine on day 1. tried to open it and show it off...it would not open. the next day, i gave it another chance. i successfully created an invoice template and then tried to edit a service. the app then froze. i will obtain a full refund and never give this another look.
update is awful.. please fix the app. it was great until the last update!! can't even get tech support without it crashing.
great start. app is perfect for a small business. the sooner you get organized using the app the less work you have to do down the road. love it
was enjoying it until ios13 update. this app was working fine until i updated to ios13...... boom! nothing now. crashes on opening everytime.
. be advised that you will have to pay for this app after you enter all your info!
constant errors. errors have gone away working flawlessly!
pay attention to billing ~ unethical business practices. intuit upgrades subscription and charges more than advertised price when you are not looking. horrible customer service  unable to reach by phone to resolve their seemingly intentional billing errors. they practice unethical business behavior, but switching costs are very high once accounts are set up.
. currently a subscriber to many quickbooks services. unfortunately, i am no longer able to access my account via the app on my mobile device after the latest update. will update my rating if the issue can be remedied
dissapointed. this is the frontline of my business as i am a mobil service technician. app no longer will save or complete an invoice. this is crippling my business! fixxxxxx please immediately!
. love being able to work in quickbooks from my phone! one of the best features is being able to take a picture of your receipt and attach it to your expenses right from your phone. makes your bookkeeping incredibly easy! wonderful customer service, love the payroll, too many good things to say about this app.!
not intuitive, not flexible, once in your stuck. terrible decision for a simple accounting software. converted from computer version...very unhappy.
. does want to launch properly on huawei p30. android version 9 please assist.
broken. the last update broke the app. various error messages. can’t safe expenses anymore. errors include asking to chose a template before saving expenses etc. bad woek
. love my quickbooks app!
really helpful. i now send me my invoice as soon as i finish my job and get paid immediately.
. great app
great app. hoping for updates. it won't do everything the online computer version will but i use it everyday to help keep track of everything. worth the download.
. super easy to use. simple and efficient. perfect small a smallside business.
. the update sucks
pretty good. this app is great. the quickbooks online system is fantastic. essential to running my business.
. lots of functionality and convenience in this robust small biz acctg software
take time to learn it. be patient
love it. business owner love this app
. i have been a quick book user for many years. great business tool. i use it for my construction estimates and invoicing.
excellent app. i like the qb app better than the online version of qb. the app is easier to use and allows me to operate my business with no paperwork and less time spent doing bookkeeping and office work.
room for improvement. it is a great app. it has a lot of room for improvement. i need to be able to assign each expense to individual jobs so i can job cost. also i need to be able to create multiple jobs per customer, ie sub jobs.
good program. qb online is very accessible
. the app needs to specify that it is for the online version only. in starting that it works with all intuit products, i expect just that, all versions of quickbooks.
. i really like being able to do all my estimate and invoices on my mobile phone
questionable developers and qa. don’t bother with this app. more time updating this weekly with version changes and bug fixes... jokers
"super userfriendly. i love this app, as it is very easy to use even if you aren't completely accounting savvy. i would like to be able to setup ""reminder"" emails to clients who have past due invoices. other than that, i'm very happy with the features of this app."
waste of time. crashes at least 50% of the time i try to enter an expense while on the go
it's scam don't download 19.99 per month they took from my account. i just did download almost 8 month ago this app they took from my account almost 19.99 per month after cancel also they are robbing very bad don't download at all even no customer service to help you to talk also bad bad super bad
awful app, won't open. app was working fine until a few days ago. reinstalling doesn't fix it. app opens and a second later disappears. not good for people trying to do their accounts.
bo. very happy with qbo
. i love this app. i absolutely love it.
extremely limited. no credit memos, you can't have a simple addition of how much you have to receive in open invoices at a specific date, no journal entries. i have only my ipad pro and if i try to access the web version, it's not compatible with any browser on ios. so you're stuck and you need a pcmac only for these things. it's a terrible, terrible experience.
great app but.... i love the app; works great for invoices and customer information on the go... however it would be nice if i could get more detailed reports and accounting information on it too... that's my only real complaint but you can still use a computer for that  miss those reports when i'm away from it though.
. it would be good to be able to save pdf receipts downloaded to my mobile straight onto the app. all i can do just now is take a screenshot.
. you did an update on friday afternoon while i need to use the program. now i can't access the program because i need to do an update that o cant do because of a glitch in the update
. updated app and its crashed. keeps telling me an update is available, click ok and google play just says open ?? i've literally just bought a subscription and already in the bit of free time i have, i cant even set the app up ??
excellent. best app to run your business
useless software. quickbooks is slow, has errors and the support is probably the worst i have ever had to use. we had an issue where we could not roster our staff for over a week due to a quickbooks error and every interaction with their support team has been horrible. the api to payroll is slow and buggy and they keep upping the prices. use another service!
awesome app. i was hesitant going to the monthly subscription, but it has been awesome always having access to my business account. the app looks and works just like the desktop app on my mac.
horrible mobile support!. this app has a ton of problems and nobody at intuit cares to fix it. app won't load half the time, invoices do not show up, errors all the time, signature capture doesn't work, and no support available for the mobile app. the only thing they know is to tell you to uninstall and reinstall it which fixes nothing! if they don't get their issues fixed, i am switching!
app glitches. i get an error message 6000 every time i try to add a customer, payment, or any new information. basically it's not functioning, i have to use the desktop version.
excellent. very sleek design yet powerful features. saves me so much time and bank feeds prevent mistakes. very happy!
great app for business.. a ++ must have app
mr smith. electrical contractor. early days yet but feels great especially linking bank to invoices and been able to see exactly what is going on in my business. so far a big thumbs up .
unusable in ios 13. after login, app crashes every time. i tried deleting and reinstalling as well. ios 13.0. please fix asap.
. the app is unusable and highly inferior to the web interface. when you create an invoice, it always defaults to retail invoice without the facility to change to tax invoice, so i'm forced to use the web interface for invoicing. suppliers activity always shows a blank page so again need web interface to view suppliers balance, expenses etc. can't you people make a decent app ?
nice but buggy. first i'd like to thank you for a great app that makes my business easy on the go! needs some attention but on my s5 it doesn't appear in the multitask list and my friends iphone has the ability to match bank feeds also which is missing on my android?
. not being free hurts. if this app was free and did not require a subscription to use for us that buy qb pro i would give this app a 45 star rating. this app is not perfect but what really hurts it is the price being 10 dollars a month to use this app.
. works great! i own a mobile cpr business and i'm able to create accurate invoices on the fly.
easy of use. i think the app will be great once i figure out how it works.
keep on improving!. hope that when using finger print to log in the crashes will subside. in addition looking forward to the mobil versions looking and acting more like the desktop. don't get me wrong... i do feel that there has been substantial progress but i'm looking forward to not having to drag my lap top.
overpriced and does not have all the features i use and need. look elsewhere for accounting software.
it’s great. although this program works incredibly well and i’m happy to of used it for the past two years… i would love to do an annual subscription, pay my payment once a year and carryon.
. it would be very nice if i could attach my pdf warranty to every job without having to upload it from my device every time and choose it from a list like notes. but notes is so stupid you can only attach a jpg to it, no documents!!
high caliber. awesome! makes billing and keeping track of your money infinitely easier.
exactly what i need. amazing app and way simple to use!
fantastic app for my ipad pro!. i recently acquired an ipad pro to use for my business and instantly downloaded quickbooks to use on the go. this app has been wonderful for sending invoices, logging my expenses, and managing the books in general. so far, i have yet to experience a crash and everything has been working well for my needs!
great for start up. the app works great! i can do nearly all of my bookkeeping from my phone. if i need more detailed i just use my laptop! the monthly subscription is nice too!
crashing all the time. i know it's version 1.0, but still. it's crashing left, right and center all the time. you may want to wait 68 months before this app is stable.
fantastic!!!. brilliant app. never even noticed the expenses bit so will have to fill this out for the year. absolutely brilliant. first class
really good software. i just wish the software team will work on all the glitches and fix the way done windows freeze... also they need to add to quickbooks online and make it more flexible accounting wise just like the desktop version
great app!. only complaint is i wish i could create a invoice and with the total job and then invoice for a smaller amount keeping the job total on the same invoice if that makes sense. no other complaints. overall i would recommend to anyone!
ok but. reasonably happy with it but so many of my customers are also suppliers so i really would like an entity database where an entity could be both a customer and a supplier rather than having separate customer and supplier databases which necessitates the creation and therefore data entry for the same entity twice.
so far so good. i've been using the app for a week and love it so far. i find it extremely easy to make invoices in the field, and also very convenient to accept payments.
happy customer. i love this app.can do my invoices everywhere on my mobile or tablet.
. as an accountant it is a handy app to have installed on your phone.
. sales receipt and invoice not round off available in mobile apps create invoice not show retail invoice and tax invoice in mobile
great app. it good for all your on the go payments and keeps it in order.
high hopes cause big fails. the app crashes all of the time. no integration with desktop versions but ok. i though i would have something on the go for small invoices. i can't get through the first invoice. all progress gets lost with the crashes. i love how much time i save with the desktop version. there customer service has always been terrible. they can't even have a fully working version for the trial period. fail!
highly recommend. i highly recommend this app. i run my business with quickbooks online and use this app daily. i use it to create estimates and invoices mostly but also look up look up costumers balances and run reports.
useless. this app is useless. you can't even see your check register. pathetic.
. never used an app before for my bookkeeping but feel confident this is the way to go. this app is good though plenty of room for improvement. i am now using it and have used it to now feb 2018. so far so good higly recommend it for all business people on the go
. awesome to keep my books neat, love how i can send and estimate via my mobile.
pas mal !. application très conviviale — me sauve plusieurs heures de pénible saisie comptable par mois. quelques petites fonctions additionnelles permettraient une utilisation encore plus conviviale, comme le fait de pouvoir par défaut définir des taxes (qui sont, dans 95% des cas toujours la même chose) au lieu de devoir spécifier le tout chaque fois...
small business. this make life easier for my small business. i wish i found out about it sooner. we use it on a daily basis and love how easy it is to use
. the loading response is rather slow.
. not being free hurts. if this app was free and did not require a subscription to use for us that buy qb pro i would give this app a 45 star rating. this app is not perfect but what really hurts it is the price being 10 dollars a month to use this app.
new update keeps crashing. well ever hour or two it crashes while i am in the middle of looking things up or when i am making an estimate for a customer. and this is with the pastiest update. oh and it keeps telling me there is a new update, but i already have it. fix it, my renewal is coming up and you aren’t the only game in town
don’t update!. so many bugs. a bunch of features have changed for the worse! running on ipad pro 11” ios 13.1.2
sales tax calculation is wrong. when creating an invoice, the app does not honor customer's sales tax setting. it applies tax even on customers with tax turned off. please fix asap!!!!
. makes life so much easier, i would recommend this to any entrepreneur.
not easy to use. simple tasks like entering a transaction are complex. app and online qb have a slow response when tapping things. just overall frustrating trying to switch from desktop qb to the app and online qb.
keeps crashing. every time i try to upload a receipt from my phone, it crashes when i press save & doesn’t save at all. i’ve tried closing the app & trying again, but it does it every time, so basically i can’t take a picture of any receipt & upload it. please fix! update: i still can’t upload a receipt unless i take a picture of it elsewhere & upload vs taking a picture of it on the app.
great bit of kit. value for money!! 👍😬. we use qb on the desktop, ipad and phone. highly recommend it !!
love itrepeat user. i love quickbooks because of the ease of getting things done in accounting. i am by no means an accountant but this does everything for me and i just hand it to my accountant at the end of the year which makes it so easy.
great app.. intuit and odyssey have been very helpful with the company integration into quickbooks online from qb 2013.
. it a great accounting program. i just wish you could do more from the app with out having to go online
excellent. my first time using accounting software this is the easiest i've tried love it
quick books for my phone. this app has made made me look more professional and helped me be a mobile office from one app. i love it!!
great app. great app. gives me complete flexibility while operating my small business!
. this is an excellent program for invoicing and tracking payment. it does a poor job of matching a bank account with your qb account, so i do not use it for book keeping.
cost. does this app cost anything, i am a small business, i haven’t made a profit yet, and don’t have much money, any help?
. stop. signing. me. out. of. this. damn. app. especially when i go to the length of setting up an additional pattern password specifically for this application. there is no good reason to sign me out, and it constantly does so forcing me to look up my password.
great app!. very userfriendly and convenient. great for people who are needing to create invoices and estimates and track expenses. the iphone app is fantastic!
need ipad update. the ipad app should be as capable as the desktop version. when are we going to see this? iphone app is pretty stout but the ipad app needs update and soon.
where is the expense part of the app?. i want to take a photo of receipts in android app and upload! where is it? my husband can do it from his iphone, but my samsung s4 doesn't have an expense button with the camera etc..,
using for almost 30 yrs and about to quit. very sad that they charge for every issue now, to pay a bill, to use an invoice, even to do a credit for a vendor. it's going to be less expensive to hire a book keeper!
supper great and easy. this is a time saver app
. would love to be able to access payroll on the app
crashes. keeps crashing. can't use app at all.
. how much does it cost per month or per year? i have quickbooks software on my pc does it link with the software on my personal computer?
. great extention to the web portal
. this website is terrible and the customer service is friendly yet not helpful!!! i want to cancel my subscription and yet told to remove the app from my tablet....wrong by removing the app it does not cancel my subscription...very unhappy!!
struggle. guys i've been struggling to log in onto this app from my galaxy s6 for several weeks now, i'm considering switching to another provider. please fix this bug. ive tried for hours at a time, everytime it asks me if i am a robot, but it never logs in just hours of saying signign in. the whole point of having this app is being able to do stuff on the go and right now thats not working...
very good!. really does help to keep everything at your finger tips, it's a convenient way to keep track of your earnings and invoices. one quick glance and you know where your company is at! 👍🏻
. works great, i love this app.
. good app. always improving.
crashes on ios 13. worked well on ios 12.1. now crashes as soon as logged in to quickbooks account.
. am trying to login, wont let me, technical problems. i have all my expenses in there...
very good. very good and easy app.
one man show. this app helps tons: estimate and invoice from anywhere.
best app ever. i am a tech on the go , and we made the switch from paper invoicing to quick books online. i cannot tell you how much this app saves me on time and frustration , everything is there at the tip of your finger. thanks intuit for making my work that much easier!
brilliant. excellent accounting software for new small business. only issue i have is that i bought a subscription online and the app keeps telling me to subscribe
". its ok. expect more for a paid app though. im sure there will be updates  that will be available at a ""small extra cost""...."
luv it!. have been using quickbooks for many many years. have loved it from the beginning. i am now enjoying the online version even more. has been a wonderful addition for me and all of my clients. has made travel so much easier for my clients to still be able to keep tabs on their businesses. strongly recommend!
. so far it does exactly what i need. just starting out so i'm sure there's plenty to learn yet
quickly. quickbooks online is ready to use. i write invoices and email the customer a copy immediately. thanks quickbooks for being so easy to use.
. almost 2 weeks now the app has not been working. the dashboard is just totally blank. im having to take a toptop to work and tether off my phone.
. awful software!! support is ridiculous. 6 month of transactions went missing. now have to buy software for $80 to convert pdf to qbo files and upload manualy. what a mess. try something else, not trust worthy.
. love this app, keeps track of all my expenses and payments from clients. easiest way to do estimates and invoices as well.
great on the go. i absolutely love using this app, lets take my office on the road!
nocturnalvicky394@gmail. awesome app, thanks
great app always adding new features. great app always adding new features.!
. doesn't work in india
pretty lame. seriously? the thing crashes a lot , but i can deal with that. the real problem for me is the lack of calendar in the invoice line item. i would love to use this, but if i can't put the date that i provided a service in my invoice, the it is useless to me. too bad safari doesn't work either, or i would just use that.
awesome!. i have always enjoyed using quickbooks. over the years i have moved from quickbooks to quickbookspro to quickbooks enterprise and now quickbooks online. this online system is awesome. if integrates well with other systems i use, it’s easy to navigate (once you take the free courses), customer service is excellent when i have issues  and it will move straight into my turbotax corporate filings. love, love, love it!
best accounting app. perfect for any small business. never had any problem, never crashes. only need more invoicing templates.
great way to get my money in and estimates out.. really happy quickbooks enables me to work anywhere creating on the spot estimates and invoices making my cash flow work better for me. great app
. like this app! haven't gotten too deep into the functionality
good app. good app more functionaly could be added
best mobile accounting app. great improvements in the latest version. easily the best ipadiphone app for accounting, that sits well alongside the full featured qbo software.
. does what i need but could add a few things i love this app. i use it in my barbershop and i like the fact everything is all there whether it is on my tablet, phone or computer. the only other thing i would like to see incorporated into it is the ability to generate paystubs and do payroll then email to employees. but we can't have everything we want. aside from that, fantastic program. keep up the good work.
. leaks your info to several malicious ip addresses. including facebook. sad but true. (no root firewall app)
. i got the app working. it would be better if you could attach receipts to your expenses within the app. like the self employed app does.
great. great software.
recommend for one stop booking & accounting. i tried many softwares for accounting , the only reason i choose this platform because of its graphics & designs , the dashboard itself give you a ray of positivity , they design the dashboard and entire platform graphics in future aspect. apart from it there customer service is also and helpful. cheers !! ashutosh
. this app is very useful for preparing and sending quotes and invoices on the go. so if i'm out of the office for the day, i can get work done.
the application for the tablet. the application for my ipad tablet does not let me see checks i have written that have not cleared. (it does show my account balance) i like the online version but i for the life of me don’t know why the internet based application does not work on my ipad plus and their application for ipads is simply said  horrible.
. do not buy quickbooks through this app. you will be charged but unable to use it and have to subscribe again through the real quickbooks. google play charged me and took the money but i have no access to do anything in my account and will have to pay again to quickbooks.
ads and limited features. it’s a hassle to figure out how to say no to the ads without accidentally buying something. that applies to ipad and web version. the ipad has limited features compared to the web version. if you pay for qb online, you will forever be a small business, working for intuit.
quickbooks. has worked very well for me, i'm new to accountinginvoicing software and cannot make comparisons. however this software saves me a great deal of time at quarter end
j'adore!!!. tout simplement super! l'application est facile à utiliser. très pratique de pouvoir faire des factures directement chez nos clients et pouvoir leur envoyer par courriel en direct!
app crashes. this app crashes or cannot save my data on every entry i make. horrible app!!
. makes my small business accounting much easier for me. i can send invoices, quotes and pay bills all from the comfort of my cell when i am on the road between jobs.
. stan f. would be great if it has signature capture so that a customer can sign the invoice or receipt. the ipad version has the signature capture feature but quickbooks wants 12.99 per month just to be able to use the ipad app and other 27.00 per month for the online essentials account. thats 480.00 per year just to be able to get a signature capture feature that is only available for the ipad version. quickbooks too primitive
awesome product for small business!!. unbelievably convenient! from my imac, to my tablet, to my phone i can access, enter payment, send an estimate, or invoice, etc and it’s all connected because i have online quickbooks. hint: go they intuit directly! itunes was charging me an extra $5 a month. $19.99 a month they intuit and worth every penny!! biggest time saver + unsurpassed professionalism to my customers and speed of connectivity!!
". error message that cannot be fix ""cannot add this invoice, if error continues, please contact support"" that cannot be fix from quickbooks my android app been like this close to 1 month cannot create invoices estimates so on my business suffer cause of that, have use regular computer to create what was said. not good for business all subscriptions are active."
update the update, please.. i love this app. i use it every day, but the new update (4.5, released yesterday) will not let me record payments or save new invoices. it forces me to cancel each time, which doesn't save any changes made. please fix asap.
app crashes in ios9. this app was working great before the recent update. app just crashes when i try to open. i use an ipad 3rd gen running the latest version of ios9. please fix!!
. this app is just perfect. simple and easy to use and anyone without any accounting background can easily adapt to use it. 👍
subscription portal broken. infuriating support staff that don't have a clue. actually tried to make me pay a second subscription to access my data.
this app is harmful. support is useless or you really can’t recover the emails you sending to the clients with your invoice
solid app. it's a very good mobile app
doesn’t let you do self assessment tax. this app only does my business tax return, and whilst it doesn’t explicitly promise more, because it doesn’t let me do my self assessment (buy to let) it means i still need another app to do this. and an account on top. being such a major tax app, the fact it can’t deal with all my tax matters is a major fail.
ios 13. app crashes before opening! please fix asap!
sales tax calculation is wrong. when creating an invoice, the app does not honor customer's sales tax setting. it applies tax even on customers with tax turned off. please fix asap!!!!
amazing app!!!!. love quickbooks and also the app. excellent layout design. just one thing is needed. please allow the app to support touchid for the login process. this would be just the best update ever! thanks
lacking compared to ios version. the layout and functionality compared to the ipad version is horrible and hard to use. plus there is no way for the customer to sign for invoice or estimate on tablet or phone. i am an android fan all the way, but i am going to have to purchase an ipad to get the functionality i need. i am very disappointed.
waiting for updates. quite frankly, it's been totally useless. the app does not sync new data entries with the online database. i've already spent well over three hours with multiple customer support reps. the idea of creating invoices is great....only problem....it does not work!!!
never disappointed. best accounting software available!
great for mobile. i have enjoyed using the app. has what i need for most part.
. very easy to use. i love that i can create and email invoices to my customers!
qb. completely unusable since 6th september update. crashes all the time on latest ios please fix this.
good, not great. you can do the basics, like sync bank accounts, run a few basic reports. but you can’t take many useful actions or get reliable search results. the bank accounts render weirdly. it’s more like a novelty rather than a tool.
excellent app. make life way easy for small business
"communicates across platforms. i enjoy being able to enter an expense on my phone app and see it on my laptop. i have had to discontinue the ""mac app"" on my new macbook because it shuts down or tries to log in without letting me enter the password and ends up in an endless loop. i just use the web version and that seems to be ok. i wish the easy to use features on my phone were as easy on the laptop."
great app. i love this app
love the mobile app. they have made huge improvements to the mobile app. i don't have to access my desktop version as much. has greatly improved my ability to send invoices to customers in the fly. has decreased waiting for payments of invoices dramatically.
great app. deffinetly brings organazion to our bookkeeping. love the update.
i prefer it to the 'software' version. i like the mobile access.
poor compatibility. online version does not work with safari. quickbooks refused a refund stating it is not there issue. avoid and just get a good account
. love the app! everything i need, when i need it!
function doesn't follow form.. 5 stars for functionality, subtract 4 stars because it's been 5 months and quickbooks still isn't optimized for iphone 6 or iphone 6 plus. the wasted space and bloated images are annoying; and the lack of willingness to adopt to new display resolutions makes me not want to invest in intuit products and services.
. when is the app going to be available for india??
if i didn't have to use it, i wouldn't. constant interruptions for surveys, having to log back in. nearly impossible just to use it...
. i am using quick books since a weak very happy with it as of now the help line is also quite good they will help me to solve my query or doubts then and there problems faced so far is there is no sms options and sometimes waiting time for my turn in the helpline
mobile app works, but can be better. edit.. android works better now. i can see more info, but keep adding more features till it gets closer to the standalone program
"super userfriendly. i love this app, as it is very easy to use even if you aren't completely accounting savvy. i would like to be able to setup ""reminder"" emails to clients who have past due invoices. other than that, i'm very happy with the features of this app."
. says its free, requires subscription.
. the app is a wonderful accompaniment to the software which makes tracking expenses and invoices really easy
user role permission not supported. custom user role not supported on ipad. quickbooks recommends you to use online but the invoice interface is “blowout from screen” in chrome and safari and no available signature from customer. its annoying to use it online. this happens, at least, when the user have custom role, just permission for sales for instance.
does very little. waste of time, minimal functions
. wow this is a fantastic program i am a new small business owner. i have learned aso much just by using this app!
broken for ios 13 please update. when you jack up the price 25% i expect more
major flaw. the app ui is pretty good and i really like the interface. the problem is that a lot of my invoices are not even viewable on the app. basically anything that has a delayed charge on it won't show up so there is a major glitch there or something.
junk. this app is an embarrassment to use. doesn't attach correct to emails, rude default email tags, and prints too light to fax. i used qb contractor for 10 years before being talked into ipad by apple as the way to go mobile. save your money do things right. this freezes up a lot too which if you have time to wait may be for you.
sweet baby jesus this is exactly what i need. it has never been so easy to stay so financially organized. as someone who os chronically disorganized this app is a blessing. definitely worth the price when you need to record your expenses and write receipts, invoices and all sorts of other business related things to be professional.
excellent on the go apps  for small business. easy to navigate .
so useful.... i don't really use it like it's designed. i have 50 company trucks & 5 semi trucks to keep track of at our repair shop. this allows me to document everything. each vehicle as a customer with year & type always easy to find. each invoice acts as a repair, allows me to document every detail and track costs. luv this app! well worth the subscription fee.
. good app need a few obvious corrections but will be well worth the money when there are fixed
great mobile app. this app is perfect for my business. i'm out of the office majority of the day so being able to send or create estimates and invoices is very nice. quick and easy
app is ok but expected better. i recently switched to quickbooks online as my firm is growing. the app is nice and works well. however this an accounting bug that doesn't take into account cogs for non inventory items that have a cost assigned to them when setting up the productservice. this increases our work as we have to manually enter the cost of each item sold....this is ridiculous
not pleased. i put the qb online app on my new ipad thinking i wouldn't have to lug my laptop around the country anymore.... it does not have the functionality or settings i need. i cannot input bills from other contractors on the mobile app! they have a loooong way to go... it’s still clunky and like the cd desktop versions severely mentally disabled cousin. lame........
amazing. but how do i change the currency? i need to use kenya shillings. i also can't see a trial balance
fantastic app. really easy to use. saves me a lot of time as i can do my invoicing on the go. make sure you sign up for quickbooks online, not self employed, and then your accountant can use quickbooks accountant to access your files.
ok when it works.. this app is ok when it works but if intuit is having issues, they will never admit it and they will leave you hanging for up to a day or more without help! not worth the money.
easy and convenient. it actually made recordkeeping fun! and i can stay current instantly from my truck.
the best accounting app i've used. quickbooks intergrates seamlessly with your store all you have to do is keep track of your expensenses!
from xero to quickbooks. i went from sage line 50 (blinkin' expensive but brilliant if your an accountant) to xero (very good for basic invoices but no estimate facilities on the app, no good for my job) to quickbooks online. easy to use. does what i need. reliable and relatively quick.
. poor customer service. had to change bank account to keep them from billing me
no ability. i download the app and signed up, then i realized that i have to be self employed
very disappointed. there is very little you can actually do with the app.. not impressed am canceling the account.
signin process needs work. i allow fingerprint signin, but that option doesn't show up when i need to signin. i enabled twostep verification and set up google authenticator, but when i signin the only option is text message. the whole process just feels very sloppy and halfassed.
research before you buy. program works ok but has a high learning curve. also apps have restrictions on what you can do. cannot post new checks in apps. cannot log onto the website from a mobile device. reports are limited. i do not do invoicing and use it mostly for my accountant, and i'm still learning so the final jury is still out but from what i've seen so far i can't give it a higher rating.
not working with ios13.0. not able to click on customers, create new estimates or invoices. tried reinstalling. still no luck.
doesn't work. app doesn't sync all data with quickbooks online. i see only my company name and customer list. no invoices, expenses etc. intuit support we're not able to help.
. great app! very affordable. quick to uload and edit inventory items.
not functioning. does not function as expected. vendors do not show any activity...
. i'm locked out! unable to sign in we've noticed some suspicious behavior on your account. to keep information safe we have temporarily locked out your account from further access i spend hours on the phone with all kind of support guy no one was able to just unlock!this is going on more then a month and all those stupid customer support are just googling the issue. and not finding a solution just fix this! we are not playing guessing game here
quickbooks online rocks!. setting up qbonline to invoice, purchase, and banking downloads makes it possible to be completely mobile with your business! to reconcile accounts you'll need to access the full power of qbonline on a browser, preferably on your tablet, laptop or desktop.
great app. can see my transactions in real time.
. useless app. can't integrate one of the biggest bank of australia (cba) with this app. support is just forwarding issue from one team to other. wasted almost one hour on the phone. solution is to forward the issue to next level. there are three companies under my account with same name. cannot delete company. how app allow to create three identical names?? wast of time and money.
good app for business owners. i think the app does a good job with tracking expenses and billing. as a whole i think there may be better programs out there. do you research before signing up.
quick booksuseful app..!. it is amazing and very useful to me...and can you please tell what are the services we can access?
. i've been trying to use this app for months and months. it doesnt work, and nobody has done anything about the problems even though there are numerous complaints and bad reviews. i'm getting ready to stop paying for quickbooks and find something else. i mainly wanted to us the app for taking pictures of receipts, but due to the syncing issues, i can't submit more than one receipt picture without the app hanging or freezing. i've tried reinstalling, clearing cache, etc. with no luck.
better than before. i like the ability to record expenses on the fly and take a picture of the receipt. would be better if the smart logic time saving features in quickbooks online were incorporated.
we love the qb app. one of the most useful things we have “out in the field” is our qb app that allows us to do bookkeeping by extension. probably the craziest place yet was checking qb from the pyramids of giza in egypt. it’s extremely convenient.
. please add 2 factor authorisation to the app instead of having to receive a text or email all the time when i log into the website.
. great app!
good. wish i could do payroll on the app too
. really easy app to use only missing expense scanner with auto fill like the sole trader app if it had this it would be a 5 star app
. super simple and i love the fact that's it is simple and keeps me on the move
needs work ipad version. limited reports, restrictions on creating categories. simple things like always upper case in the state box, locks up when doing a quote  have to save often on ipad.
on way my home. thanks
is an average app. is a good app but with all these update is confusing my customers and sometimes they can't pay online. i can't access it from my phone sometime. it's in and off so be warned and be patient. this is an important tool for my business.
does what i need. doesn't do s lot, but does exactly what i need in the field.
poor functionality. constant crashes inability to complete selected tasks poor functionality this app try’s hard but doesn’t quiet make it with its functions. it didn’t at all shot me but that’s what the 3 day free trial is for. i wasn’t going to rate this app but after they charged me $10.50 for a 1 month subscription after i cancelled and deleted the app; i will rate it
. quickbooks banking is my favorite part of the app, because it's easy you catergorise all your expenses and incomes. the dashboard shows an overview of your financial situation.
more of a headache than a help. registered online, used same login info for the app, and the app says it's a free trial. online service not communicating well with app and i was hoping to use the app most of the time. sigh.
. nice and easy app
be careful. i resynced my bank feeds and two years of transactions got deleted. i spent an hour on the phone and was told they couldn't fix it...
quite easy to use. great for my phone, just wished when i used it on my ipad or my laptop but it automatically populated or searched for current clients in my contacts.
. for an app qbo is awesome. it does not have all the features of a desktop program but what app does? you guys are doing an incredible job and making impovements to both program and app all the time.
excellent program. i am so impressed with this new app, it is very easy to use and very helpful for my construction business. i don't even have to go to the office to make an invoice i can do it right in my truck on my phone and send it. i can check on expenses... it's a breeze and worth the time to get to know this app and online program.
don’t rate before use. fantastic app. easy life. worth giving it a try.
. please add the option to take a picture to the receive and add it automatically to the transaction
. does not work in india
. love it!! you cannot operate all the functions of normal qb online but sending invoices and recieving payment are very easy. i never forget to send an invoice anymore. the minute the service is complete, my guys send me a message and i send the invoice right from my smart phone. highly recommended for any business that provides mobile services.
great app. works very well with the ipad. allows you to make invoices and notes on the go. much better being cloud based than pc based. it costs more but it definitely worth it when it comes to the convenience.
tax problem in hong kong. i mostly use it to do my expenses, now with this update, they force me to input tax. but there is not tax here in hong kong. didn’t have the problem before. i don’t know how long they need to fix that. 👎🏻👎🏻
best app yet. i manage my invoices and customers everywhere this is great. okay for the monthly cost.
small bussines tool. perfect! for on people with small businesses that are on the go. this app makes my life easier! i totally wish it was cheaper!
great app!¡. im always on the go and this app is great when invoiceestimate has to be sent immediately or when there is no computer access¡¡ highly recommended for biz on the go!!
. always a great experience!
very limited functionality. the app has very limited functionality  i can’t even see the purchase ledger on the app never mind post invoices or take photos of them. lists supplier contact information only, not even account balances. useless. i have to log on to full site and try to navigate around it on phone screen which is difficult. oh and by the way, very unhelpful customer service too!
number monkey. i love pitching the receipt after i enter my expenses!
update is buggy. the latest update won't save invoices correctly and doesn't pull up all my clients names. i hope it's fixed soon i use it daily. also won't allow touch id or pin sign in!
. great app... easy to use
it was barely ok to start with!. i had used quickbooks for several years and then went to the online version. i liked the features it had, but really didn’t like the 600.00 a year fee. for the most part it worked, but never all of the time. then when they raised the subscription price to 720.00 a year, that was it. i said good bye and found another program. no regrets!
. please update. can't login
no access to payroll. the app seems to have a menu for everything except payroll. i find these types of oversights all over quickbooks online glaringly obvious features that are incomprehensibly missing and customer service has no answers. don't waste your time.
. great app. getting better all the time too
. great accounting capabilities for small and medium enterprises, compatible across all my devices. taxation is resolved quickly, no stress and most definitely no complains
rave. i have enjoyed having customer information at my fingertips on this app.
. this app literally will never open.
. signed on to the mobile app but it will not pull up the data for my business. keeps saying that there is a technical issue. have tried many times. no luck.
. easy to use. great app. just wish it was a little cheaper. thanks
"fees on fees. while the app itself works and is fairly handy, i strongly advise against quickbooks as a company. i signed on as a business owner for $6.95 a month and was immediately slapped with over $100 in fees hidden in ""fine print"". worse is the utter inability to get any customer support from intuit. i canceled my subscription and despite already paying for the month, lost access immediately and lost all of my records. then i got billed again. stay away."
fairly useless. this app is difficult to navigate. it doesn't come close to mimicking qbo for pcs. the functionality is very limited. it's ok for looking up some things but difficult to update info such as logging checks or deposits.
app constantly glitches and it's very slow. i've had so many issues with this app. lately it has been extremely slow, it randomly shuts down for no reason in the middle of inputting a transaction and it won't load larger invoices. i'm very disappointed as i use this on a daily basis for my business.
mr gottesman. just the best as best could be!!
. i am finally happy 99% with qb online quickbooks has finally added the ability to add expences through the android market. it is now, by far the easiest way to send out estimates, invoices and add expenses. i'm a contractor and it works perfect for what i do. well worth the $40.00 a month, trust me. ............
"problems. this app will not let me save an invoice, it always says ""this number already exists"" no matter which number i add. only started the error on the 301112, please fix."
nice app that works well!!. works well, well thought out and presented. helps me day to day for sure!!
good app and great support. easy to use although experienced problem with vat rate not being editable in online desktop version. intuit' response was really quick and efficient and friendly. highly recommend.
. absolutely wonderful, works well along with mileage tracker, would hate to be without it
. no matter what it wouldnt let me sign in, making me reset my password only to get a different log in error. after uninstalling reinstalling i'm still left with the same issues
was an excellent app but...... never had a problem up to a month ago. upgraded my phone to galaxy s7 and now app does not work. this glitch needs to be fixed asap. i rely on this as i'm out in the feild daily.
nightmare to dream app. might help save a lot of angst between my wife and i when it comes to invoicing, collecting, and tracking. looks very promising, invoiced thousands with it last night with relative ease on two macs, two samsung smartphones, and an asus laptop. updated fine across all devices. am curious about mileage tracking and auto populating from my google calendar.
favorite app. my favorite app. i use it on a daily biases to send invoices right after i complete a job. makes my life so much less stressful.
. unique app
. easy to use, easy to keep your invoices accurate, costumers like it
review this, quickbooks. i was using the app on my ipad, and kept getting a notice to ‘submit a review’. only choice was ‘ not now ‘ . after every transaction, after every page change, the message came up to ‘submit a review’ i pay a monthly subscription, stop bugging me. here’s your review.
ok but struggles on ipad pro. what the app does it does well but it doesn’t do payroll as well as some other features. logging in to the website on my ipad pro isn’t much better.
iphone x is not fully supported. thank you for stretching the app the full height of the iphone x. however, features are behind the home slab and is not taking advantage of the processing power because it feels slow. not optimized.
great for my business. ❤️ this program
great app!. it is awesome everything i need in one spot.
error. when i'm create account, step after company name creation, always getting server error. and i can't even try this app without broken registration. :(
do it if you can get it to work. i loved the mobil app but intuit doesn't support it any longer. they want you to do the $54.00month hosting instead. i called twice today to try to get this app working and they said it wasn't their app. if you can get this to sync with you qb software, go for it.
top notch. this app works great, easy to use after i played around with it for a bit. very convenient and quick to use.
does not work after update. tech support recommended i get a android. claims apple is the problem.
lacking. this app has potential, but it's lacking. especially the fact that you cannot make deposits on the mobile app, only on the desktop version.
no bill?. come on, we can do all things with expense and nothing with bills? bills are the big part of our business expenses from our vendors. they are not even added to the total expense on the summary dashboard, how can we really tell how our business is doing when a big chunk of cost not appearing? please include the ability to enterviewedit bills asap.
great app. i've started using quick books as i switched from kashflow it's much easier and has a great user interface.
cant edit payroll options. cant make a lot of changes pertinent to online users who need access thru their phone.
best app for invoicing. hands down the best invoicing app i have found, it was recommended by another business owner and i am very pleased with the purchase.
. good app, but please can you add mode of payment to sale receipts and receive payment. anytime i do sale receipt on the app, it post the cash directly to undeposited fund account i created instead of bank account of cash and cash equivalent that i created... please help us fix this pls
. great app
good app. needs improvements as its a little tricky to use. and doesn't allow much access. but overall okay
handy. great app! can create estimates and get signatures right on my phone!
almost great. this app would be better if it had a little more functionality. i would love to be able to upload photos to invoices or even send an invoice from the app. i find myself not really using the app very much because it does not have full functionality. it would be nice if qb could mirror their web based app.
great but…. this app won’t get more than two stars until i can enter a single time activity from my phone.
. so far very handy app for my small business needs
. it makes life easier!
app is ok but expected better. i recently switched to quickbooks online as my firm is growing. the app is nice and works well. however this an accounting bug that doesn't take into account cogs for non inventory items that have a cost assigned to them when setting up the productservice. this increases our work as we have to manually enter the cost of each item sold....this is ridiculous
avoid like the plague!. app doesn't work, says trial expired. customer support are unhelpful and have no idea when it will be fixed. we have a years worth of books on this and now we need to find new software  we've been in business for more than 26 years and have never known service like this. seriously, find another solution. this is not the software you are looking for.
needs a calendar interface. great app, a clickable calendar link would make it more user friendly. also needs the ability to edit notes on products and services.
not working on ios 9. hopefully you all are seeing the crash logs, but after i login to the app it crashes when downloading my company data.
. i downloaded this app and not once has it worked. it crashes when i'm trying to login. i've never made it past the login screen!
"wont work. app keeps telling me ""can't connect to server"""
. since a few updates ago when fingerprint sign in was introduced, i've had problems with mileage logging never logs it properly and data is never saved 😡
valuable tool to have in the field. i installed the app, imported company files from my desktop and boom i was doing estimates and invoices in the field.
needs timesheet support. price went up 100 a year and still no timesheet support outside of desktop app
not connecting. used to work. now after login it's not connecting.
limited features in the app. the app has extremely limited features as compared to web cant send customer statements or edit recurring transactions or match partially paid invoices.
garbage. quick books won’t upload garbage use and other accounting software.
great on the go!. not as detailed as i would like but does the job!
useless since update. the last update brings a gorgeous splash screen. i know this because i see it dozens of times each day since i have to log in every time i open the app! completely useless now.
great for on the go. i originally only used quick books software on my pc. it was still nice software but i would often find myself behind or forgetting to update my accounts. now with the software on my iphone i can easily update everything immediately. i have been using it for a while now and haven't experienced any problems.
disappointed. just updated to the latest version and this app is crashing all day i can’t even use it normally i need to log on 10 times to write one customer i can’t run my business normally like this please fix asap the app tells me you need to do critical updates. idiot i juts updated the app and now it crashes ever time i open it
. very easy to use. easy to understand. cheaper than hiring an accountant. love this very much.
. this app is incredible saves me a lot of time from going to my laptop.
. very powerful program.
invoice menu. filling in spaces for explaining what the invoices for not easy to apply.. design poorly.
awful. doesn't work.. logs me out instantly every time i sign in... wish i could evaluate more. love the online version, but this app is struggling.
. it's a great program, not the most user friendly app ever but still a great appprogram.... the fees are high as well but depends on your situation if it's worth it to you or not...
great update to already great app. the latest update is great! being able to reconcile through app is awesome. best accounting app out!!!
not a user friendly apps. not flexible
. not all the features are in the app. great on the go!
. rubbish app as never let's me update my bank transactions. i go to refresh and it simply comes up saying none and all up to date when it's not. makes the app unusable for me.
not enough!. this app does not have the functionality that qbo has. therefore, useless. if we can't use the ipads in the store, what use is the app? 1. can't enter an invoice with the details 2. can't enter a vendor bill and do splits. 3. can't put payments in undeposited funds. 4. yep, useless.
. very good program, other than the price has went up 3 times this year.........getting expensive.......started at $12 a month and now at $25
great app.. will help me tract expenses!!
excellent for the it service provider. as an it service provider, this app allows me to log my hours and mileage in the field. i can even email customer invoices immediately after services are performed. this is, of course, paired with quickbooks online plus, which allows you to log hours per customer. highly recommended!!
nice app! but needs improvement.. please add a delayed charges option. i need to be able to add charges in the field from my mobile device. the app works well on my gs5
. the app works good.....when it works. but it freezes often......and when theres a technical issue it takes 45 days for them to resolve the issue. wasnt what i expected at all from quickbooks.
easy business.. makes business income and expenses easy to track and manage payments.
game changer. highly recommend qbo for any business trying to keep up with the cloud.
. after installing and recovering my account details this app offers me some trial? should be stated somewhere beforehand.
wouldn't know what to do without it. love it helps keep me honest in line and stress free
excellent app. helpful reports and nice review of recent transactions to make sure operations are in tact.
can't match bank transactions reliably. the only reason i use this app is to match bank transactions when i have some 'down' minutes. lately, they keep getting kicked back to me, so i have to match them on my pc anyway. also, you don't have access to both memo and description, so your notes don't appear in reports if you add the transaction though a bank connection.
". often doesn't work. customer service tells me not to use the app, to access account from web browser. the numbers you get there may be undependable. don't trust it. the browser doesn't work with the phone. there only reason for quickbooks online is access while away from the computer. i often get the message,""check back in a few hours"". isn't that great when standing in front of a customer trying to write an invoice."
. awesome! they still need to improve a bit for the mobile app, as some things are not available on it compared to desktop, but really, i couldn't run my business without quickbooks online
. first of all i want to say that qb online is the best accounting software.unfortunatelly the app crashes on samsung s8 oreo.hope this will be fixt soon as is a shame,beeying such a great software.
efficient app. as a bookkeeper i use qbo for all of my clients as well as for my personal account. it just keeps getting better and better. accepting transactions is a breeze as is setting up invoices, paying bills, and writing estimates. one feature my clients find helpful is the receipt attachment. i would highly recommend this app for anyone who uses qbo.
amazing accounting software for smbs. great capabilities and integrations. only downside is the ios app is not always reflecting all data from the software. i believe this will be fixed soon
awesome product. general contractor have tried a lot of different apps and have spent a few hundred bucks...this one by far is the best for invoicing and providing estimates. very streamlined and quick to learn..
so easy to use. quickbooks is simple to understand and has everything a business needs with easy access from any device. i love how simple it is to use and also can rest knowing there is help on the phone 'talking to someone in australia' if and when it's needed. it covers everything a business needs to run successfully. i wouldn't use anything else for my small business
major problems with the newest update!!!. the app was working great until a few days ago. now i cannot receive payments on my iphone due to a bug in the app and i also cannot send an invoice via email on my iphone or ipad now. ☹️
. dashboard unable to load after dozens of reinstalls, reboots and even on another phone entirely. ever since the new redesign the app has been riddled with intermittent loading of the dashboard to now nonexistent. tmobile, oneplus 6t tmobile, samsung galaxy note 10+
ótimo!. recomendo!!!
missing key functions. whilst i understand this is a mobile app, even the qbo version lags behind in key functions from its desktop predecessors, all of which intuit has had ample time to upgrade to fully integrated functionality. intuit needs to put full functionality above the profit margin and put customers above dollars.
awesome. great program
fix the app!!!. this app use to work great until the last update! please fix asap!
easy and effective. very easy and convenient, would just like if they add the ability to create a purchase order to suppliers from the app.
. free try option does not work. what's the fun of offering trial that doesn't work
solid. i like that it keeps sync of everything smoothly. there's no wait time, and if so i never notice it. it's fast and convenient. best accounting software hands down!
qbo. quick books online is a great app. the ability to have access to business data at all times is not only critical but essential for any business.
. really easy to use
solid app. it works well. highly recommended to business owners.
saves time = saving money. great way to save time in keeping track of your business expenses and income. worth every penny for me saves me about 48 hours a week in managing my books and business.
electrical contractor. we really like this app and all its features. it’s fairly easy. i gave it 4 stars only because it is missing one important feature and that’s appointments. it would be one less app i have to download into my tablet and computer. it’s just a suggestion that would be so convenient all in one( hint hint).
quick book on line wonderfull!. excellent product which works well for my small business. great customer support who have helped me learned about accounting processes in quick books.
awesome but missing bank account integration. very nice to have the books on mobile wherever i go. make invoices, record payments, add customers and service on the fly is very cool. i would like to see the bank account integration like mint does.
. awesome accounting app!
business owner. this is a great product ! i don't know how i would keep my business organized without it. also customer services is awesome. this is a must have app!!!!
. all new version is awesome this app is awesome! when intuit separated the quickbooks mobile app from this quickbooks online app they fixed a bunch of bugs and added a ton of features. if you have a quickbooks online subscription you need this app!
. awesome app
great. absolutely love it! i love the fact that i can access my reports from anywhere, mac, ipad or iphone.
. bank feeds never update. been telling me to check back in a couple of hours for 3 days. resync doesn't work. completely useless without updated banking information. uninstalling and never returning. stick to the web browser bc this app is a waste of my time and space!
pefect. just a fantastic accounting system & app. very easy to use & has all the features you need. transformed my way of accounting.
. great app saved me lots of time
couldn't do without it. the qb on line version has really simplified our operations. the ability to have multiple users from different locations, especially remote access, has made life easier. either using a laptop or my ipad is great when out of the office. the only thing i've found that the app does not allow me to do is prepare a purchase order. but, there seem to be periodic updates so hopefully this will be coming soon. i would recommend qb to any small business.
app isn’t working now. please advise. it has stopped working. i click on the app and it automatically closes. new iphone today should work unless not compatible with ios13.
. just unistalled and reinstalled the app hopefully it is going to work. after doing over 70 invoices it stopped working dashboard showed blank 😕
pretty useful!. i can add my expenses and match them later and now they even. updated the web internet so i can use it on my tablet and it's become super helpful! thanks quickbooks! i think what's they update it to where you can do all the thing you can on the tablet web interface that you can do on the computer it's going to be top notch
great & uptodate!. this is a great little app to give you access into the back end of your quickbooks online account. great for doing simple invoicing and adding expenses. i still use the desktop browser for more complicated reports and such. well done and intuit keeps the app up to date thank you!
qb app for keeping biz virtual!. helps keep me in the know while on the go!
great app but. we need to have the ability to track mileage within the online version. also need to be able to auto fill a lot of data over to turbotax and allow it to do personal property taxes. i think the cost of this service is high for compared to the desktop version of which you can do more with. please work on the updates and continue to offer a great product.
. last night's update totally messed up our county taxes, forcing you to use an incorrect rate, less than the state and county expect. we will need to use a different system now do avoid tax issues.
highly recommend for startups. qbo does everything that i need it to. it is a great dashboard to see where i am at, with the ability to add details to all of my transactions.
. does not support in india
qbo ipad & iphone. i think that intuit is doing an incredible job with this product! the updates have been wonderful for me. i am thoroughly pleased with this product.
"was great until recently. this used to be a great app until a few weeks ago. now, every morning when we go to open the app it states ""downloading company data"" and does this for hours. we have customers needing to get estimates, pay invoices, etc., but can't because we can't use the app! this just recently started happening. qb can you please fix this issue??? this type of problem shouldn't go on for this long!"
. love it. great for doing estimates
useless app. almost no features. not worth using.
. this app has been doing a great job of helping me run my business for over 5 years now, very easy to use. highly recommend
. really quick and simple set up. easy to use. no problems so far. perfect for a small business.
. great app i love it
. very excellent apps
. does not work as advertised
great app. since the last update everything seems great. if an option to maintain inventory is added then this app will be perfect for anyone.
freelance business functions like agency. this app is brilliant. i can check the status of invoices, p&l's, reference invoices, and client trends. best business app i have on my phone!
makes it all the easier. program runs excellent always active on me note 3 a couple of things id love to see added. purchase orders and file attachments to invoices this would perfect it for me.
. sales receipt and invoice not round off available in mobile apps create invoice not show retail invoice and tax invoice in mobile i am a paid version user and i am pc login all options are work properly but mobile apps issue i have made complete 4 tims in call center but agent ask me team work this issue
satvinder. tear 2 help desk software support
. if i can navigate this app, anyone can! super easy and really professional. i'm loving it! i love the different reports as well. thank you!
. great app
love it. small business, no need for a more complicated program, cane send estimates and invoices from my phone. fantastic
don’t use this with an ipad.. bought this app and was unable to get it to work with an ipad. 4 hours on the phone with this company and still no success. they charged me and told me to get my money back through apple. there is an open known problem being worked on their end but user’s beware. you won’t find out until you’ve paid.
. reliable. simple. improves my efficiency tracking receipts.
easy and convenient. as a first time user, both app and desk top versions of quick is easy to use. moreover, the app makes my life much easier. even when i'm out of the office, invoicing, paying, receiving, and quick views of current status can be done at the fingertips.
engaged user who loves the product. team quickbooks, i think you have one of the better products on the market. i would really love to see payroll support on the app or available on mobile devices with your online product. i like the simplicity of your product and the user experience i think is better than others on the market. please deliver either a mobile browser supported payroll feature or even better a app solution now.....
very impressed!!!. this is well worth it. we are more on top of our books. it definitely has been a time saver and we love the pay bills from a click option. i really like the alerts to my overdue invoices too.
great app. quickbooks online works really well, fits my needs as an independent consultant.
been perfect for my business. qb has helped keep me organized and professional while growing my agency. expect for minor tech glitches which are minor inconvenience it's been a perfect tool!
keeps everything in one place. great app! i keep all my business and personal expenses logged and in place from my phone. i can also track multiple companies. gives me so much piece of mind and way easier for keeping track of taxes and book keeping.
. i love quickbooks online. i've used quickbooks pro for years. am now retired but started a similar but now more relaxed field. i would give everything a 10 star if only you would put a time clock in the app. i would greatly appreciate that. would be so handy when i am on a mobile job.
. i would like to create, edit and update projects in the app. thanks
. the app is good. they can still work on some parts to make user experience better.
great. had some problems at first, but i was helped promptly and the problem was fixed immediately. great support team.
still has issues. the concept of the portability is great. but still has stop issues to fix, especially on the android app.
great app. the app takes a bit to get used to but once you've played with it a bit it's very simple to navigate, update bank transactions and so on
dubai. i tried to register dubai address but looks like only us address possible.
can't see vendor activity. needs improvement. when a vendor is asking for info about payment, i can't see any of that info from the app. i have to go into the computer to look at vendor activity, which means i also need to be in a wifi location.
. when we process credit cards ti is showing the transaction being paid. however, it does not connect to gopay, even though we have that function turned on. we did not realize they were not processed completely until we did weekly reconciliation. as of today, this bug has not been removed. 3.8 on our other tablet is working fine.
"not as easy as you might expect. certain things you think you should be able to do like delete a transaction are unnecessarily complicated. also, i feel like there should be ""help"" without emailing someone... maybe there is, maybe i haven't found it yet, but i think the program could use work."
easy and efficient!. the app serves perfectly to capture transactions on the go, snap a pic and enter amount and accounts then review later if needed on a computer. simple, some people expect this to be fully functional for some reason; if you need a fully functional program then you really should have the appropriate expenses towards computers and software anyways. this app makes the book keeping process easy as cake for clients and the accountant.
. since i have gotten this app it's made my life a whole lot better .
crashes. constantly crashes and doesnt work as promised.
muito bom, como sempre!. utilizo o qb desde sua versão em português, lançada pela eversystems, em 1995. sempre o recomendei e agora, após alguns anos afastado experimento nova versão muito melhorada e adaptada a tecnologia atual.
review. not quite as intuitive as i expected but otherwise useful app
does not intergrate with the desk top versions and is way more expensive. i bought the desk top version because i was told the app would work with it. now they are discontinuing the app and forcing users that need mobile access to use this, but it does not share data with the desk top version. it would not be so bad except that i bought and paid for qb for windows 2014 and is substantially more expensive in the long run.
loved it. its very useful app to track expenses and invoice.
iphone x needs ui adjustments. the “accept” button at the bottom of banking transactions is on top of the “home bar” on iphone x please fix the ui so that there aren’t any usability issues on iphone x
dashboard is broken. app needs work.. the app dashboard appears to throw up numbers completely unrelated to reality and almost always reports inability to retrieve all data. the web version, on the other hand, works fine. it seems not much attention has been put into app development. disappointing.
qb online. quickbooks online is awesome and easy to use, having customer information on your mobile phone help save time money and keeps you aware of who has paid and who hasn’t paid anywhere you go, it’s very easy to print invoices to a wifi printer.
. when will you make a self employed app to go along with your web pages. this app doesn't recognize my self employed account.
great app!!!!. very happy with the app works great and allows for same functionality as desk top
. i use this app while i had my quickbooks trial, and it seemed to be working fine. the minute i subscribed, the app stopped working properly. i emailed support, no one seems to be answering my questions, and when i phone the customer service, they don't know how to help with the app. i'm stuck and ready to cancel the whole thing.
no gst only take !!!!!. why is this an option the the web based but not the app. makes the app useless!!!!!!!!!
. does every thing i need it to do, and i can do it on my phone. so easy to navigate. wouldn't want to run my business without it.
not good. app and site are actually kind of bad. slow to load. not enough options. will try xero soon
best business app. quickbooks has definitely made running my business much more efficient and has made it easier to close on deals. the estimate tool makes it easy to send professional looking estimates to clients, and with a click, those estimates turn into invoices. you can receive payments through quickbooks as well. add the payroll service and you can run the whole business yourself. i would definitely recommend this to any new business start up.
. app is ok but the login process is cumbersome. i should be able to access the app with my thumb print every time.
roofing company. the app is great, although it needs an update with bugs fixed. the app won't allow me to modify, save or send invoices. very frustrating.
. still learning the ropes. so far so good. being able to submit quotations efficiently and itemized makes all the difference. quite easy to learn and keep track of expenses.
can't even get in. changed password, tried countless times, still can't get in. this is unreal! please fix this app! !
don’t update. ever since last update it crashes when i try to run a credit card. was talking with customer support for an hour and all she could say is i understand. when i asked to speak to a manager the line was disconnected
slow. can be great and convenient but it can also be very slow (just like the online version). won't always let you edit invoices through the app.
not good for my use. i would like to have a setting to hide all account information so i can have employees out with ipads giving estimates or quotes. this is for personal business. good for that but forget trying to take pictures of receipts to write expenses.. takes longer than scanning them on my pc
. love it, very easy to use. excellent customer service
handy, but needs work. the app is pretty hand for some of my clients to invoice on the go or take photos of their receipts. i find it a little too dumbed down for my uses. i would love to be able to add delayed credits and charges and drill down on the financial statements. it would also be great to pull other reports, not just p&l and balance sheet.
amazing. this app is a life saver! started my own hvac company in march of 2015 and this is the only app i use for keeping track of finances, invoicing, payroll and taxes. it really makes running my business as easy as possible! love it, thanks quickbooks!!
best invoice app available. so far the best, has everything you need and more, it's like everything you pay for what you get.
great app!!. no issues so far. simple to use.
. great app! easy to use and helps me keep track of our church income and expenses.
excellent. the app is a great supplement to the online version when i'm on the road. i easily make customer invoices, add expenses that i have purchased. nothing is lost or forgotten. great way to keep everything up to date
awesome. good app 4 biz
crashes a ton. this is a great app for bookkeeping for my business, but it crashes almost daily on my iphone. please get better engineers for the functionality of this app!! so frustrating when i’m in the middle of printing invoices and the app crashes! how am i supposed to conduct business that way!?!
great for on the go use!. love using this app! great for small business use & being able to use anywhere! with multiple people using one app!!
scope for lots of improvement. given that this app has been out for many years, it seems like it has been neglected. the interface shows it. for example, if we touch a vendor, only the address shows up and nothing else. ideally, all details related to the vendor have to be displayed  po, bills and payments. many such improvements can be done.
cool app. really great app. gives access to everything you'd want to get to from your phone.
doesn’t support enough features in app. can’t generate invoice with cis. not sure i will subscribe after trial.
great app. love having qb on my phone to receive payments, send invoices and other routine activities.
terrible. this software is absolutely horrible. on all platforms.
worth the price. i am a small business owner, i was having to write out estimates and bills but since i have this app....... life is way easier!!! now i have more time to do the work and less hassle with the paperwork.
does not connect to my bank. it connected to my bank (bank united) the first day and has not worked correctly since. i waited on hold for 25min and no help. was told i would receive an email with the solution...no email. not very happy with this product for my first week of using.
useful app. adds a lot of useful abilities to your mobile device. i'm not a heavy user of it, but i have not had issues with it for months using the basic features.
great app. great app
not impressed. started using the app because it was recommended to install it with quickbooks online. the app does not show any up to date transactions that were entered on the quickbooks desktop version, you cannot search by phone number or address only customer name in the app also. i would have thought the app would have been more useful to use while out in the field.
it's good enough. this a good app helps out when in the road.
latest version is a disaster. face recognition does not work at all. you have to sign in every time you open the app and often get kicked out especially when switching between companies. colossal waste of time.
waste of time. glad i haven't gotten past the trial offer because nothing syncs with my quickbooks online. so the obvious question is what's the freaking point of this app? completely unimpressed. someone's making money off of doing nothing. wow. i want that job!
bookkeeping on the go. i own a small tax and accounting firm and this app has done wonders for customer service! being able to give my clients real time information from anywhere at anytime is a huge plus!
nice. so far it seems to work well. the online version on a laptop works better and is much easier to use but the mobile version  minus a couple inconveniences, isn't bad either.
needs some improvement quick books mobile was so much better. when any of my customers get an email it goes into spam and most can't open invoice from intuit sites. one of my customers tried paying invoices from site and that didn't work either. i don't have time to spend all day on phone to resolve continues issues.
great and simple. this is such a user friendly way of doing you booking, keeping your inventory and managing your customers
invoice reminder from app. i was hoping to manage my quickbooks account on my ipad like how i use qkb on a laptop, but it seems like on the ipad version it’s missing a lot functionalities, such as invoice reminder to client. also to set up the invoice reminder. can you please improve this in your next update? thanks.
. being mainly a cis contractor it won't let me make invoices in app so have to use browser which doesn't work so have to wait till i get home to invoice from laptop. any chance of this being resolved. please note i have tried multiple phones and it is near impossible on mobile browser. trying to keep keyboard up is a nightmare.
. user friendly for the droid not so much in the appleipad.
best app ever. i am a tech on the go , and we made the switch from paper invoicing to quick books online. i cannot tell you how much this app saves me on time and frustration , everything is there at the tip of your finger. thanks intuit for making my work that much easier!
best accounting online software. very useful very easy and flexible
handy phone app. the iphone app has come in very handy for creating quick estimates on the road or adjusting existing quotes in the go
vendor purchase no option. it takes so much time for converting the invoice to pdf for printing.
. i am with digital account
quickbooks = easy bookkeepping. love the mobile app, very easy to use. access accounts from anywhere, raise invoices, pay invoices. simplified bookkeeping!!
. just new to quick books and new business owner find it very user friendly easy to navigate and edit without too much tutorial going with basic version for now will upgrade in future.
disappointed.. as a qbo subscriber, i thought i could get basic financial reports like monthly profit and loss... not so. i'm not sure the app is of use to me at all.
"customer service is outstanding.. i'm a contractor, not a ""business man"" by any stretch. but, the qb staff have helped me many times to navigate and learn. kudos!"
still needs work. one thing needed i’d making it easier to change customers info when doing a new invoice for a previous customer but at a new address. i have many customers that own many places and i need to be able to put the address in for each place where the work is done with that same customer and the app doesn’t allow this to happen.
. do not match up with pc i have this on my phone to use for work, i do not have the same tabs as my coworker and we installed the same day. things i put in on my phone do not match what she puts in. she even tried using my phone to make sure i was using this app correctly and it is totally different. how can someone use this if it's not the same from phone to phone or to a pc?
. i have had this app for my business for about 1 year. every time i spent the money new transection comes up 2 time . and it's too hard to remove on transection.
would rate 0 star if i can. only works in trial version. bought it 3 days ago and hasn't work since. i emailed customer support from both itunes and quickbooks with no help. keeps asking me to subscribe (when i already have). i couldn't use it. it's useless.
great functionality. great app! great way to keep up with receipts on the go.
. great app, very ready to track income and expenses. making and tracking invoices is so easy even easier then on the computer, reports and everything is really easy to access and track.
great for invoices on the go. being able to do estimates and have it linked with the office is great.
slow to respond from time to time .. the app is sometimes slow to respond.
always something hidden. is there possible to get something without paying, like an app that i originally paid over 200 ,now to have that app on mobile divece pay again,but on regular basis. why just make an app where i can sync all info at the office or home
great app. can do so much on the app. would be even better if could prepare bills in the app.
works for me. little tricky to set up, that's mostly me. i like it, does what i need.
crashes!!!!. don't update!!! latest update crashes app on opening data download!!! why don't these geeks test these updates before posting!!!!
. this app takes forever to do anything. it literally takes a minute just to open after i tap the app icon. completely useless. information is not reflected correctly during use. just use a web browser instead.
missing some key functions. 2 big gripes: purchases are always entered as expenses, requiring editing if it's a purchase for resale; there is _no_ timer or time sheet entry function. i have to use a third party app for this (tsheets.com, works very nicely)
not so good. it keeps hanging up with an error message not connected to the internet. not very useful for business.
dont waste your time. the support on this app is non existent. signing up is a slow impossible process
. great on the go app
does not function. doesn't load new invoices. app is now useless.
life saver. apart from the fact i have to input my password every time, this app is a great compliment to the version i use on my laptop. so easy to use, can invoice on the spot. very happy.
. sweet app
. very helpful love this app for all my business needs
. makes things sooo much easier and frees up time! no more sitting in front of a computer all day a couple times a month doing data entrybook keeping. very user friendly app and program. only thing i have to log on to do is mark and sort deposits on the sales end.
. great app
very useful on day to day business. makes mobile invoice and payment tracking a breeze
good except.... you can't *properly* enter expenses in the app. expenses cannot be linked to the costs you've already set up, like price per mile for travel, but instead only entered as final price.
crashes on large invoice. works fine until you get a large invoice and then it slows down and or crashes
slow books. can’t accept transactions in banking section. sluggish app, end up using the computer more often.
small business asset. easy way to keep track off all those expenses, invoices, payments etc for a small business owner with little time to spend on administrative stuff.
useless. can not load. i have a brand new iphone. i have tried to log onto qb at home, at work & without wifi at all. i have never been able to log in. it always says downloading company info and just keeps loading. i never get in.
unusable. doesn’t connect to my account.. every time i try to login it says there is no company associated with my account. it works fine through a mobile browser or desktop browser. the app is completely unusable, how convenient. tech support says there is a glitch...you don’t say.
great can scan bills directly with phone. i use phone app instead of pc sometimes, as i can record bill right when i make purchase, complete with scan on receipt. awesome.
"works great for my business needs. i can send estimates quickly and they look professional. one feature i really enjoy is knowing my customer has viewed the estimate! occasionally the ""+"" arrow doesn't seem to respond on the app... otherwise i'm very pleased. dc"
please support iphone x & faceid. please support full screen resolution on iphone x and faceid
smart. a easy and rewarding app
app has gone downhill since update. youve just done an update and hardly anything works. buttons are unresponsive and crashes! sort it out
. great app,
great tool. awesome app, so far so good
. 3 years and the app still doesnt show bills????? support case opened 3 times and no one care. wonder how can we trust them with our data
does most. app does most of things i need for my business. one thing i am requesting for is the ability to pay with a daily rate not just hourly. i have a home care agency and this is how we pay our employees in some cases. lynn
. desktop site works great, mobile site is trash and i can't even log into my account through app. says i don't have an account? okkkkk. tried reinstalling but no dice. i'll stick with the desktop site thanks
crashes. same problem: crashes. looks good though.
terrible. can’t figure out who to call for support. need to cancel account but everything goes in a circle. i hate companies like this.
confusing. the guidance on using the app and getting the most from it is not very good  for someone starting out like me, i'm struggling with this.
new update has stopped my app from working!!!. since the update i now can’t accept anything or change anything!!! the only thing i can do it add the expenses!!!! sort it out please!!!!!
best accounting online software. very useful very easy and flexible
needs a lot of improvement. missing a lot of features and information available with the web browser connection. can't see vendor history. can't sort how inboxes etc are listed. a few other issues. freezes often. in the middle of invoice entry, the system bounced me out for some reason, while not saving the work i had entered to date. did that twice. before i closed out and went to pc web connection. i love the possibility this app offers, development need to fix and enhance
best app for organizing your small business!!. only had this for a couple of days now and just invoiced my first clients. it was so easy to use. i wish it could be personalized more but still overall a great start to my business!
can’t create multiple companies. can’t create multiple companies or entities with this program. i would have to pay a subscription fee for each company. if i wanted to track my individual expense, my business expenses, and my llc expenses i would be stuck for $720 a year when the 2013 version on my laptop could create unlimited companies and only cost $300 paid in full.
nice app. works better than the online version
easy to use. look, read a lot of the reviews and people are expecting their own accountant with this program. it does what is needed to keep your finances in order. if you want 4 ,ill ion graphs to impress and be bigger then you are....go hire a team. great product, easy to use, tracks everything for me, keep my books straight, and recommend it to everyone.
bad. the worst customer service (intuit)
basic functionality. just signed up for quickbooks online. the android app installed fine on my new samsung tablet. no issues running and using app. however, the app is minimal functionality. there is also no good dashboards like the pc or online web version of the program. pretty disappointed being development of such features is not complicated nor expensive for a home dashboard.
terrible. try to do estimates on the quickbooks for ipad. it is easier to do on the quickbooks for iphone. intuit needs to get some people like myself with an office any where that using qb online very hard and heavy to beta test there software.
invoices. i would like to be able to sort the invoices as they come in by day.
overall but problems. overall works well for small business. a lot of problems with checking account and credit card connections. one i am still going to have to sort through to make sure transactions weren't missed, as it only loads back 90 days. and you get no notification if an account suddenly disconnects. its a mess but customer service is good and they work with you well.
excellent. i've tried a load of cloud based book keeping software and quickbooks is by far the most feature rich.
. not free. when it's 'free trial' it's free trial, not free. uninstalled $8 monthly? seriously? :)
good app. no complains
. this makes invoicing and estimates no long such an impossible chore.
easy to use, innovative and mobile friendly. we have been using qb at australiance.com for almost a year and i would not go back to my previous accounting software. the interface with paypal works well and save heaps of time for our online sales. it s easy to create expenses (e.g. business lunches etc), quotes or invoices on the go with the app + always know your bank account position as it interfaces directly with it.
limited. for alot of the functionality of qbo you need to use the web app anyway so i would not bother with this app.
stupid app. and never works right nightmare to login
. this app works good for me
excellent app. cool app to have. no accounting experience needed.
c'mon man. still won't let you attach items. ...... please fix!
great small business tool. very easy to navigate and enter information. i can enter data on my home computer and then access it with my phone when i'm not in the office. great app
...and into the light age we come. the transition from sage to quickbooks was a giant step for mankind. functionality, interface, ease of use, report detailing and having the app on your iphone was a masterstroke. this coming from using sage for nearly two decades.
love it!. best app for my business!
love it!. easy to use, great for mobile business. can create invoices with your own logo, receive payments and log them from anywhere. send invoices as well. i don't know what i would do without it! have a makeup business and recommending to my father too!
awesome. works great never had an issue with yet to date
great that it exists, now it needs to be great. it's so awesome to be able to manage my business from my phone. but. that's not the same as the app itself being so awesome. it's frustrating to use at times and could benefit from some thorough ux work.
. disappointed...like horribly disappointed! this was supposed to make my life easier but instead i lost multiple hours either trying to figure the desktop version out to then trying the app and the tax rate were getting doubled...while chatting with help desk to be told that it would get fix a week after still didn't fix. uninstalled to try to start fresh to realize the price had gone up! chatted again with customer service to be told someone would contact me within 2 hours...still waiting!
. fantastic. best app ever
. i haven't explored all the features, but this app is great for on the fly billing!
awful software. i have quickbooks for years and the service is awful and the customer service reps can't help you. plus read the small print about the merchant account i have been paying 4% on credit card transactions. simply horrible
helps me so much. new business owner, this app has been so helpful. can do estimates send invoices and input expenses from any where, weather im at the store or on the go i can work
new update has me locked out. automatic update to my software today. now i can access my account. fix it now! i am paying way too much to not be able to access my account!
. error code 132.100 quickbooks doesnt even have a fix for it. customer service has no clue as to what they are doing. i like paying for software that i can't use
slow at the app not compatible with ipad. something wrong with this app , slowly uploading and not easily manageable on the ipad
weak weak app. this app is very basic. can't even view multiple accounts without logging out and logging back in. terrible
great app, continues to get better. best decision i ever made for my business was moving to qb online. saves a ton of time being able to conduct business on the fly.
quickbooks fanatic. loving using quickbooks for my diesel mechanic business keeps all my files invoices in order...
valuable tool to have in the field. i installed the app, imported company files from my desktop and boom i was doing estimates and invoices in the field.
fonts too big and can’t be read anymore. since the latest update, fonts are too large and you can’t read the amounts of your invoices anymore. sent them many screenshot examples, still can’t use the app anymore. also, sometimes you can’t even “accept” an invoice on the app as well. useless for me to use now. what a shame, because i used it daily. iphone 11 pro with latest ios v13.2.2
works well but. some features don't integrate with qbo and visa versa. i think this product should be as similar as possible across all available platforms.
simple and good. easy to use. user friendly.
. great app
would have given 5 stars. i love the application. i would have given five stars if it allowed entering of vendor bills. it only allows expenses to be added.
there are other options .... not with the $35 dollars they take in addition to % of every transaction. i would suggest another program and app. i personally would like the app to be able to send reminders for invoices but the app will only send them out.
. this app is great for being on the go. love it!
. i've been using quickbooks for about 15 years. i recently switched from the desktop version of the software to online, and that's ok. this, on the other hand, feels clunky and difficult to manage. i still use it because we're so entrenched in the quickbooks family, but based on this mobile app, i'd definitely look for alternatives of i as starting now.
. it's a great app. i use it all the time with my company. very efficient, and easy to navigate. automatically logs out so no one else can get access to it ( logs out after being in active for a certain amount of time). making banking, estimate invoice, and employees records very easy to keep track of. also love that i can store customers an accept payment online also. only downside sometimes it can be slow but other than that it's outstanding
less than impressed. the interface is way to different from the online version. i can’t even access payroll through the app. it’s way to simplified to be useful. it needs a serious update to be more user friendly
. so you have to purchase the software for desktop but if you want to sync it to mobile you have to pay monthly to use this app? why is this? why is there no onetime fee option?
useless. useless. confusing and incomprehensible.
quickbooks online w app. i have totally enjoyed using this product. they have actually improved through several years of my usage. keep it up and, please keep the price down!
broken. can’t save any new invoice sales receipt... ipad pro iphone xs max nothing works
great app. love this app!
crashes since update. i've tried to create a twoline invoice repeatedly since the update, and it crashes every time. will update review when it works.
. awful, just awful. will log me in then never actually connects to my qb account. utter crap. make a product that works before advertising it on tv.
very nice!. i love have this power in my phone! i can email invoices or print them out, all on my phone! this app is easy to learn and soooooo fast when you get used to it. there was a lot of thinking when they designed this app, wow
the best app for small business owners. i own a small business near austin, tx and i used to have to drive home to write up an estimate, but with quickbooks they have truely made it easy and extremely convenient. i highly recommend this app.
great app!. very userfriendly and easy to use!
great app. app is great and worked well with my iphone x but just updated to iphone 11 pro mac and app will not open crashes and closes every time please fix
. always displays an error when trying to connect to bank for transactions
quality control team is on vacation?. one star to this version because it crashes immediately after i try to open. i deleted it and installed a new version, but same problem. i rebooted my iphone, but same problem. still works on my old ipad because the version is older. force back your quality control team!
. bekar hai do not any mail id login don't open
. i can't even open the app. it just keeps closing.
. very easy app to use, helps keep all my expenses organized.
no mileage tracking. false advertising. the mileage tracking screen shot is from the self employed app, not the small business app
. i have updated my review. quickbooks has made some great changes and improvements. they still have a few to go. but definitely on the right track. i have also had to contact customer service and they were super helpful. thank you quickbooks you have changed my mind and made this a great app. definitely recommend!!!!
best business app. i never write reviews but had to for quickbooks. absolutely love. couldn't run my business without it. have recommend it to everyone.
quickbooks. if you use quick books you have to have this app. its a must have
"keep getting ""session expired"" message with every log in attempt. completely makes the app nonfunctional for on the go business. critical flaw! please fix it!! oh, and the link for support is dead... come on folks, gimme a chance here!!"
. if we can check stock from the apps, that would be better. please consider so i can use it just with my mobile to check everything.
can not do custom invoice numbers. the app can not do custom invoice numbers. i have had the app for two months and paying the monthly fees and have not been able to send out my first proper invoice. i have asked support and they come back with instructions to go to certain settings that do not exist on the app.
no payroll. subscribed to payroll using desktop at the office, tried to access using iphone app on the field but could not find it. waste of money!
. great app but how does it stand out?
. this is a easy to use app and makes keeping track of finances easy
work. great app especially for small businesses
bad servise. have quikbook for 6 month and crash and phone them 10 times my account is on debit order also 5 days later they tell me there nothing they can do for my acount crash i must start over i wont recomended this app
. we're learning how to use. it seems to be very usefulbeneficial. my guys are picking it up quickly. easy to learn
owner. i actually have never written a review for an app, and i've had an every iphone since the 3gs, i read the first review for this app and was so disgusted at the panning i just had to write one in support. i have a small business and use this every day! it's great, well designed and very user friendly. i run a carpet cleaning company and run basically every part of my business with this app.
scanning receipt yet to be as effective.. i was using neat desk for scanning and it captures all bills. if quick book cannimprove receipt scanning for cab and other bills it will be wonderful.
. very user friendly
useless. unless i am missing something i find this app absolutely useless. it does not show all of my accounts, so i can't see the account balances. supplier balances also don't show, if i need to play a supplier. it still needs a lot of work, so i will stick with using my macbook until then. it's actually not even worth using.
online is horrible.. it is so slow and printing invoices is terrible.
. great app! well worth the investment!!
horrible ever since update!!. this last update completely ruined the app.
". does not sync to account. on the home screen it shows i have invoices that are overdue from customers, but when you click on it, it says ""congratulations, no overdue invoices."" useless app"
. was using quick books online on laptop and it was fantastic, now since have to be on the move, am using on my android phone to generate invoices and it amazing experience, just dont need laptop anymore. great stuff. recommend to all smes
. this app constantly signs itself out. it takes forever to load. quickbooks online has been a mistake from the start but i'm vested. its going to be difficult to change but i'm going to find someone else. the iphone app sucks worse.
. hated it, warning, stay away. it mess up my quickbook online, duplicate everything, customer service promise to contact me, never happened. service bad. do not waste your time downloading. app version is useless, synchronization keep duplicates my receipts, and much more issues. stay away from quickbooks app. still not fix customer support ain't helping either, because is a third party app....
limited features in the app. the app has extremely limited features as compared to web cant send customer statements or edit recurring transactions or match partially paid invoices.
. grid great app need estimates though n e one know how to do that other than that great app very easy
handy phone app. the iphone app has come in very handy for creating quick estimates on the road or adjusting existing quotes in the go
o melhor!. excelente!!! minha ferramenta de gestão financeira.
. bad app
good app. good app great for mobileroad sales. only wish i could view current in stock inventory qty in app and product item cost as well as retail price.
. great app easy to use if your familiar with apps
. really easy and all self employed services (invoicing, expense recording etc) in one place
unusable.. i'm required by my work to use this appwebsite, and it is completely unusable. after confirming my account via email and twice by text message i get an error message when i try to login. the website also does not function no matter what browser i use on my phone. what a joke.
keeps crashing. every time i try to upload a receipt from my phone, it crashes when i press save & doesn’t save at all. i’ve tried closing the app & trying again, but it does it every time, so basically i can’t take a picture of any receipt & upload it. please fix!
. great app
"problems. this app will not let me save an invoice, it always says ""this number already exists"" no matter which number i add. only started the error on the 301112, please fix."
convenient and efficient. this app allows me to create invoices and collect for my plumbing services in the field and takes care of the book keeping simultaneously! i can also email the invoice to my customer instantly, which my customers seem to appreciate.
biz essential. still learning to capitalize on having my business so accessible on the fly. i send estimates and invoices before i leave the bid sometimes.
great. app
. first thing i try to do with it and it crashes. crashed 3 times in as many minutes just trying to link an account. garbage
. i think this app is not a bad idea. just that it doesn't have where i could upload my logo. buh all same it's a very cool app
. as a company you are charging too much to have such a lousy application. you can't make any invoices with android phones, it keeps giving me 'error' messages even after uninstalling and installing it a couple of times.
great apo. this app has helped my business tremendously. inna smart phone society this app has helped me capture more clients.
super functional..extremely helpful. quick books app is fantastic! makes using my phone for invoicing and estimates very easy! recommend to anyone..... no glitches, no hang ups..... you won't be disappointed!
really good!. overall i think it's a great app. the one thing i would like them to add is the total dollar amount in the invoice section. in other words it would be nice to see a dollar amount on the tabs for open invoices and past due invoices.
much better after last update. this app came a long way, for canadians its now usable and competitive to the other services, it took a while but its very nice now.
works great, most of the time.. when it works well it is great, and that is most of the time! of course it isn't perfect and hangs up or doesn't update sometimes without explanation or reason. overall worth using though as i do often.
. i had an inapp issue and received help immediately. i love this app and really appreciate you guys. you make my life a lot easier, 💯💯
. the app is excellent!!!
brilliant app. quickbooks is an amazing app. i'm an electrician with a small business, so i need something quick and easy when i'm in the field. entering expenses and creating invoices is so easy on my tablet andor phone saving me hours per week. great work...i'm very impressed!
. ok app email invoice doesn't work version 3.8 been unable to send invoices via email for over a week now.
. makes life easier
app can’t find our data. we are days into this app not being able to access our data: accounting, banking, billing. access is only available through certain browsers on a laptopdesktop. the support team is friendly and wished me luck.
. very useful
. current version leaves the expense input screen up after adding an expense. this can make you double entry as you're left with wondering if the first expense entry went through. otherwise seems stable.
. takes some time to kearn but very good companion to the full cloud app for the laptop
everything i need right from my phone. so handy to be able to do estimates, invoices, and record my expenses right from my phone! will save a lot of time with bookkeeping as now i can enter everything on the go.
good start, needs more. nice gui, great start to all potentialy great tool for business. the app needs more options than just customer billing. thats half of a business. i want to be able to log expenses like fuel, tool rentals, etc via the mobile app as i make those purchases.
. error everytime i log in, and requires password so often. edit: the log in is working, but when i try to add an expense it doesn't save, the same button doesn't work
very easy to use!. great tool and app!
unable to process simple request. crashing and getting an error saying data unavailable. can’t even save one expense
"too many missing features. can't add time entries, even simple ones, have to pay (a lot) for a third party app. not acceptable for a single user company that doesn't sell products, only time that needs to be tracked. can't view current ""sales"" status of unbilled items. can't email myself receipts and have them automatically entered as expenses bank transactions that i've excluded keep showing up. again and again. i'd like to configure away unused modulesfunctions from the menu"
president. i’m busy right now trying to invoice, from customer service to user friendly software qb is on point for the business man. love the service for sure.
. it's a great way to create quick estimates and invoices.
mr dak kanani. very good app
latest update is garbage. update: 1620 still a garbage app even after multiple emails back and forth with quickbooks development team and now it’s been weeks since i heard from them the app still don’t work even after new updates app has been great up until 3 weeks ago now it no longer works! crashes every time i try to open the app.
. great app! still learning, saves so much time.
after 3 years qb stops working. spent hours on the phone with support. no solution. cannot add items to an invoice. i'm a distributor so mobile is pretty important. sorry qb pretty disappointed with your product.
easy to use. the quickbooks app is quick and easy to use.
fantastic job. intuit made an extremely versatile, and wellrun appprogram with this version
contractor. amazing product for having customers and businesses on point and updated on the spot
a solid program. i like the idea of this application being online because many of my accounts can be updated asap.
. quickbooks makes it so easy to keep track of expenses, invoices, payments, mileage... everything really. i'm glad i chose this over the other options.
. great app and also great customer service they answer my questions very fast.
. web version is working but not the app.
quickbooks online app. very simple use, efficient and stable. i have no complaints!
. great app for small businesses
quick books makes my life easier!. doing estimates and sending invoices is easier then ever!
awesome. streamlines my entire business, saves me tons of time, lets me take credit cards, and best of allows me to bill on the spot.
. when it comes to converting an estimate to an invoice or processing transactions, the app experience is excellent and even preferred to the desktop version. smooth and easy to learn.
crashes now. i got a new iphone updated it and installed quickbooks and it crashes every time i sign in.
update needed asap. i also have been using this app for years (it’s great when working properly) but something happened after this last update and i’m getting kicked off and signed out in the middle of my invoices and estimates. it’s staying “an important update is required” or something like that and i’ll go to update the app but it’s already updated! and i’ll log back into the app and get kicked off again with the same message.....
. i have called customer support twice now. each time, i am greeted by an overly friendly person who barely speaks a word of english. either time was the agent able to even understand what i am asking for. they could offer no help, they would not transfer me to someone else. i am left all alone here trying to navigate a program and run a business. i have no idea how to get any help from these people. thank goodness for youtube!
. just got it seems to be a good solid app for me to keep my business running
best. app ever
adding expenses. as compared to other programs such as freshbooks, quick books fails to be quick. it takes twice as long to take a photo of the receipt and input the vendors name. qb please make it easier to input expenses!!
. worst app ever. 0 stars.
. great app
so many glitches. this program glitches at least once a month. today it is telling me we don't have an account. so frustrating. it's great when it works, but it should always work.
life easier. i resisted quickbooks since the first time i used it years ago and it just didn't work for me. but now it's really easy to use except for a few things that the accountant will fix
cant update billing info in app. slow, awkward layout, intelligent prefill of categories usually incorrect slowing down workflow. will be using moyob to set up accounts for my next fy.
app doesn't connect on ios 9. ever since ios upgrade 9.3 and quickbooks mobile app doesn't sign in, always says check internet connection. it's a bug in the app and they know it, we contacted support to fix it and they said they are working on it and will have a solution by end of may. this problem has been on for more than 4 weeks with no solution. poor app with poor support. not recommended at all.
quick books online. good for customer data base. good for invoicing and receiving payments. fair at tracking expenses. near useless as an accurate or bookkeeping tool when linked to a bank account. so many obscure and poorly explained manual actions required that error is easy to introduce and tech support usually makes things worse. one may as use good old fashioned paper ledgers and a calculator. don't trust it with your numbers!
. does what it is supposed to do!
great app!. works great with my quickbooks online, fast and easy for taking credit card payments. everything syncs back to my online account and is very easy and efficient, huge time saver!
really good!. overall i think it's a great app. the one thing i would like them to add is the total dollar amount in the invoice section. in other words it would be nice to see a dollar amount on the tabs for open invoices and past due invoices.
qb online. just upgraded from wui quickbooks pro 2011 to quickbooks online. this program is absolutely fantastic. i love the ease of receiving payments. love that i can take photos of my receipts paid to vendors. simply a great product. customer support was also wonderful in helping me get transferred from 2011
. for almost 2 months i'm not able to save an expense in android app..it's been showing an error everytime i save it.
. quickbooks banking is my favorite part of the app, because it's easy you catergorise all your expenses and incomes. the dashboard shows an overview of your financial situation.
actually professional now. i was using word to create invoices, then excel to keep track of when they were paid. now it's all done in one place and even sends a professional looking invoice to my clients! i should've moved to quick books long ago!
. super slow load time and sms verification not working. it's a joke.
. this company is a joke they will not allow hempbased transactions it is preventing my freedom of doing business the fed has mandated banks take money on hemp transactions
find & reports. would be faster to be able to find estimates and invoices by number. also be nice to look at reports.
waiting for delayed charge on mobile app.. otherwise, its good!
. best accounting app ever
. decent app
little disappointed. qb on the cloud is a great idea and that's why i'm using it. however  wouldn't it be nice if the mobile version dis half what the desktop version does. i use mint for my personal finances and for a free service their app does it all. qb please get some programmers to get this app fully functional! i understand that you may not include every function but expenses??? that's something i expected to be able to do on the road.
needs more. needs way more functionality. too few procedures allowed on mobile app. would have expected more from quickbooks
solid except.... i like that it keeps sync of everything smoothly. there's no wait time, and if so i never notice it. it's fast and convenient. best accounting software hands down! the app is smoother than the mac desktop version, this should be fixed!
. this app is perfect for our small business.
simple, yet capable. does everything i need and i love being able to use it online, iphone and ipad. on the go flexibility is a must and this app does that flawlessly!
waste of space. all we want to do is access quick books online via our ipads. this app is worthless. as my business continues to grow we will obviously be looking for a software provider that listens to clients instead of putting out disappointments like this. save the space on your ipad and don't bother.
cannot edit suppliers at all with the ipad app. i think the title says it all. i started an invoice from a supplier, however i cannot continue it on the ipad. it is just impossible! it just cannot be done. so it is for that reason only i am giving it one star. on the computer it is great, the ipad app is useless.
crashes all the time and there’s no way to ask for help.. this app crashes every time i update my iphone, even when i update the app. don’t even bother trying to contact qb about it, they’ll tell you to uninstall and reinstall (like you don’t know) and then that’s about the extent of their support.
. awful software!! support is ridiculous. 6 month of transactions went missing. now have to buy software for $80 to convert pdf to qbo files and upload manualy. what a mess. try something else, not trust worthy.
. great app! let's me keep up with my business on the fly!
disappointed. do not download this app. i'm sorry i did. extremely flawed.
. this app requires a password even though i chose google login. if i need a password anyway, what's the point of a google login?! quickbooks online doesn't require it. disappointed and uninstalling. i have enough accounts as it is.
biggest disappointment. the biggest disappointment is no ability to do purchase orders. when i’m out in the field this is a huge disadvantage and i still have to break out the laptop!
finger print capable. you can now log into the app using your finger print
make my life easier. it's easy to use and let me get rid of paper work and posting the documents and receipts to the accountant every three months. happy
love it. this makes running my bookkeeping busy very simple!
. excellent app makes having a small business so simple
. poor. this app worked fine for 2 years and now they have recently removed the feature where it automatically adds receipts to transactions. the support morons keep telling me it never existed in the first place but i used it for 2 years! i'm now looking for another app to use in it's stead. avoid it at all costs.
love it. easy to use and understand. have recommended it to everyone i know. great app.
love this app. works great and i can navigate and make invoices and track everything in one app! i love it
super. idéale pour les entreprises de services étant souvent hors du bureau. facile d'utilisation et très complet. accessible via pc, mac, iphone, ipad et sous androïde également. quickbooks en ligne est tout simplement génial.
. i am not happy they changed my mailing address in my invoices with out my authorization. my payments are been delay. not happy with them right now
best way to keep track of your expenses. i love this it works very well a little hard to learn but very simple to use what you learn how to do it i use it to track all my business expenses and it works perfectly i love the touch id lot it keeps everything very secure you cannot go wrong with this i absolutely recommend it for small business owners and businesses in general
app issue’s. i purchased a new ipad pro 12.9, i downloaded the quickbooks app. on the left tab when i would select sales it causes the app to crash. i tried deleting the app and reinstalling the app and it did the same thing.
awesome app!. great product, has everything our small business needs, saved us a lot of time transferring from one program to this. reconciliation is a dream, so simple and easy to work out. have had no issues whatsoever and am very happy with the change over, has made life so much easier. 👍 thank you
no grouping of customers or invoices. services that the regular version have.... i don't know why they didn't carry this over. if u have more than one customer base or if u need to send the same invoice to multiple customers you are out of luck. hope they fix soon very annoying
. growing to like this app
keeps crashing. for the most part, the apps work pretty well. however, for whatever reason the app on my iphone crashes every time i login the first time. it gives me an error saying critical error please sign out. most the time when i sign back it, it’s ok after that. but usually requires restarting the app.
horrible!! worst waste of space ever!. would give negative stars if i could. absolutely horrible app, can't do a damned thing; can't enter or edit or view bills, can't enter new customers, can't enter new or edit existing invoices, can't enter new expenses or edit existing, can't enter or edit payments. can't figure out what this is supposed to do except take up space and cause frustration. do not waste your time downloading. like others said, use excel and a shoebox.
best accounting app except for some glitch. it is the best accounting app that i had so far. i like the inventory part. what i don't like is that the activities for the suppliers are empty but with the web and desktop app the activities appear.
error!. somthing isn’t working and there is no support from the developer online :
very easy and great!. i'm not a accountant but i found this app and the software great
. so easy to use, i have a specialty coffee roasting business, this accounting program is so easy to understand from day 1.
awesome app. helps with all business expenses and just great interface
more than convenient, it's necessary. having the app makes it so much easier to do business on the go. you can send estimates and invoices before the client meeting has even ended. efficient and essential!
. great app
. great software. made my life much much easier!
. nice but needs more. as a bookkeeper, i love quickbooks online because you can access it from anywhere. i like this app but wish i could deposit my payments and see my register. i'm so busy that it would be nice to do my personal business on the go instead of from my computer. i hope that these features will be available soon otherwise i will have to cancel after my 30 day free trial.
horrible app!!!. online service seems to work good but use my phone a lot on the go!!! can't do any billing from app anymore!!! really hurting disappointed!!!! who do you talk to about this!!!! i give the app no stars
they do not fix bugs at all.. constant new annoying bugs that have been around for years now. i have written multiple times to help make them aware, now i have been writing complaints and still no fixes. am literally logging into the app every single time i open it. i have to use this app for my work. no choice. but if you have a choice then you should choose literally any other app. this company is terrible.
defects still in app. app was brilliant until it started alerting that my trial expires so need to upgrade when i'm on a full package and not trial version? fix needed intiut.
easier than i thought. works well for what i need it for, and makes tracking accounts simple.
. cannot login. uninstalled and now cannot reinstall
great for handyman businesses. qb is great for me! i run a handyman business and my office is at my clients place or in my truck. i can sent estimatesinvoices while i am on site. it so nice because i use my tablet or phone when i’m on the road and when i’m home i can use qb on my computer and everything is automatically updated
. great app, can generate invoice on the go and get paid!!!
no mileage tracking. false advertising. the mileage tracking screen shot is from the self employed app, not the small business app
excellent app. i used to use invoice2go and since moving to quick books online it makes everything so much easier i can sync to my bank accounts and this itself is saving me time reconciling is a breeze now.
. great app to finish your business when not in office
. subscribed at the top tier quickbooks subscription, but i cannot check my inventory on the mobile app. i cannot express how sad i am, that should the first feature to ever be implemented but its just not there.
don't believe the negative reviews!!. i think the application is a huge time saver. works great on my ipad air 2. i strongly recommend this app! it's like getting a full time bookkeeper for only $30 per month! i like having my business records semiautomated in the cloud. intuit offers a 30 day trial. why not just try before you buy? that's what i did and i haven't been disappointed.
". downloaded the app to be able to view estimates and invoices from phone while i'm away from my computer and someone calls wanting to know ""how much did we have in this job or that job"" well, the app is prettt useless when you have hundreds of estimates out and you're trying to find a particular one , but there is no ""search"" tool to look for what you're trying to find."
could be better. it's good for entering payments, that's about it. and even that is a stretch because half the time it shows invoices are unpaid in the app while the desktop accurately shows the same invoices as paid.
. i have had repeated issues with credit card processing off mobile in clients homes. embarrasing to repeatedly attempt to run their card, only to have to make phone calls after to see if their card was run twice. emailing receipts does not happen everytime. trying to email receipt and system keeps telling me that new information is available, then nothing. often will not process payments while with customer. overall system is pretty good to work with. still recommend qb.
. the support team helped with my expense logging issue. awesome!
quickbooks online. don't usually write reviews but this app is definitely worthy of a review. if you are in the market for an invoicing program this is the only way to go!!
log in feature.. new version requires you to log in each day, while this may not sound horrible, this app was created for ease of use. previous versions required you to log in once, then your finger print or 4 digit passcode would suffice. please bring that back.
. it's not perfect yet, but does what i need invoices and sales receipts in the field that i can print with my mobile printer. the recording part isn't as good as my desktop version but i know with time it will be improved.
. great app once you get use to it. very handy business tool. changed my review from 2 stars to 5 stars!
. app crashes a lot. several times after updates are made to the app it will crash after i have to sign in again. now it just crashes after i try to sign in.
. the app is very good, keep improving to give us the latest version
efficient app. as a bookkeeper i use qbo for all of my clients as well as for my personal account. it just keeps getting better and better. accepting transactions is a breeze as is setting up invoices, paying bills, and writing estimates. one feature my clients find helpful is the receipt attachment. i would highly recommend this app for anyone who uses qbo.
. this is a great app and makes it easy to do so many parts of your bookkeeping through your phone. quickbooks online has been such a useful tool, and this is a great part of its use.
. the service online is terrific. the app errors anytime i try to update from my smartphone for over a month now. support is unresponsive via email.
limited. not much functionality compared with the desktop app, frustrating. unable to access banking or create bills.
clumsy, error prone, price has doubled.. not a completely trash service, but it hasn’t gotten any better despite company promises. price has doubled since i initially joined. ipad app bugged, today i tried to enter an invoice payment, no joy. tried to leave service last year and the year before. exporting info was a nightmare, and impossible on mac, effectively leaving me held hostage. cancelling service at end of year as i’d rather try a different online accounting or simply go with a desktop version.
crashes and fails. it crashes, it fails and it's not as good as invoice2go sadly.
. the desktop app is great, the mobile android one is bad, it freezes all thr time, crashes, doesn't work.
so easy. this app is user friendly and intuitive. i like being able to see the reports and add attachments to expenses. highly recommended for small businesses owners.
. easy to use. does what i need it to do
. downloaded this app 3 times and still close as soon as it opens. hard to use in the field if i can not get in.
good app. it's a easy app to use.
. great app for small business. easy to use and saves me a ton of time doing my accounting. accounts payable and receivable couldn't be easier. i really like the free bank transfer option i can provide my customers in their invoices. taxes are quicker and easier thanever everything is in one place and no more collecting receipts. i highly recommend quickbooks to anyone running a small business.
. this app is useless and doesn't work properly on a phone
. very useful app.
. so handy. like having an accountant in my back pocket.
fantastic. this program is fantastic! i use it to run my wife’s business and our clients loves it
. continues to make me turn phone off and on or delete app it does not work.
recent update. worked great until most recent update. can't create new invoices now. when you save it says it's saving but then just stops.
. it's a decent app. not quite a full model with some basics left out. also, they need to make it available for kindle.
small electrical business. this software is perfect for anyone starting a business. it keeps everything organized from billing to customer records.
does not do simple qb tasks. this app does not have all the functions as the computer online version. i can't run simple reports and the payroll app which is separate does not allow me to make changes to the employee information. doesn't function like you need it to and it put me in a bind when i went out of town with just my ipad. i would not even give it one star. worthless.
qb online. very very good in all aspects of accounting. from home office or mobile app. you can do it all!
"buggy, issues with sync. for some reason this app is constantly having connection issues for me. i get messages like ""transaction not accepted"". then i have to log into the desktop version to actually do the work. ok for a glance but not useful for productivity."
o melhor app. o melhor app para gestão empresarial simplesmente nunca usei algo parecido
. i can't start trial.... coz if i choose company name,it will vanish...
capable. qbo mobile is quite useful for billing customers on site and checking some basic information.
. app doesn't want to update. i need to use it now not later. this is unacceptable.
great app. this app is a life saver. they have done a great job with it. i have tried all kinds of other apps and this is by far the easiest to use!
. many bugs, and any receipt photos are too low resolution to be readable.
. i don't seem to be able to login with google. is this supported on the mobile app (android), like it is supported on the website?
"""great for working on the go"". perfect way to send estimate and generate orders. obtaining signature on phone great for pod, just like ups. it's worth the $10 a month. thanks quick books!!!"
easiest accounting on the go. makes it so easy for me to handle income and expenses for my business no matter where i am.
great for businesses on the move. makes invoicing easier if not in office all the time ,
. worst app don't use it. it shows us a very professional look and feel but truth is that it doesn't work in android mobile in india and online version of desktop is totally sucks just because it is very slow. these peoples are making fool of us totally.
never worked. downloaded app but it has consistently failed to open. only the message 'unfortunately quickbooks online has stopped'. tried all the suggested work rounds, uninstall, clear data, clear cache. called help centre and their agent couldn't have been any more disinterested. appalling customer service. not worth subscribing. dreadful service.
. you don't need to understand double dutch accounting to use it.
where are the invoices??. what is the point of an accounting app that does not show supplier invoices? dreadful. support was as helpful as a chocolate teapot too ...
love it. i love the quickbooks program because all of my employees can log into the program from different locations at the same time. it works great with my small business to easily access invoices as well as the payment logs.
downloads. automatic downloads have been taken away, you now have to go through the print page to save as pdf, then name the file and save from there. where as it used to automatically save and download with its own name. this app is getting worse.
disappointed. i just switched from my trusty iphone to an android phone, this app on my iphone was perfect! it had a list of products and services, unlike the android version. it also loaded all the estimates and invoices for all my customers, this android version hardly has any of my past transactions! please make this like the ios app!
bad update. used to work good until last update now when i open the app is says downloading company data, gets stuck there for ages. if it finally loads, there are no customer invoices, just payments. tried deleting the app and reinstalling but does the same thing. the pc app works fine and my employees have samsung phones and they haven't complained of any issues may just be an iphone app problem.
. moderate user, nice to estimate and invoice on the go
. an amazing business tool. once you learn its functions, it's like having a professional cpa 247 for all your financial accounting needs! highly recommend this app.
awful app  doesn’t fully sync with online data. i keep getting notifications about a 6 month overdue invoice, which i used for testing. however, when you try and remove the invoice, it can’t find it. the online version is fine if a little overpriced for soletrader business, but this app, which costs nothing, is worth exactly that. it’s next to useless.
best accounting software. so easy to use. has so many features.
keeps crashing. i am trying to use this app on my s7 on sprint. everytime i log in it crashes and ask to send crash report. ive installed it a few times now. please fix bug.
great app. the app takes a bit to get used to but once you've played with it a bit it's very simple to navigate, update bank transactions and so on
don’t bother downloading!. this app was so hard to use, wouldn’t connect to my bank, wasted so much time trying. brought up all of my personal accounts transactions even though i asked it to hide them. wouldn’t bring up transactions older than 3 months. i honestly don’t understand how anyone can use it!!!
. hasn't worked on my android phone for over a week. says error syncing data and rarely loads historical info. lost ability to photo invoices and seems to have lost tax settings as always wants to create them despite setting this up and using for 7 months now. support says they are aware and working in it for a week now
very disappointing. they frequently change the interface and items move or get hidden. e.g. customers formerly in the dashboard hidden in sales. frequently i quick on a document on a list and the wrong one opens. lists open in various formats for unknown reasons. my favorite lines of invoices disappear when i switch browser tabs to get more order information. hard to believe quickbooks has such a good reputation.
needs work. this won't stay up to date with online or desktop app and i regularly get error messages. this is frustrating and useless.
crashes w ios 9. app crashes after you enter password. intuit has had 3 months to test on beta. customer service has no idea what ios 9 is.
the best way to manage business. i love it and i can control how i ran the business easy and fast way to keep track of my expenses and income
. just an overall awesome experience i just wish they will have the invoices forwarded in backwards so we can go from invoice number 1 to ingles number 2 and 3 and so forth
compatibility issue?. no problem installing it on my phone but will not install in my tablet, says it's not comoatible (both v6.0.1 marshmallow). what seems to be the problem? huge disappointment from such a well known company!
security update  unable to sign in. since the security update for sign in features i'm unable to sign into my account using the app.. defeats the purpose of having it aug 23, 2016  just redownloaded the app and have full access once again. oct 20, 2016  unable to select cash, check or credit account to pay an expense.
. good value for money, easy to use most the time. only frustration is needing to be online when using and in our area we haven't got a good connection.
no multiple account support?. would like to give it a better rating but without multiple account functionality it's value for me is limited. otherwise good functionality.
"best app tool for small business. i love everything about it. just please change when emailing estimate, remove ""please pay"" and change to total estimate as it is only estimate and not an invoice."
unable to process gratuities!. the biggest complaint from my clients is they cannot pay extra for a gratuity. huge problem!!!! when can we fix this?
good app. works for me.
new update is awful. the newest update is so awful! i can't post things on my invoices, i can't email invoices, nothing! it acts like it is doing it, but then it freezes and tells you to refresh before making changes. i refresh, make the change again, and it gives me the same message again. awful update!
can't set it up. tried to get this to work but every time i go to the web page t set up the account etc it just sits there white a spinning timer at stage 2 of 3 of the setup. tried loads of times but just won't work. think if i ever get this working my first invoice will be to quick books for wasting so much of my time
great app. this app is a great supplement to the mac version very very helpful
crashes all the time. no matter what version this is, it always crashes on me. i never use this this app, although it would be fantastic if i could.
. easy tp learn and use
love but.... great! except would love to be able to make a deposit with the app
getting too flaky. i’ve been a subscriber for about 2 years now but am now randomly getting locked out of the app where it thinks i don’t have a subscription! i’ve reported the issue , it always gets resolved but then returns ! went to do my accounts and quotes this weekend and guess what .... i’m locked out ... again! is that acceptable for a business app ! definitely not.
good but needs multi currency. very easy to use but multi currency is a pain. i’m based in us but invoice in uk, mexico and spain and with quickbooks you have to be 100% one currency so it’s a pain for my customers and makes me look second rate as a “in global” business
crashes. crashes immediately after i open the application. update was recently done and now i can't use it.
great app. i love it. great!
. this is what happens when a company gets too large. first app worked fine and then suddenly refuses to connect to my bank. customer service is a joke. reps were unable to figure out why error 103 kept appearing. after two hours on the phone i was then told it is a systems issue that needs its own ticket. two days later an email arrives stating that the issue is resolved. guess what, it wasn't!! come up intuit! you can do better than this
error. can't even log in:(
. bank feeds never update. been telling me to check back in a couple of hours for 3 days. resync doesn't work. completely useless without updated banking information. uninstalling and never returning. stick to the web browser bc this app is a waste of my time and space!
new update is awful. the newest update is so awful! i can't post things on my invoices, i can't email invoices, nothing! it acts like it is doing it, but then it freezes and tells you to refresh before making changes. i refresh, make the change again, and it gives me the same message again. awful update!
brilliant. excellent accounting software for new small business. only issue i have is that i bought a subscription online and the app keeps telling me to subscribe
. having issues with the app and no help!
amazing. this app is amazing work flawlessly
new business. i just opened up my business and i'm being super careful of keeping track of all my financial expenses and sales. this app makes it easy!
excellent. does everything i need & it synchronizes with other apps i use.
. dreadful experience so far. bought qb 16th dec 2019 and cant get a call back from an english speaker to help me with set up despite multiple attempts! why is sales uk based but support isnt? this is 2nd review  1st disappeared!!! so disappointed and very desperate to get started.
. app stopped syncing transactions, useless!
expenses off. expenses are off. it’s showing expenses from an inactive account on the app. it’s correct on the website, so it’s definitely an issue with the app. i checked and the settings are the same. both should be displaying expenses for this month.
great program!. super convenient and easy to use.
subscription error. while i love the program, it had cancelled my subscription and won't let me do anything. get this fixed and you'll be back up to 5 stars.
recommend!. quickbooks is a must have to swiftly complete business tasks like, estimates, invoices, etc.
. i am happy with the app. it means i can get work done in the field.
great app!. very userfriendly and convenient. great for people who are needing to create invoices and estimates and track expenses. the iphone app is fantastic!
unusable. doesn’t connect to my account.. every time i try to login it says there is no company associated with my account. it works fine through a mobile browser or desktop browser. the app is completely unusable, how convenient. tech support says there is a glitch...you don’t say.
for last month since major online update its is useless. when i login it tells me i don’t have a subscription. i call support they tell me to uninstall the app and reinstall. after reinstall the login works but you cannot switch between your companies. i called them back. they said no one else is reporting this. three users in my offivr are having the same problem. i love the iphone app for entering receipts on the go but i can’t even do that now.
fast and easy. makes life easy not having to reach a computer to send an invoice!
little disappointed. qb on the cloud is a great idea and that's why i'm using it. however  wouldn't it be nice if the mobile version dis half what the desktop version does. i use mint for my personal finances and for a free service their app does it all. qb please get some programmers to get this app fully functional! i understand that you may not include every function but expenses??? that's something i expected to be able to do on the road.
qb app. this app worked fine but up until this recent update there are a few glitches and it shuts down in the middle of updating and invoice!
. super easy to create sales receipts and track sales and taxes. i love the option to include sales tax. i'm sure there are many other useful features that i'm not currently taking advantage of. thank you for this app!
easy to use. maybe better than the desktop app...
so useful.... i don't really use it like it's designed. i have 50 company trucks & 5 semi trucks to keep track of at our repair shop. this allows me to document everything. each vehicle as a customer with year & type always easy to find. each invoice acts as a repair, allows me to document every detail and track costs. luv this app! well worth the subscription fee.
this app is a business saver!!!. this is a must app for every business!
instant customer service 👌. great app for small to mid size business. phenomenal integration from windows 10. so far so good. thanks.
. perfect for anyone in business. easy to learn and navigate. my clients love the fact i can give them a written proposal or invoice on the spot.
the best for small biz. to be able to login and get to your quickbooks anywhere is awesome! if you love the ability to work at different locations using dropbox because your files are where you need them, this is the same level of mobile convenience because your data is always where you need it!
crashing. i’ve had constant trouble with this app crashing on me off and on for months. now it doesn’t work at all, even after i deleted the app and redownloaded it. no one can help me.
works great. i live how i can edit and emails invoices on the go. as well as having all my credit card processing all tied in. so customers can pay invoiced from the actual invoice and not have to include other services.
great app for independent contractors. qb helps me stay on top of my invoices and keeps me organized.
zero stars. it really surprises me that a big company like intuitquickbooks couldn’t come up with something that worked. the app is almost completely useless. i installed it, tried to do some basic stuff on it and couldn’t so i deleted it. please intuit you have to have someone that can build you a better app!!
half way. all i really want is something i can scan in my receipts with. they say they have this feature but they don’t. even the free wave accounting app has this feature and now i’m left wondering what the point of paying for this service is with an alternative such as wave.. not looking like i’ll be bothering to continue after this free trial if they can’t compete with a free alternative otherwise quite functional.
. very simple and intuitive to use both i've used the android version and ios
. it's not perfect yet, but does what i need invoices and sales receipts in the field that i can print with my mobile printer. the recording part isn't as good as my desktop version but i know with time it will be improved.
. it's been years and the login still fails 80% of the time. have to clear data in the app just to login. it's a nightmare.
. now we can update our financial data but still miss so many report.
easy and friendly. so far i am enjoying the app and it's easy to understand platform
nice and easy to use. i have try this app. as a startup owner, it is very good to generate estimate & invoice
. excellent including mobile app
. am happy that it allows me to.make estimates from my mobile phone
quick and simple. simplify your life!
"love this app. it is so awesome to be able to login to our accounting software and services do an invoice right from the service location we just finished up on... i can actually send a store manager a estimate sheet as a ""what was done  sign off sheet for his record in the case of a corporate billing. i am so glad i chose qb's online..."
. it used to be a great app. but they even do not allow me to login anymore.... i did change the password so many times and did uninstall and install the app. now, i need to go back to my old iphone or lapy for my bookkeeping:(
i'm underutilizing this app!!. this app is way more capable than the extant than i'm using it for! the best version of the app is on the ipad. the worst version is on my mbp.
. cannot cancel subscription been trying for over 2 hours i will have to go to bank and change all of my account numbers because of this plus redo all of my direct deposits and all of my auto pay bills ..do not fall for this app
efficient. this app makes my life easier. has all the features i need to keep my business running smoothly.
fixed bags. quick response in fixing the bags on ios 9. will keep you update....
superb app. works everytime for me, allows me to update invoices, expenses and record payments.
backward compatibility entrapment. i thought i’d try the trial online plus version after being happy with essentials. was not advised during the offer that going back meant having to reenter much of my historical data manually. now i pay for features i do not use or like. their help desk just kinda said...’oh well’. they didn’t even offer to extend the trial offer incentive that had me curious about the product. intuit calls it ‘stickiness’. i call it entrapment.
game changer. changed the way i handle my business transactions. from a simple to complex my invoices and estimates are presentable, traceable and accounted for. my reports help me secure loans in a flash. and my accountant loves me.
. i gave it a week b4 i changed my rating my qb is now working perfectly no more stress on updating my sales n payments... thanks team 5 star well deserved
. good app wish it had a feature to scan in receipts otherwise it has been super helpful
useless out in the field can't work off line. useless out in the field can't work off line and constantly wants you to refresh data. does not support star portable printers. waist of space on cell phone gave it a second try useless creating a invoice have to use search window to find items. had to go use desktop instead of my ipad pro because would of took all night to do a invoice.
awesome. very good app
. it's a great app
adding a photo to a receipt should be simple. apparently there was a recent update that removed the add photo option to tranasactions. it's not there any longer. i called support and they tell me i have to create a note, add the photo to that note, then go find the transaction and add the note to it.
. recent updates have greatly improved this app! it used to be hard to switch back to it if you opened another app, but that's now fixed. i love being able to invoice customers right away, record an expense (along with a photo of the receipt) and take a payment.
mobile invoice and so much more. great app!.
help. there doesn't seem to be a way to tie in purchases on to a invoice to charge specific customers. when you call in for help with the app, customer service does not have access to see what you're looking at.
. worst app ever. unsubscribed after week as the app wasn't what i needed. charged anyway after unsubscribe. tried to reach customer service by chat, the chat keeps disappearing until the moment that doesn't work at all. horrible
. easy to use. mobile app is good for searching previously created invoices. i prefer desktop version for using all other tools.
". sucks!!! i've tried 8 times to sign up for the free trial & an ""error"" always pops out... :p"
outstanding app!. owning a small business has enough headaches as it is. with quickbooks, estimating and invoicing projects and services couldn't be easier! everything is streamline! here's a look inside my day to day as a landscaper using quickbooks: initial client meeting> estimate delivered before i leave the property.. bam! they call back that night or the next day and we have the job. after we finish the project, turn that estimate into an invoice on site.. bam! paid! $$ in the bank!
. quickbooks is an easy way to estimate invoice and send them to customers i enjoy this app very much
nice app... i love it.... it helps me keep track of all my company needs... don't have to pay anyone else for what i can do myself... definitely recommend
. an absolute must for small business.. and seek advice from tech support before assuming. functionality isn't there. ive had no problems... gives me confidence in my books
i recommend for on the go companies. i have been using the app for a year and it has work great for me no downtime and easy access on my phone. great app!
invoice won’t work with ios 13. i’m trying to put a new customer in on a invoice and the app just turns black and white screen. plz update! i run my entire business off this app
. this app is horrible. why make something so bad? it needs a complete overhaul. i can't email receipts to an inbox, income transactions don't show gst amount like expenses, i can't view pdf receipts. it's just all round ugly and cumbersome and i've only used it for five minutes. i thought the xero app was bad but it's 5 stars compared to this trash. deleted.
good app. does all the basics and then some
not bad however. could we have a fingerprint scan to open the app as a measure of security please!!!
needs better support. i thought this was a great app then it wouldn’t allow expenses to be uploaded, one of the main reasons for using this on the mobile app, support we’re worse than useless and could give no time scale as to when this would be fixed to a small business working on the go this defeated the whole point of using a mobile app, am looking for alternatives
. does exactly what i need on the go.
. just was on hold for 20 minutes and the issue is not resolved. the app is not allowing me to save information. also the online platform is not working with third party apps with the new tax rates in saskatchewan (reciept bank) been waiting for that fix for 3 weeks.
5050. good tool but it's slow in the network and chews threw battery.
. both the desktop and the mobile app are unstable. if i decide to stay with quickbooks and that's a big 'if' i will return to the regular desktop version. the gui sucks and is not intuitive in any way and the help section is inadequate .
. great invoices tool
great mobile app. while i m sure they will continue to make improvements it is really good right now.
disappointed. this app falls short. for one you can't see inventory. can't create po. can't enter a bill against a po. on the online version one cannot enter a partial bill against a po. cannot creat inventory level alarms. come on man!
cogs. i need to be able to track inventory and cost of goods on my ipad like right now, please
transformed the way i do business. quickbooks online combined with the quickbooks app have changed the way i do business. i don't have everything figured out but that is on me to get sorted out. very flexible and stable.
o melhor!. excelente!!! minha ferramenta de gestão financeira.
very nice!. i love have this power in my phone! i can email invoices or print them out, all on my phone! this app is easy to learn and soooooo fast when you get used to it. there was a lot of thinking when they designed this app, wow
. it's a very powerful program for small businesses. love the variability of online to where you can use any device to accomplish tasks
stops working too often!. not a bad way to do your estimates in the field and send out invoices but your app stops working way too often for us company wide!!!
mr. doesn't work on ipad pro or iphone. it says my subscription has expired. i have had it for several years and it still works on macbook but on ios it thinks i am on a free trial until 13th april but still locks me out saying i need to update my subscription. it is useless to me if it won,t work on ipad because i photograph all my receipts into the app. will cancel subscription if it doesn't work soon.
quickbooks mobile app crashes continuously, unusable. the quickbooks mobile app crashes continuously and is totally unusable in it’s current condition on ipad. frustrating and we are planning to switch accounting app companies, after years with quickbooks program. intuit seems unconcerned with fixing the problem that has been plaguing our recordkeeping for weeks now.
banking synchronisation. the level of failure is becoming unacceptable. every update from quickbooks results in failure. then there are the occasions when the bank upgrade and qb does not. we rely on you to make it work seamlessly and always.
. hated it and when i tried to cancel it took them 20mins and had me on hold. i do not reccomend!
good. great product however cannot get online payment via paypal to work. also would be convenient if could add accounts via the app and not need to log onto computer.
. hasn't worked on my android phone for over a week. says error syncing data and rarely loads historical info. lost ability to photo invoices and seems to have lost tax settings as always wants to create them despite setting this up and using for 7 months now. support says they are aware and working in it for a week now
works well. works great across all devices. very convenient. great time saver. excellent app.
. very intuitive and easy to use. always improving through frequent updates.
terrible. try to do estimates on the quickbooks for ipad. it is easier to do on the quickbooks for iphone. intuit needs to get some people like myself with an office any where that using qb online very hard and heavy to beta test there software.
terrible app. absolutely terrible, even harder to cancel, don’t buy
love it. i am an accountant and this is the software i use and recommend to all of my customers.
. just starting out with quickbooks. i noticed that it lets me know whether an account holder has seen my invoice. nice! i'd like a little more guidance on using it to track my money, though. i feel a little in over my head.
. explain to me why i cannot screenshot anything any more? i have multiple customers that like to see their over all balance owed but now i can't send them a screenshot anymore. so you update the app to fix things, manage to mess up the one feature that worked best for me and still haven't fixed th spelling on the word supplies (it's literally spelt suppliea). great job!
works when you're on the go!. easy app navigation. easy to create, send,invoices.
great app. best app ever for a mobile business.
fast and efficient time saver. works a treat across all my devices, keeps my accounts up to date and all invoices issued in a timely manner
quickbooks. great accounting app, been using quickbooks for years now and it keeps getting better. i would be lost without it. so easy to use with great tutorials. i'd highly recommend.
. app doesn't want to update. i need to use it now not later. this is unacceptable.
keeps crashing. crashes every time i try to delete an item from an invoice i’m creating.
great for small business. tried 30 day trial. can't wait to purchase! love the ease of doing my daily paperwork.
useless. all i want is to do, while i am out and about, is enter my expenses and take a pic of the receipt and sync it. not even close to happening with this app.
great app. does everything i need it to do. it's fast and laid out well. works great on my samsung note 3. but, don't forget to log out, because i quit the app a day ago, opened it back up again today and it brought me back to where i left off without authenticating me again. glad i didn't lose my phone in a cab! it did not time out and log me off my session. other than that, it's great.
they got it now!. the online quickbooks works great. thank you. this app is really working and syncing, good job intuit.
superb!!!. this is a great app for keeping up to date with accounts. links to my bank accounts and intelligently matches transactions and remembers previous matches and entries. certainly deserves the name quickbooks based on how quickly i can enter my bank transactions. great for multiuser access and very easy to set up. overall this is much better than i expected.
dirty tactics for subscription. unsubscribing to this app is so difficult. an error prompt always appears everytime i process unsubscribing. but if it’s any form of purchase, upgrading, downgrading, anything other than unsubscribing works just fine. no reply from their customer service since i contacted them a few weeks ago. i hope other people who has the same problems with this app comes forward so this developer stops milking money from unwilling customers.
accounting on mobile. great set of features. like the expense tracker. wish it had a mileage tracker within. otherwise 5 stars.
android function. i would give more stars but i didn't because i can't get the suppliers details and transaction from my android device i have only customer details since its avaliable in the iphone i expect to have it in the android application as well
. much easier than using the mobile site on my phone and very convenient for sending invoices
timesheet and expenses. it would be a great app if our employees could access and input timesheets and expenses. maybe one day.
. useless wont connect to hsbc to import transactions, then locks you out of internet banking very stressful wouldn't recomend.
makes my work easier and faster. this apps worth every dollar i paid for.. it makes everything easier and faster
won’t load in ios 13. need an update. ios 13 crashes. won’t load.
works good for me.. for myself a small company works well for billing on the road. was able to download and email general information to acquire a business loan while on the road. not as customizable as some accounting software bit still great for the price. support is alright. i have talked to someone quickly every time i call during business hours.
. really like the taking pictures of receipts. mobile app is great
doesn’t work with ios13. pls fix
easy to use. makes life easy for tracking all business expenses and payments
great app. quickbooks have a fantastic app with full functionality of the browser version.
easy, quick & thorough!. love this online version! i've been using it for my business for over a year! we send out about 100 different invoices every month and it's great!
great app. love having access to most of the same functionality as my laptop
. great app, very ready to track income and expenses. making and tracking invoices is so easy even easier then on the computer, reports and everything is really easy to access and track.
great  when it works.. app crashes often and has trouble down loading data
". i appreciate this app and it's helpfulness, but i really wish it had customizable ""favorites"" to make your selections from to make the entry easier and more streamlined"
qb online has changed the way we do business. qb online has changed the way we do business. we own a pottery studio, and do not have a fulltime bookkeeper. as a small business owner that employs only my husband and myself, qb online with apps for iphone and ipad, have made bookkeeping quicker. it has also improved our estimate and invoice system.
. great app i love it
very nice app. easy to use makes life lot easier and saves time
awful. slow, takes ages to load photos, can only load one photo at a time. constant errors where the invoice will be paid twice
great app. the app is great, love what quickbooks has done. but please update the widget, it's worse than terrible
crashing. since moving to iphone11 pro  the app keeps crashing. can’t even access it! please fix this as i have to upload receipts to my laptop to add to quickbooks! ain’t nobody got time for that........
recommended. fantastic app, very handy and easy to use
qbo ipad & iphone. i think that intuit is doing an incredible job with this product! the updates have been wonderful for me. it would be 5 stars if i could make bank deposits as well!
. garbage. doesn't even have a spot to track vehicle expenses. in the self employed version you can. but you can't track hst. would be nice to have one option for everything.
. two favtor identification doesn't work, i can't login first time
bad user interface. the service doesn’t fully integrate with mobil usage. paying for the payroll service and can’t even use it. garbage, waste of money.
“critical updates”. face id does not work. every time i try it tells me there are critical updates and i need to log in again. there are no updates, and it tells me this every single time.
can't live without it. i don't know how i did business before this app. i love that i can access my company books anywhere. i love the way i can take a photo of the receipts for my expenses. thank you qb!
it's a good app. it would be even better if it would have the tax info. in the drop down menu, that way i could pay my taxes from my mobile device 😕
. best accounting software! worst customer service ever!!!! hold times are hours & when you finally get a person, which is a miracle, they get offended if your upset & will hang up on you!they do not want to help you, just keep you trapped in their maze paying that monthly (rediculous) price! all they want is your money! & will hold your important business info & data entered as ransome. *horrible business practice*
my experience. quickbooks is a system designed for people in business to streamline there activities. in doing so allowing their accounting processes to flow more effectively. quickbooks has changed my business dramatically. thank you
too much and too little.. the various plans either offer too many bells and whistles or not enough basic functions for a small company. tons of redundant functions, and glitches are rampant. and quite frankly, except for the 12 year beginning subscriptions, the plan prices are overly expensive. cannot recommend this programapp at all.
doesn't work. won't open on the ipad
it fits my needs. keeps all my customer info stored so i dont have to input it every time
. very convenient for recording expenses on the go
some great functionality some really missing.. i don't understand how i can add a bill from a vendor through the app. and i can't see some really important reports either. two of the big things i would really like to do with mobility.
forces login twice. app started logging out after i log in. forcing another login. worked great before that.
quickbooks  issues and problems. i thought this may be reputable like the brand. boy am i surprised. can't even call to get proper support. they think that a 48 hours turnaround on a request is acceptable these days...for your important accounting software. give others a look first, this online version is lacking what the desktop has.
great, but can learn from others. just my observations: mobile app should be mostly used to record expenses. it lacks ocr tracing. moreover scanning a receipt is a multistep process. should add forcetouch to add receipt (open in camera). invoices: been searching how to add my banking information. cannot believe quickbooks does not allow for adding banking information to invoices. did i miss something? or is it a hidden feature? not very intuitive (pun intended). otherwise good. like the integration with bank account.
always crashes and says critical updates are needed.. constantly crashing. new photo software sucks. can barely recognize the edge of a receipt against a black backround. have to edit every single photo.
. awesome awesome app.. could use the date option for invoices though
. slowly improving gets better and better, though slow to do so...
. non function cant gain acces to app kicks me to google play store. cant make invoices cant get paid please fix immediately
owner. this software has been the best ever. it has made my job so much easier and faster for billing.
. would love to know how this app works but as soon as i open it... it crashes. if you guys fix it ill adjust my review. but until then. you suck
. good app
for last month since major online update its is useless. when i login it tells me i don’t have a subscription. i call support they tell me to uninstall the app and reinstall. after reinstall the login works but you cannot switch between your companies. i called them back. they said no one else is reporting this. three users in my offivr are having the same problem. i love the iphone app for entering receipts on the go but i can’t even do that now.
great app. great app for busy people! this is really useful for trades people and consultants. highly recommend, super easy to use
efficient app for business bookkeeping. great for managing a solo business
. loved the experience.
. convenient app works great
amazing. at last i can invoice on the move and do the rest of my book keeping as i go. great app and easy to use.
. great app. could do with some improvements which i'm sure will happen. my biggest problem is you can't update your banking transactions through the app, you have to use the website. if you click refresh, nothing ever happens. it's annoying to have to go to the website.
. live this app
. i only give 5 stars if the app gives me free food.
. app doesn't work. it loads then an error message pops up. i've emailed a couple of times but no response. very poor customer service.
awesome. i have an hvac business and everything in this app is awesome. the invoicing,estimates,collecting payments, emailing invoices or estimates, the whole thing. my wife does the books and she loves this version of quickbooks better than the pro version. i can access it from my ipad or iphone and my wife can access it from her samsung phone. all around great app. you do have to have the quickbooks online version on a computer and it has a monthly fee, but well worth it.
pretty good. i'm a musician. very convenient for tracking my business. would be even better if it tracked mileage to and from my gigs. then perhaps a report on that too. otherwise, great!
". seems ok, but missing the most important feature that i'd use such a mobile qb app for: please add the ability to add ""single time activities"" to the app. that way, i can add my times while ""in the field."" am i the only one who really wants that? thanks in advance!"
great accounting software. i previously used myob, thank goodness i changed to this  it is light years ahead and is saving me huge amounts of time.
"convenient. having a small business can be challenging...a customer requested a copy of invoice to be resent from my office.... ""i have no office"".....downloaded d app and baam, job done....awesome!!!!!!"
impossible to print packing slip from app?. i would give quickbooks a 5 if it wasn’t so dang hard to print a packing slip from my phone either through the app or quickbooks online. ugh.
. has made my life much much easier please include income list
okay. i'm new to doing my own bookkeeping and find this product clunky and not very easy to use. issues with importing transactions and program changing dates and the order compared to the bank. it's not very easy to see what account transfers are moving tofrom. it's hard to distinguish credits for debits. poor customer service. no good summary graphs. slow to attach receipts. multiple clicks to do basic things. cuts off file names if there too long.
". the information syncs between the app & the quickbooks online because it's all saved in the ""cloud"". i used a more primitive system before this and wasn't sure how it would work, but i must say that i wish i'd done it years ago. i love quickbooks online. the desktop version is a bit easier to use, so i input from there and access the information whilst i'm out on my phone. it's really easy to resend invoices or quotes whilst i'm out. awesome!"
wow, did this app save our business. we are in florida and have had no power or internet for over one week. this app saved our real estate rental business. everything you can do on your desktop, you can do with your ipad, using this app. all customer data is stored on the cloud. this app is mandatory if you get hit by a disaster!
. great with invoices and estimates on the go. and i can see our sales dashboard wherever we go.
. this app is terrible. they keep increasing the price but the quality doesn't change. i have to go on the desktop to attach pdf files. i use to be able to attach pdf files from the app but not anymore. each upgrade gets worse and the price keeps going up. still they keep asking for my feedback. it's the same. once i find the time to switch in done with quickbooks.
extremely disappointingfrustratingnon user friendly. qb online has been very disappointing. the quickbooks apps for ipad and iphone are incapable of accomplishing anything. it has been very very frustrating and i would not recommend.
. i don't know why i didn't get this sooner very easy and i love that i can track my expenses and do my invoicing on the go.
keeps crashing. i absolutely love this app...but since ios 13 install every time i go to use it, it crashes. i sent an email to support but need this rectified. once that glitch is fixed it’s a 4.5 star app!
proadvisor. love using this to service so many clients at once. truly has made my life so much easier being able to work when ever i am needed!
pathetic. a company like intuit making such lousy app... unbelievable! 😠
makes it easy. quickbooks has done nothing but make my life as a new business owner a breeze. i can expense purchases, write up invoices and so much more right from my phone when i'm out of the office it's amazing. i don't know where i would be without quickbooks
unable to login. trying to login on iphone from my user & password but unfortunately unable to do. the same user & password is working proper on my pc. kindly resolve the said issue at the earliest. thanks.
great app. i was only half way pleased with the app before. but with the new upgrades and changes, it is almost fully functional! it is so nice to be in a meeting with my partners or accountant or client and be able to look up data on my iphone. so worth it... i love it!!!!!!!
. very user friendly app.
always have problems. this application made only to collect money from us and every time they increase their monthly payment always have errors and problems and now big issues that i can not open the application on my phone and no one reply to our email or calls they are totally worst customer service ever
. recently broken. was using this daily on my samsung tablet but as of a couple days ago it stopped working on all my mobile devices. i've sent feedback within the app but still broken. it's frustrating as a paid subscriber to qb.
owner. so far so good i've noticed it runs way smoother on apple products than any other
. if i invoice a client and they mail check or hand me a check or give me cash i cannot record income unless they pay online bank transfer or credit card. so i cannot accurately. so this app is useless. and horrible client management. also need to be online no offline input. also i cannot merge to qb app each charge 9.99 month. cannot merge date as qb has better customer tracking. also neefs time tracking for jobs
perfect. i migrated over from the computer version and so far it's awesome. i went out and bought a verizon tablet to make my billing easier in the field. i now can do everything before i walk out of the customers house, the days of going to the truck to write up a invoice are over!!!
. it's super annoying when you need to use it for issuing 1099s, or for anything tax related. it constantly makes me relog even though it's an app, on my phone, which also has a password. very irritating. finally i'm absolutely sick of seeing and hearing their stupid ads all over the place. unfortunately it's the most convenient program available, which isn't saying much, but that's why i didn't give 1 star.
. simple and professional.
can't login. can't reset password
love this app!!!. it's come a long ways in being user friendly. i do wish you could have the access and control you have from your desktop to at least review your reports. see your registers.
owner. great app
work as expected. good apps
. good app
almost great. so, the limited features in the app seem like just a lack of time to include. otherwise, easy to use, and great way to keep track.
simple and easy.. great program, easily accessible. this program does seem a touch too simplified, and an enterprise version that runs and feels like this would be great.
good but not free. 30 day free trial 😣
business owner must have. great app to work on the go. create, modify and email invoices. keep track of anything financial on your handheld device. fully automated office on the go for the busy self employed entrepreneur.
amazing. amazing app i use it for my online business
works and convenient. easy way to enter sales and expenses. i've had no problems with this app.
. great software. made my life much much easier!
awesome. pretty awesome app. i run a small cleaning business and very versatile.
app. grate app worth purchasing i'd recommend this to anyone
. help me alot
app does not open. after the latest update, the app does not open. it has been a real inconvenience.
. all the hype and there's no where or way to cancel a subscription.
broken. i sign in and all it does is take me to a screen that says it isn't quick books mac. the only buttons on the screen either take me to a webpage saying the app isn't quick books for mac or takes me back to sign in.
love it!. exactly what our company needed! easy to learn and use. have not encountered a problem yet! love quickbooks!
. well after the experience so far it's great when i need to merge all apps at home then i can rate better. customer service has been just awesome so far. thanks it makes tracking expenses easy as taking a picture and putting the irs info in.
highly recommend. i highly recommend this app. i run my business with quickbooks online and use this app daily. i use it to create estimates and invoices mostly but also look up look up costumers balances and run reports.
easy to use so much detail!. i like that it can be synced with my crm & shared with my accountant!
. can retrieve the old account but it won't re activate. created a new account and password.. can't log in. seems to be an app issue or software
perfect for my accounting firm. love this app! it's perfect for my accounting firm to track our books and clients. i even like how it works with quickbooks online accountant. 5 stars for all.
locks up. cannot load company data. does not work since app update.
. this is by far the best accounting apps i have ever used on all of my devices. freaking awesome!
why the love. app just doenst work well  slow and just not a great experience.
quickbooks. this app is excellent and the version on my computer is even better save's me hours when quoting well worth the money.
useless app. used to a quickbooks user a couple of years ago, and it was ok then, but now i have recently returned and find it rubbish. a simple thing like adding a company address is turning out to be an impossible task. total waste of my time. it you are a small business using the app via iphone or ipad forget it. stay away
beautiful app, curious about next features.. the revamped qb online is really attractive. still people coming from the classic qb are missing features. qb uses a great system to allow customers to vote for features. the success of the online version will depend on how fast qb development will be able to produce the big wishlist of new features.
mgrm. great app. useful and easy to use. sample and easy to use
it just works. see above. in the office, on the site. wherever. i have used a broad range of applications over the last 20 years in business and quickbooks is the simplest, functional piece of software for our consultancy business i have found. happy to recommend it to other small business owners who want to spend time in their profession and and not on the books.
too sophisticated for just personal budgeting. i have been using quickbooks since 2006 and its predecessor before 2006. i only use it for my personal budgeting of 14 bank accts, 10 mortgages and 6 credit card transactions. sometimes i cannot figure out how to enter a transaction (transfers between accts, accepting matching transactions, credit card individual transactons versus balance payment) without creating a double entry or it cancelling out an entry. love, love, love the online version that i can access via iphone.
great app but it buggy with lollipop. not able to use this app anymore when my samsung updated to lollipop. bummer!!!!
very easy and convenient!. i love having the mobile app. it makes it easy to enter transactions on the spot without having to stop and open up my computer to login.
the worst customer service ever. don’t waist your time. trust my word. update. i’m paying for 3 of the same app now and still can’t get any help.
. i would give at least two more stars if the app actually lets me use my card reader, followed by the lack of automatic syncing and not even using active price rules whenever i need to make an invoice for a particular customer. please fix the card reader settings at least.
. very confusing
. customer service is absolutely horrible. signed up yesterday online. found out customizing invoices function has been broken for 3 months. call this morning to cancel subscription and get a refund. they're answer basically was we've got your money we're not going to refund it. you have been warned stay away from quickbooks
indispensable tool. all business owners should have a mobile app that makes finances easier to manage. this is one of them. thank you intuit!
essential tool. this app is the greatest tool for invoicing.
. update 2020: since the last 2 updates, the app is broken now and does not work at all. can't log in, and just get a 'device appears to be offline' message.
since last update app is glitchy. usually this app works great but since last update it has a couple glaring glitches that make it less then desirable to use.
great app. awesome app for entrepreneur business.
getting better with every upgrade.. great app. they do lure you with the free use then hit ya with the charges later. i think it's a useful tool in the toolbox.
quick booksamazing app..!. please mail to this id anuhari036@gmail.com excellent app to work...it's really very useful to me...can you please tell how to invoice? thank you quick books for this amazing app!! it's really very helpful..!
no pdf attachment. 3 stars as the app only able to upload photo of the invoice, not other format. you need to understand that pdf is much small in size and more practical for mobile upload. as for photo, it is at least 3m nowadays and it took almost 1 min or 2 to finish the upload.please look into it in next upgrade
". getting this message last 3 days. ""there was a problem syncing your data. wait a few minutes and try again"". please fix this"
perfect app for any small business owner. as a qbo pro advisor my opinion may be somewhat biased but i can not brag enough about the software, customer support and resources offered by quickbooksintuit. qbo has allowed me to become a completely virtual bookkeeping firm, increasing my service area, customer satisfaction and turn around time. love love love them!!
. on the android version i can't go back farther than 12 months to view invoices. also adding discounts are not easy, so there is a delay in sending invoices until i get to my computer.
quickbooks app. i like the app except i can’t seem to add accounts to the chart of accounts.
handy. easy to use and makes logging expenses a breeze
i love this better than their computer program!!!!. i love this app better than my computer program they have, it's easier to use & easier to track your expenses & sales. i recommend this to all my friends that basically run their business out of a vehicle saves on extra work when you get home.
excellent. great mobile app from intuit, quickbooks online is great and although a bit different from the desktop version it has improved the way i work with my clients
. i've been trying to use this app for months and months. it doesnt work, and nobody has done anything about the problems even though there are numerous complaints and bad reviews. i'm getting ready to stop paying for quickbooks and find something else. i mainly wanted to us the app for taking pictures of receipts, but due to the syncing issues, i can't submit more than one receipt picture without the app hanging or freezing. i've tried reinstalling, clearing cache, etc. with no luck.
overly complicated for sole prop. this app is useless for simple small business money in money out, it shouldn’t be this hard and definitely not worth the fight
update is buggy. the latest update won't save invoices correctly and doesn't pull up all my clients names. i hope it's fixed soon i use it daily. also won't allow touch id or pin sign in!
"complete shit. developers can't seem to get it right.. going from version to version will cause problems logging in. might as well not offer as a mobile app, ""on the go"" my ass. i was told ""we're working on"" (for the past 6 times i inquired) then the last time ""too bad, use the web site for now""."
. this app is awesome!!!
great enhancements. i can now create or edit invoices and send them with preview to my tenants. fantastic upgrade.
service date. been told by intuit several times that service date will be available on invoices almost a year ago....still nothing and it is crucial to have in the lawn care biz
quickbooks online + app. quickbooks online is making my business accounts so easy. the bank connections feature allows you to sync online accounts straight into your account records. when new transactions are available, you can view and add them straight into your accounts, made easier by quicbooks match feature that marks transactions with previous similar transactions. support during setup period has been excellent which has made switching from another online accounting software quite an easy process. very impressive so far.
great app. first time business owner and have to say it's a great way to stay organized
intuitive. great app! love it!
. app is constantly crashing.
. i have already paid for this software and it would be great if this came free as it does with my security and vendors software. it is not worth $9.99 a month when i still have issues with it.
. i travel for work and this app is awesome. i can write and email estimates, invoices, and recieve payments on the fly. it makes my life way easier.
. love the convenience of quickbooks app. makes invoicing and everything else so easy!
best business finance management app period!. bombdiggity
so so. the app is not the greatest. i've worked with better.
. does not work for this guy.cant even link my bussiness account to it.worthless waste of money.i feel scamed
. i have had this app for my business for about 1 year. every time i spent the money new transection comes up 2 time . and it's too hard to remove on transection.
. unable to log on anymore from one device, support seems unable to help me. also very disappointed i can't make an invoice in a no service area and have it sync up later. called and emailed support twice now and no updates or response in over a week.
. app runs extremely slowly and often won't even open. it freezes almost constantly. using a galaxy s8 phone.
. quickbooks is rubbish, i have literally wasted days of my life trying to set it up to work efficiently only to hit endless glitches. the last straw was that it lost information vital to my business and therefore money because of lack of clarity on the app. beware 'edit current' actually means actually means change template and loose all previous information. quickbooks don't care about the individual and have not compensated for this.
what happened to this app??. the quickbooks app used to be a 5 star, user friendly, reliably functional app. since december this app has had issues with freezing, crashing, randomly logging the user out and overall has ran extremely slow. i’ve noticed this on the app for mac as well. while trying to run a business, it would be really nice to have a working invoice and bookkeeping app. please fix this
great enhancements. i can now create or edit invoices and send them with preview to my tenants. fantastic upgrade.
different. this is so different than qbo that it renders itself useless. i cannot rely on it for any accurate information. the only feature that is good is the receipt capture.
easy to use. very easy to use compared to other programs i have tried.
great app. easy to use!
simply works. it does the job. would like to give 5 stars but unfortunately the app still doesn't allow me to work with multiple currencies.
awesome app!. started my business with the start of this app since i'm a mobile mechanic and it's awesome to do quotes and invoices on the fly makes it easier to keep customers
. i'm an owner operator in the trucking industry n i'm new at this so i have one question.witch qb is better for wat i do qb accounting:invoicing n expenses or qb self employed:mileage tracker n taxes
messed it up with update. i don't like that invoices send through intuit, nor that the app no longer integrates with gmail for emailing clients. please get rid of the pretty colors and fix the functionality. this update really makes the app much harder to use.
so necessary. if your an small business owner quickbooks is an essential tool that makes it all pain free. you can even invite your accountant into your books and let them get the info they need easily. great software!
latest update crashing on iphone 7. great improvements in the app. extra features are a great bonus. well done. on iphone 7 the app crashes when upon opening banking is selected. i've reproduced 5 times.
. how about an update to the other app? suggestions that have been requested: 1) access to notes! 2) insert item above or below another on invoice. 3) merchant services integration. 4) take photos and attach to customerjob. 5) time tracking, the ability to punch inout for appts. 6) signature capture...things to be fixed: 1) map link still populates the customers name in the search (this was supposedly fixed, but it isn't). 2) support for custom fields on templates 3) editing of invoices and
. it wont open. keeps playing up and wont let me cancel my subscription
lacks functionality. i used to use a desktop version and wish i hadn't switched. i can't easily add interest to late payments, can't track vendor insurance expirations. doesn't seem like much to ask.
. love the app! easily work from anywhere!!
super functional..extremely helpful. quick books app is fantastic! makes using my phone for invoicing and estimates very easy! recommend to anyone..... no glitches, no hang ups..... you won't be disappointed!
. good app gives me all the basics on my phone
we be removing from my ipad. while it allows you to look at a couple of reports, the entries do not link to account activity, making the app useless for me. i will be removing it from my ipad.
scope for lots of improvement. given that this app has been out for many years, it seems like it has been neglected. the interface shows it. for example, if we touch a vendor, only the address shows up and nothing else. ideally, all details related to the vendor have to be displayed  po, bills and payments. many such improvements can be done.
. truly powerful software! takes a bit of getting used to, but once you grasp how it works, which is relatively simple, you're able to meaningfully track the financial health of your business.
ios 13 crash. an awful app that is made even less useful in ios13 because it just crashes straight after running.
great support. we use the app almost exclusively to keep our business mobile. recently had an issue and contacted customer chat to get it resolved. they had me screen record it happening and said they would push to engineering for fix. honestly didn’t expect anything fast but they fixed the issue and included it in the new patch. it’s been about a week or less so a big thank you the support teams for getting it fixed and getting us back to normal.
. wonderful app! extremely helpful when needing to createsend an invoice on the fly
. fantastic app
three years using qbo. very dissatisfied.. bugs and more bugs. slow and clunky functionality. bait and switch pricing. no way to communicate effectively with qbo as they are pro forma all about feedback and customer service however the poor souls tasked with providing it have no two way communication with the people who actually code this bug ridden system. i am actively looking for other solutions that provide ipad and iphone data entry.
online user. i find this program easy to navigate then the desktop. not as cluttered as the desktop compact
excellent. does everything i need for my small business and allows seamless coordination with my accountant.
. perfect app for small business owners. combines accounts receiveable and bookeeping in one.
. as a small business owner it is very easy to balance the books and to get paid within the same app.
owner. app is a great convenience
sucks. i've been customer for 10 years and up and out of the blue ask me to verify my account and every time i called no one was able to help after 4 tries. finally, after 1 and 12 months finally got fixed.
. won't let me unsubscribe to the app so stuck paying a monthly subscription for a service i don't use. there's better completely free apps out there.
great app. i wasn't sure how much i would use this app, but the ability to check status of accounts and stay on top of basic needs while out dealing with clients has me sold. could have more functions but i'm not sure it needs to.
. i like it makes my life easier
. i've used different accounting software to see there was a difference in the softwares. well its a big deal. never will i stray again!!
. epic cnc on the go with inuit quickbooks very nice app. couldn't do it without having it. very light... no heavy bog on my android devices nor google chrome. integrates easily with contacts making implementation super easy and painless. love the feature of being mobile and could based however the online version is definitely different from the software. intuit is doing it and doing it right!
. easy to use. make business life easier
customer files. sometimes all the estimates and invoices don’t show up in the customers file when i go into it on the app.
. great app
. i can not believe that this app is this bad. i can only see customers invoices that i have been to in last 2 months. i use to be able to see 10 years worth of invoices. please fix asap. unless you can carry a laptop at all times which is not practical this again is useless. hello quickbooks how about a fix?
user friendly. love quickbooks still getting used to everything it offers
research before you buy. program works ok but has a high learning curve. also apps have restrictions on what you can do. cannot post new checks in apps. cannot log onto the website from a mobile device. reports are limited. i do not do invoicing and use it mostly for my accountant, and i'm still learning so the final jury is still out but from what i've seen so far i can't give it a higher rating.
needs work & capability. for those of us that work on the road and try to reconcile books daily, do not depend on this app because it is nonexistent. no reconcile function whatsoever. i hope their team listens to our feedback because we can jump ship on any given day.
great app!. this app has saved me tons of time and i love it!
bad customer service. they are not helpful. they made a mistake to deactivated my account, after my complaint, they asked me to key in every single invoice again. this is unacceptable.
great software. this does everything i absolutely need it to do. i wouldn't use anything else it's easy to manage they have great customer service and i don't have any complaints about it keep up the great work thanks for making my job a lot easier.
. excellent app. i've been self employed for many years but have only starting using quickbooks recently and it saves me so much time...
user friendly. quickbooks has saved me so much time and stress! i have a small business and tried excel and failed miserably. but when i switched to quickbooks it took me no time to figure out it could do everything i needed and more! also the customer service is wonderful, anytime i have called for help because i'm terrible at technology they walk me through step by step without making me feel stupid. i'm so happy i switched to quickbooks!!!
. 2 weeks into using this app it has made itself unusable, going back to paper invoices thanks quickbooks!
love it. done right.. finances done right. only quirk is the need to type password fairly regularly, plus only prompted touch id some of the time. apple watch app often wants me to log in on phone first.
easy to use and great features. i moved to quickbooks after trying xero, and find it at least as good for my needs and much better value. good foreign currency support, which is important for me.
. perfect, paperless invoices and perfect for on the go businesses.
looks great!!!. keep the updates coming! great job of being quick to update the app and user interface and continuing to add great features!
very good app.. really like this app.
great app.. great app
great app. thanks for the update. touch id works now and i'm not getting asked for my password all the time. would like to be able to enter my time though!
. so far i haven't enjoyed this app. you can't scan a receipt with details auto uploading but you can on the selfemployed version and also had no luck at uploading a file into an expense when manually loading details from a receipt.
convenient app. fast and easy way to update my account plus banking syncable
. invoices can't add cost except discounts to my invoices using my s4 phone.
ok. good app but there're better ones
quick books. this is very easy to use and it's great. with my iphone, ipad and mac, it updates any changes made and works great. thanks it is made invoicing easy
i run my biz from the app!. i use qb constantly to invoice clients and log incoming checks. it's great for following up on past dues & creating invoices on the go.
just that little extra insight into what's going on.. really enjoy the overview access to invoices(my transactions). helps me to better manage what deals i have actively running and what's gone overdue. real estate agent.
touch id is pointless. needs work!. the new update was supposed to fix the touch id issue. you can log in via touch id. however if you kill the app or restart your phone, you need to log back in using your password. what is the point? i want to log in via touch id everytime. that's what it's there for.
waste of valuable time.. all i wanted was a simple app to send 1 (one) out of state customer an invoice at the end of the month. my other 2 (two) customers don't really need one. took an hour to set it up and a couple more to figure out i was declined. just wanted something simple.
. very limited features and too slow. even after 6 months of using they've not provided the payment gateway integration as available in others. no one handles the queries seriously after 5pm on phone call.
suits me. so easy to use, perfect for my tiny business. don't need accounting skills the workflow has been designed very well and support is great.
worst customer service. i love the idea of the app but it’s too confusing i don’t get a lot of the options and customer service i barely understood anything was no help at all. i just simply needed the app to track incomeexpense and personal pay.
useless. why even bother with this app? i can enter a bill from a sub or supplier on the website or the mac app but can only enter paid expenses here? i can do everything i need to do with my business on my iphone without carrying an ipad or macbook air except use the quickbooks app to enter or actually pay bills (only able to record bills already entered as paid). please fix this (or just tell us you’re not fixing it) !!!
app crashes in ios9. this app was working great before the recent update. app just crashes when i try to open. i use an ipad 3rd gen running the latest version of ios9. please fix!!
. worst app ever!!! when logged in only options are help, feed back and something else so unnecessary. you're suppose to be able to scan your receipts .. nope!
". updating my review since the login issue has been fixed. the quickbooks app it has been very useful for my mobile business. i'm glad to see they finally made where i can attach pdf documents to the invoice. the only thing i i would like to see updated is when the customer signs the invoice it currently just shows their signature, i would like it to say ""signed by:"" and even be able to type their name as signatures are virtually impossible to read."
. clean and intuitive great app for in the field estimates, this is probably my favorite feature. payment entries for cash payments is handy onsite as well.
will not stop asking for a review. trying to get work done and having to swap back and forth between invoices to get the numbers. made difficult since every time i switch back and forth it asks for me to review the app. well, there you go, 1 star, now let me work.
quickbooks online accounting software.. this app is not a doubleentry system accounting app, but rather a singleentry bookkeeping in which you only need to log each transaction of income or expense once, in the way quicken and other check writing software programs work,
. this app works perfectly for making and sending invoices, addingediting new items, reviewing bills, etc. i haven't figured out how to download an invoice as a packing slip...sometimes i need that function, so have to go to my computer.
slow to respond from time to time .. the app is sometimes slow to respond.
logs out every time  please fix this!!. for the last few weeks every time i login it says there are critical updates and i need to log out and back in. every time. nothing changes or updates. very frustrating.
. can't view emails that it sends, it doesn't track when reminders are sent on past due invoices, you can not offer multiple terms (i.e. invoice net 30 but offer a net 15 discount if they pay early). tech support wait times are extensive (40 min on one call, 20 min on a chat). all that and it's expensive.
. was working for a couple months. now i can longer link to my bank account and the app constantly freezes with either a blank screen or white screen. completely useless..
movement through fields. i love the app but it takes so much more time than through safari, enter or tab should move through fields looking forward to this fix
will not let me access my info!!!. ever since i got new phones for my technicians ,samsung s5, i have not been able to access any of my customers, transactions, or invoices. i use qbo for my business, but have now lost all mobile capabilities. if not resolved, i will be forced to use a different accounting software. 5 stars if working properly.
design and functionality is poor. the pin code doesn't work. i have to refresh data most of the time. crashes a few times a week. trying to edit description or client info is a pain. here is another update ok the app. it says clients have paid invoice on my phone when they haven't app is frustrating to work with.
can't save my invoices!. my app auto updated. now i can't save my invoices on the go. i use this app all day, 6 days a week. i'm in the home services industry and i can no longer invoice my clients, which means i can't collect payment either! get this fixed!
bull. don't work. won't let u log inn. all bullshit. i'll stick to the one that works. invoice to go
the convenience of this service is worth every penny. without this app, i would often forget to log in after a job and record my time on an invoice. now, i can record billable time, field notes and expenses as i perform them, and email the bill to my customer upon my departure. the only thing i would like to see added is a way to record mileage as miles.
keeps me on track. i'm so happy with qb. makes estimates, invoices and takes payment. that's what's most important to me. haven't used it to pay my bills yet. i'll explore it later. wish i could set alarms to do estimate followup. would be so helpful
. i have always been loyal user of qb. this app is great.
update broke. i cannot accept transactions. the only things accessible on the baking screens are back and trash. please fix otherwise it’s useless.
very frustrating. i can't understand why quickbooks refuses to put time tracking in their mobile app. time tracking is weak at best on a desktop but excluding it on mobile makes no sense. as a graphic designer who only sells time, this is close to worthless.
. love the invoicing on the go. it makes my customers happy.
. i've been using quickbooks for a few years. it's been great. but lately i haven't been able to access old invoices or quotes. very inconvenient for past work that we've done. now i'm having a huge issue with latest data not syncing to my device and can't even get into my account. things should be getting better not worse. i've consulted with customer service which hasn't helped either.
this app is harmful. support is useless or you really can’t recover the emails you sending to the clients with your invoice
. it works only ok. if there was a better 3rd party app, i'd use it. most of the time i'm frustrated using this app. either buttons don't work, attachments don't save, or some other random instability. i want to do more with the app and i want it to work every time. the design is questionable too. why are things labled differently than in the full version?
it's functional. we should really be able to sign in with our fingerprint. all the other financial apps are up to date. get on it. otherwise all the other features i need to be portable are usable so far.
app constantly glitches and it's very slow. i've had so many issues with this app. lately it has been extremely slow, it randomly shuts down for no reason in the middle of inputting a transaction and it won't load larger invoices. i'm very disappointed as i use this on a daily basis for my business.
. keeps closing and telling me to report an error but closies before i can click on the link to repoet the error!
. good for applying customer payments when they are received and creating invoices on the go at the time services are provided.
awesome ap for a handyman. emailing my client the invoice or receipt is effecient and impressive. being able to enter expenses when they occur saves me office time. only fall back is i cant yet enter store charges.
overall i recommend this app. i have a mobile veterinary service and use this for all of my billing while i'm on the road. it saves me time by allowing me to bill my clients on site at the time of service, and even process the credit card if they choose to pay that way. the only downside is that the cost per month lewis going up.
great so far!. i am really glad we went with quickbooks online, as i love this app! being able to pull up any and all financial information as well as build and email estimates and invoices on the go is crucial to our business! thank you intuit!
🎼love it!!!🎉. we have a construction company, quick books online is a dream come true for us. we can present a client with a proposal at the time of the estimate, get a signature, a deposit, get the job started right away. thank you quick books. 🤓
. great app was worried about using it but it so easy
does not work. app does not work. wish it did, but it does not. none of my vendor activity shows up, profit and loss does not scroll past first page. better no app at all than one that does not work.
. love it!! user friendly and never any issues
latest update crashing on iphone 7. great improvements in the app. extra features are a great bonus. well done. on iphone 7 the app crashes when upon opening banking is selected. i've reproduced 5 times.
. good software, i find it a bit challenging compared to my laptop version.
. love the app
ios 10.01 update...... awful! not user friendly. keeps telling me to update safari to use program. still can't run checks!
worthless. i have never once been able to generate a p&l for a board meeting. the reporting function just does not work, which is the most useful part of accessing this program through a browser. also, even though i can enter a sales receipt, doing deposits from the + does not work and i am unable to make corrections that are relatively simple from the browser. this platform provides no service at all.
very useful app. very useful app, works like a charm
useless. my boss uses qb to track my hours. as far as i can tell, i can't make those changes on this app. that makes this app totally useless to me.
has its benefits.. very nice to write an invoice on the go. but need more invoice templates for the app version. online you can switch templates, need to be the same in the app. effective once you learn the app. not perfect by any means.
ouch. does not have my bank listed. does me no good. been paying for 1 year now. and i see no where how to stop subscribing. cost me over $10.00 a month.
. stress free app
it worked good until it didn't. i can't even login it says app closed
very convenient. i love that i can create an invoice right on the job site. very easy and convenient.
. this was almost my solution to doing invoices on the road. unfortunately, they do not allow pdf attachments when sending an email. i need to send a pdf not jpegs so until this option is added this app is useless for me.
. with the newest update cannot reliably attach receipts! although a long time user, will be unsubscribing soon if not corrected.
great app but missing some key functions. i've used qb online for a year now and its a great service. the app allows me to invoice and record pymts immediately, however i cant seem to enter expenses. if i could do that it would get 5 stars.
. great and easy to invoice all my customers. my customers enjoy using quickbooks because its easy to pay and also accepts mastercard.
"it doesn't synchronize. the app is totally unusable. it doesn't synchronize customers and supplier and the transaction with those missing from the list result as incomplete. tried also to dis install and reinstall: same story. on top of this it must also said that the assistance is unresponsive, many days and repeated enquiries to finally get emails full of irritating smileys and useless answers like ""we are constantly improving the apps to serve our mobile customers""."
high hopes cause big fails. the app crashes all of the time. no integration with desktop versions but ok. i though i would have something on the go for small invoices. i can't get through the first invoice. all progress gets lost with the crashes. i love how much time i save with the desktop version. there customer service has always been terrible. they can't even have a fully working version for the trial period. fail!
adding a photo to a receipt should be simple. apparently there was a recent update that removed the add photo option to tranasactions. it's not there any longer. i called support and they tell me i have to create a note, add the photo to that note, then go find the transaction and add the note to it.
must have!. absolutely vital to my daily business. clients are impressed when i produce an invoice on the spot and process their credit cards before i leave the job site.
. disappointed!!!! what i need is the ability to download and accept new banking transactions, while on the go. having that ability would allow me to spend only a few minutes everyday updating my books, versus having to sit down at a computer to do this. please add this functionality to the android version of qbo. i can do it on the mint app, but not qbo for android : (
app crashing in ios 13. please note that the app is crashes in ios 13. have not been able to open it sine updating. otherwise it is a fantastic application.
. i travel for work and this app is awesome. i can write and email estimates, invoices, and recieve payments on the fly. it makes my life way easier.
great app. this app is great and it supports an even greater cloudbased accounting programme, i wish i had started to use it sooner. it is making my life so much easier.
. good apart from the top of the dashboard on the home page being greyed out.
. great app, should let you see vendors as well
. they said in your invoice that you can cancel anytime and it's not true! it has a glitch and i couldn't cancel it. make me lost two days trying to cancel it and then even charge me the month and did not give back my money. they went from 17 dollars a month to 40 dollars per month! don't never quickbooks
quickbooks online. an intuitive program that works for a number of my smaller clients as well as being cost effective and saving time and bookkeeping fees. works for everyone.
ios 13; don’t do it!. if you need this app to work correctly do not upgrade to ios 13 yet! many bugs... my worst bug: can’t look at any customer info anymore, does not work. yes i uninstalled and reinstalled...
made my job way easier. been really useful for creating invoices and collecting payments for our company!
great app. removed and reinstalled the app on my iphone. works fine
. makes my job so much easier!
quickbooks online review. no longer works on nexus 6p. intuit support unableunwilling to help.
. this app like a zin
pretty good. nice to have my business account online so i can check and send invoices when needed. only annoyance is it keeps fully logging me out.
. good app
no longer works on ipad. this app is no longer functioning as of the most recent update. it used to work on the ipad. the camera feature is difficult to use when trying to take a picture of receipt. it doesn't allow me to record payments any longer. please fix.
awesome app, love quickbooks. use it often to add expenses and check bank data. nice feature of receipt photo, works great
. very easy and useful
great app but needs banking. this app is great since the last major update, but all i want now is to do my banking on it too.
not for the ipad or iphone. the app does not support stp... have to access using web browser on ipad iphone . so don’t buy the app if you want to use it for stp. browser access using an ipad pro , you won’t be able to scroll down or access command icons because they are beyond the margins of the ipad screen. can’t finish inputting categories because the screens won’t scroll at all
crashes with galaxy s7 edge android 6.0.1. i have a new samsung galaxy s7 edge running android 6.0.1. every time i try to log into the app it crashes when signing in and offers to send a report. but the send crash report button results in blue screen. have to force close. very frustrated as i am used to using the app constantly. update: customer support was able to assist with the issue once i emailed them.
underdeveloped & terrible support. the software is totally undeveloped and does not have the features of the regular desktop version. tech support is horrific, they can't help because they don't have the knowledge. intuit had no business releasing the software to the public it's not even ready for beta yet. the iphone app is worthless!
it’s ok, but.... it not very useful as field service software. it’s painfully sloooow to use. even on the pc it’s the same. the software crashes when i need to use it or it’s syncing.
"love this app!. love this app but it would be great if they allow me to include ""shipping date"" for the invoices generated on mobile"
ease of use. being able to utilize the app on mobile has made billing my customers so much easier for my transport company. editing and immediately sending invoices for quick pay is a great option as well. i've been a quickbooks user for 20 years now and will likely not stop anytime soon.
great app. time saver for small business owners
great app!. help you keep track of your business records.
ok... like seriously. i’ve used this app for 2019 mileage and expense tracking. but every week i have to reconnect my bank account. like every single week! why?? i don’t have time to do that. fix this! or i’ll be forced to find a better working service!
. great app
. still learning the ins and outs of the app, but so far i love
not syncing correctly. the sync with their merchant services is not consistent. sometimes invoices are automatically matched and other times they art not. this leads to not easily identifying open or past due invoices with customers which can be challenging.
amazing for small business!!!!!!. i started my service business one year ago and enrolled in quickbooks from day one. i can't rave enough about it! it's made tracking customers, invoices, and expenses so easy i can focus on my work instead of the accounting. still impressed and just in the process of adding payroll.
fantastic!. i love this app. it works really well, and makes it easy for me to stay ontop of invoicing my customers.
help. the android app is very very slow it takes a long time to change a estimate to a invoice i have emailed support several times about the issue with no reply please speed it up.
. complete waste of time app doesn't sync with the online version. the advice given by the help to delete browser history and cache doesn't work either. unreinstalling the app doesn't work.. in the long run you will end up wasting too much time on this program. be warned !! ###edit i've cleared cache, deleted app data it it still doesn't sync.. in particular it's the supplier list and transactions that are all missing
perfect for small businesses too. all the tools needed plus user help forums, makes book keeping and accounting so simple.
bugs. there are alot of bugs in the app. i am about to go back to square. the app keep giving alot of errors.
number monkey. i love pitching the receipt after i enter my expenses!
won't connect to qb online since update.. i've been using qb for ipad with few issues to date, until the latest update. now, i'm on a job, trying to invoice a customer and can not since the app will not connect to qb online.
. what a joke......the sales team are so rude....software is actually pretty good but the attitude of the staff in th sales team have completely put me off using this! i will now be looking elsewhere (fresh books etc).....
ios13. keeps crashing won’t open since update. not helpful!!
. good app very nice and handy
simply functional. app makes invoicing easy, and allows you to track any outstanding receivables. should make tax time much easier.
fantastic app. allencompassing and very user friendly
. very easy to use and keeps everything organized and at my finger tips for billing, payments, expenses and payroll. a must for any business owner!
great!!!. i love this app i love qbo what else is there to say. recent update created tons of issues with ios 9.3.3 some glitches evolved not sure who's fault but hope they get fixed. i appear to get error messages entering my expenses :(. can't save invoice created either please fix. otherwise when the app works it's great one star is its current state.
. nice app
effective app!. truly effective application.
. great app, love that i don't have to write a note to bill someone or change something later. i can do it right after i hang up or deliver an order. still learning all the options. it's not always as straightforward as i'd like, but a couple clicks and i can figure my way around to where i want to go.
. the app works well.
good but needs more functionality. this app works good, but needs more features added. for example, i have to go to a browser and log in there in order to add a deposit manually. i know functionality is being added continuously. so i a hopeful that my review can be a 5 star review in the near future.
moron developers and qa. don’t bother with this app. more time updating this weekly with version changes and bug fixes... jokers
completely useless. i have no idea how this app has a 4.7. you cant even edit transactions within this app. the worst part is that the website is completely broken on an ipad pro. together this makes quick books online completely unusable without a laptop. absolute garbage.
really useless without bank register. the usefulness is really limited without having access to banking features via mobile app. dissappointed.
great product. thanks to my accountant which recommended me to get this. highly recommends to anyone who is more small to medium businesses where we can invoice on the go
slow books. can’t accept transactions in banking section. sluggish app, end up using the computer more often.
zero stars if possible. i login successfully on pc but using same info i get error message saying i don't have an account. if there's no mobile app access, i wish my boss didn't require me to use quickbooks online. the desktop version + go to my pc worked fine.
crash, crash, crash. this app will crash and after every single thing you!
loss of functionality. i had been using this app for a while without any real issues. however, recently the 'expense' button that pulls up from the '+' menu on the home screen is grayed out...thus rendering the app fairly useless on the go! intuit said they unfortunately didn't have the ability to fix issues with the app.
easy to work with. it's just incredible to use and work with.
. app crashes all the time
. if this app doesn't work in india why do showing many ads popup and videos and why did you uploaded on playstore india platform
multiple selection?. hey is it possible to do multiple when using this app on iphone like it’s possible when using my ipad. if not can you make it possible.
still no touch id. i used to think this was a great app, but now with these last 2 updates, i have to constantly uninstall the app and still no touch id. why when something works fine can you not just let it be. please fix back
. please update. can't login
. i keep getting a error that says unable to view payment because it includes finance charges. very frustrating when you can't view invoices.
. i have tried to download app on my ph using play store but after 5 attempts still can't download very frustrating as i need to use this away from home.
"mostly useful. i like having access to my business via my smartphone, however not all features are available (reports) and some calculations don't seem to work properly. after adding payment for clients, the invoices entered afterward are not automatically attached to said payment  even though the overall balance on the account is recalculated. the invoices sit and show as ""unpaid"" even though the account balance is at zero."
doesn't sync open bills or invoices. it doesn't show any of my current or closed bills that have been entered for vendors.
super functional..extremely helpful. quick books app is fantastic! makes using my phone for invoicing and estimates very easy! recommend to anyone..... no glitches, no hang ups..... you won't be disappointed!
. zero stars if i could. app never tracks my milage and is constantly failing. waste of money.
very useful. i run a small business with this software. i haven't found anything better yet!
opening an acct. loved the look of this app, unfortunately i could not open an acct as it would not accept or recognise my telephone number, either mobile or home, so not a good start. dumb app.
app login. i can not login to app using my online login details. have reset again and again and nothing works. very frustrating
good to review. i haven't got deep into it to create billing invoices yet but just to review what i've done from the work station, it's great.
love it. they fixed the errors i was having. great app now.
kiss. keep it simple stupid as they say, this app is brilliant, simple, easy to use a great for a small business that just wants everything in one app at their fingertips. well done team.
wah. good app!
pretty useless. can't mark an expense as billable therefore can't create invoices by automatically including up billed expenses can't record deposits can't view downloaded trans action useless
great app for every business. i have only played with this app a little to see what it can do, it is a great app for any service business, it automaticly updates all the records when you make a sell or a purchase. perfect if you are bad about keeping up with paperwork, this app will help u do it all as you go.
great app. thanks
. great app
great for on the go businesses. i have been using quickbooks mobile for about a year now and it makes keeping up with invoices and payments a breeze.
"don't download latest version!!. software was great before the latest update. now, no more touchid support, no ability to email invoices. we all remember what apple did with the maps mess, i wonder if intuit will have the testicular fortitude to ""can"" the person who attempted to update the already good software?"
. nearly worthless... it isn't userfriendly, most times doesn't work, and can't easily search for items.
not an intuitive product. i'm very disappointed with this product. i've used quickbooks on my laptop for two years as well as the gopayment app. this has been extremely frustrating to setup and use for both my accountant and myself.
making life easy. qbs has enabled me as an absolute novice to business manage the financials of all components of my business. the ability for my accountant to look in and assist were necessary and conduct tax admin such as bas preparation has been such a relief. making life easy in small business is a welcome capability.
. gd apps
easy iphone app. i like it, it’s easy enough to navigate on my iphone. you cannot do everything that you can do on the computer but it takes care of most business.
estimates on the go. ehh
why bother?. don't understand why they bothered developing this app? much more functionality available using safari and logging into quickbooks!
does most. app does most of things i need for my business. one thing i am requesting for is the ability to pay with a daily rate not just hourly. i have a home care agency and this is how we pay our employees in some cases. lynn
great app on the go. there isn't any comparison to the quality and convenience of the quickbooks package
keeps crashing. every time i try to upload a receipt from my phone, it crashes when i press save & doesn’t save at all. i’ve tried closing the app & trying again, but it does it every time, so basically i can’t take a picture of any receipt & upload it. please fix! update: i still can’t upload a receipt unless i take a picture of it elsewhere & upload vs taking a picture of it on the app.
simple.. i'm a 30 yr old first time entrepreneur and small business owner. i wish i had paid a little bit more attention in that intro to accounting course in undergrad. but the beauty of qb is someone like me can get up to speed pretty quickly. what i love about intuit's products is they simplify your life, and qb makes keeping accurate and precise books very gratifying.
love it!. so far the app is easy to navigate and i like using it.
update is terrible. since the update, navigation of the app is clunky at best. you can no longer match transactions, or do anything with your banking accounts except to see the balances. no transactions will work. this update has way to many flaws. be cautious to download.
review. happy with qb is working for me just need to work out how to link my bank in and do my accounts on it this should be simple but l am no wizard on tec. the code that l am ask for from my bank is not linking and not sure why. but so fare it's good.
works well. good app
. great app
. wonderful app! extremely helpful when needing to createsend an invoice on the fly
. app is not working after the recent update, i am not able to login. it's simply goes blank after tapping the qb icon
convenient & helpful. as a new business owner and usually overwhelmed with just running the business, the app and website make the financial and tax side of the business easy to stay current and accurate. once i got the initial tax required and payroll payments set up, it's made my life easier.
owner. great app nothing more to be said. everything is so organized. i love it!!
very good app. good
electrician. most important tool of my business.
great app. has helped my business be very successful.
excellent interface and convenient app. this app is a life saver and helps me run my small business affairs smoothly. i can submit my invoices and estimates on the go with ease. definitely a must app to have.
fix finally now i can get back to work.. this version fixed the errors from the last update. glad it working again. quickbooks has been good except the last update. this one fixed the issue. we us this app for our onsite business and it's great. several times i would send an invoice to the customer when i'm leaving their home and before i get to the next job it's already paid. update. does not work again. :(
need to be able to add bills and accept transactions’s that should match to bills. i think the title says it all. qbo is amazing such a great product but the app needs more functionality. mainly the bills, i need to add a bill from my phone and then be able to match multiple bills as one payment to relevant bills on payment. so frustrating having to find a computer to do this.
great app!. this app saves me so much time! it lets me run my business much more efficiently! wouldn't be quite as successful without it. it also has very professional invoices and estimates
so far so good!. this app has come in very handy!
#1 business app. after trying many programs, including all of quickbooks packages, quickbooks has the best tools for running your startup.
no complaints. does the job.
. i would like to tell everyone who reads this that my small company and i were victims of a fraud through this app and they did nothing to help me and at this moment they put my company in collection !! in addition this is not a good app!!!!!! 🤬🤬🤬🤬
. i downloaded this app and not once has it worked. it crashes when i'm trying to login. i've never made it past the login screen!
glitchy, incomplete features, and poor data. this app needs serious attention. after years of putting up with this hot mess i’m fed up and rarely use it any more. no matter what i do i can’t get data to load that is any more recent than 2016 for most vendors. no one from tech support replies  ever. american express transactions can’t be synched or approved in the app. about the only thing it’s useful for is matching typical transactions in our checking account.
worse and worse with every update.. the more recent the update, the worse this app runs. worked great until they changed to a new platform and now it's slower then ever. to logging in or saving pictures out in the field, it takes an additional 20 mins on the job site just waiting for quickbooks.
could be better. still no auto save. it’s 2018 folks, time to wake up. does not perform the same on my phonetablet as my desktop. i.e automated emails on my desktop autofill my clients name, my phone does not. on my desktop i can switch the order of items on my invoices and estimates, on my phone i cannot. the simple editing features are extremely important on a device that smaller than my hand.
new version. the updates are great.
. great app. so convenient from my phone
absolute magic. this app is brilliant it has made my account keeping so much easter and better, i'm not loosing bits of paper everywhere and find it much simpler to keep on top of everything (i think me using this has made my accountant much happier too as it has reduced his work load)
update ruined a great small business tool. quickbooks use to be an awesome tool to let us send invoices after a job is completed on the spot. it also allowed a user to edit payment information anywhere via the mobile app. this is now all gone thanks to the new update. if it is not fixed soon, we are looking into transferring our accounts to another system.
great ap. great easy to use app really close to getting rid of my laptop entirely
great app. i actually love this thing. it's pretty easy to use once you come to understand some of the functions. daunting at first but learning curve isn't too steep. helped me make sense of my numbers.
doesn’t have my bank. doesn’t have major banks in my country so can’t use it.
needs some work. this app is good but needs more work. error message kept popping up while working in it. some tasks are missing like entering bills. can't find sign out button or switch to a different company.
love quickbooks. we started and successfully operate a small business. quickbooks has been fantastic for us. we can see the cash flow as well as invoice, manage vendors and taxes. it has been a complete package for us and provides a professional appearance to our customers.
qb app fail. app is very frustrating. sometimes works great but most of time wants to download company data and 15 min later still not downloaded. i try over and over and give up. then every once in awhile it works. fix or get rid of.
. love it. need to add ability to add bills via mobile app.
. an absolute must for small business.. and seek advice from tech support before assuming. functionality isn't there. ive had no problems... gives me confidence in my books
crashes with galaxy s7 edge android 6.0.1. i have a new samsung galaxy s7 edge running android 6.0.1. every time i try to log into the app it crashes when signing in and offers to send a report. but the send crash report button results in blue screen. have to force close. very frustrated as i am used to using the app constantly. update: customer support was able to assist with the issue once i emailed them.
. working hard to get this goning
. love this app
best ap and program for home business. i trailed several other programs before quickbooks. it allows me to split an expense between personal and business which others wouldn't. the ap is easy to use and love that i can take a photo of the receipt. no more loosing receiptshaving them fade etc.
new update issues. the previous update solved these issues, but this current update causes error messages with sales rep login whenever creating invoices, and also causes printing communication errors constantly.
new update horrible. it's always been glitch but since the new update i can't add products to the estimate and customer service is clue less in how to resolve the issue.
. like the app just struggling to get the logo in the est and inv struggle on the mobile
"issues. it was working fine on my ipad up until last week. then starting bugging. not all customer transaction appear on the mobile app. called customer service about it. they told me that they were ""working on it"". we shall see. i pay for it monthly...i asked if i still had to pay this month even though it's not working as advertised...answer was yes. not happy with that answer. i will keep you posted. bob"
. great app i recommend to anyone and every one. thanks
disappointing absences. so disappointing that i cannot see qty on hand on the app. also, limited reporting on app!
best mobile accounting app. great improvements in the latest version. easily the best ipadiphone app for accounting, that sits well alongside the full featured qbo software.
. like everyone else i'm having major issue with the app. since recent update i can only see recent activity. everything else is blank.
this app does not function properly on ios13. i cannot view any customer files. i can search for them, but the app will not let me click on a customer to edit invoices.
conevenient but lacks features. overall, good for checking basic things on the go, as well as some other basic functions. it is far from fully featured though. quickbooks online sees constant updates with new features lately, so it’s probably just a matter of time before the app catches up a bit.
great but........ i love the app but it could use a bit more integration. for instance, you can airprint an invoice but you can't airprint a paid invoice. seems like an oversight.
love it. easy to use. great support team.
great way to keep up with small business book keeping. in previous years, with my software based quickbooks, i ended up doing most of my neglected books once a year for tax times. with this i do an update on a daily bases and will have do just a little detailing come years end.
garbage update. please test all your updates before releasing them to paying clients!!! invoicing issues, client search issues, expense issues, wth!!!
. does what i need but could add a few things i love this app. i use it in my barbershop and i like the fact everything is all there whether it is on my tablet, phone or computer. the only other thing i would like to see incorporated into it is the ability to generate paystubs and do payroll then email to employees. but we can't have everything we want. aside from that, fantastic program. keep up the good work.
. this is a great app has saved me lots of time when doing paperwork. easy to manage and work
. this app works amazing for my cleaning business! couldnt live without it, and it saves me a lot of money instead of paying an accountant
. easier to send invoices via the app than it is on the computer. only flaw is i can't enter a negative number for discounts but that could just be my phone and not the app. overall i highly recommend it for anyone.
fix finally now i can get back to work.. this version fixed the errors from the last update. glad it working again. quickbooks has been good except the last update. this one fixed the issue. we us this app for our onsite business and it's great. several times i would send an invoice to the customer when i'm leaving their home and before i get to the next job it's already paid.
latest update is garbage. update: 1620 still a garbage app even after multiple emails back and forth with quickbooks development team and now it’s been weeks since i heard from them the app still don’t work even after new updates app has been great up until 3 weeks ago now it no longer works! crashes every time i try to open the app.
. good app
helpful. it's a very convenient app, i use it all the time and it's been the best!
the app needs work. the web based service is great, but the app needs work. the tool i need (journal entries) are not available through this app, so it's not very useful.
. now, can't even access some of my clients from the app. i have sent the error logs several times to intuit, but no response. it keeps getting worse. lacking the fingerprint option to login. also, accepting transactions from bank feed in android not as smooth as it is in iphone. app starts freezing after accepting a few transactions. additionally, progressive invoicing does not work in the app. should make it more useful for accountants though, adding bank reconciliations capability would help.
working great, love dashboard. app is easy to use on the go. some things are better done on desktop but for the most part can do a invoice from phone and accept payments. would be nice if inventory feature wasn't additional cost
a complete joke.. the quickbooks ipad app is pointless. the it team who did it either ripped you off, or, you asked for something ridiculously cheap and the it team delivered exactly what you paid for.
"buggy, rough, glitchy. frequently disconnectswon't sync to my companies data. frequently ""has trouble emailing this form"" when i try to send clients invoices. frequently is unable to save invoices. using 4g lte network and wifi with same results. says i'm offline when connected to wifi and network. only way to solve problems is seemingly to uninstall and reinstall app. update: now app frequently won't create pdf's that i can then print out. absolutely horrible for mobile business convenience."
no longer loads. after upgrading quickbooks online, this app no longer loads on ipad or iphone. please fix.
. app takes a while to open. tends to freeze once i'm using it. very frustrating
. terrible app. really let's you down. i've toyed to log in numerous times only to be told my session has expired.
terrible experience with customer support. we had terrible experience with customer support. for a very important issue we contact qb customer support team, we wait for 6 days an never respond our request. for this incident we can't bill our invoices. we hate our experience. consider customer support if your company needs help.
. good app.
app not working since update. normally i'd give the app 45 stars but every time i log in now it says sign in successful but there is no online account associated with the email and to start a free trial. however when i login from safari, i get in no problem. please fix as i am unable to access data from my phone.
. not at all professional, still there is lots of bugs and team behind is not able to resolve the issues we are reporting
quickbooks scheduler. we love quickbooks and how well it works in the field. we got the gopayment as well. the only thing i wish quickbooks would add is a scheduler for jobs open, accepted, and estimates pending.
great app!. i love the flexibility of having my company info at all times.
useless. why even bother with this app? i can enter a bill from a sub or supplier on the website or the mac app but can only enter paid expenses here? i can do everything i need to do with my business on my iphone without carrying an ipad or macbook air except use the quickbooks app to enter or actually pay bills (only able to record bills already entered as paid). please fix this (or just tell us you’re not fixing it) !!!
. best app to have to keep updated!!!!
new update. i love the app and it has been great for us for years. however, the new update does not allow a custom date range for reports and when you edit an invoice it gives you a small screen that not everything fits on. please bring back the custom date range and make is so we can see everything on edits.
pretty good. pretty good app. could use a little improvement. doesnt have all the functions of the regular version.
missing functions. great app for its current functions but it is missing functions such as entering bills while on the road. most of my purchases are on accounts so it leaves me doing my book work at home like the old systems. if this gets added i will stay a happy user if not back to one of the other competitors.
absolutely fantastic!. this app is incredible. having been using for 6 months, and it has revolutionised the way we are able to do business. so easy to setup, use and understand. i highly recommend to anyone that needs an easy orderinvoicesales system for their business.
i love the ease of doing business on the go.. app is fast, user friendly, and i can do all of my business while traveling.
. mobile app runs faster than desktop app. easy to use.
makes handling my business easier.. enjoy the invoice and payment features and reports, plus the app. makes my life much easier.
why must the change the fonts. good software but the recent ui change is terrible. the colors are downgraded and the fonts look horrible...makes the product look cheap
. lousy compared to the ios app. bank does not sync and invoices that are over due don't show up
works well. this app is far better than the desk top program for mac. as a small business i have many more things i need to do than spending time learning a program. it allows easy access for my accountant and mobility for me!
shady. very easily hacked and an unsafe server. average waiting time for customer service on the phone is hour. you will be transferred at least 2 to 3 times, hopefully you can get somebody who speaks english.
works and convenient. easy way to enter sales and expenses. i've had no problems with this app.
app crashes constantly. i used to love this app. the last couple of months the app crashes daily and multiple times. i’m in the middle of working and the app says critical updates are needed and logs me out. i’m extremely frustrated with this considering i pay over $20month to use this software across all my devices.
. i have been using this app for 6 months. $40 subscription doesn't get me receipt capture, but the $10 subscription gets it... cannot get it to save information once i enter it, tells me to call a support line that seemingly cannot help me.
horrible. this app and their customer service is terrible.
good app!. i like the app. it let's me run quick books from my phone (gs5) in the field and it runs smoothly. doing estimates on site is great.
this product is fantastic!. i will be recommending this to all of my customers. it's simple, easy to use & fast to set up. in fact it may feel like you've missed something it's that simple! intuit have put together a great product for the australian market.
. makes billing simple on the road
. easy accounting! using this to help me get my small business started. the service is a little on the pricey side but having this app is fantastic!
works great!. it's simple to use, great for small business owners. really helps you stay on top of your business.
clumsy, error prone, price has doubled.. not a completely trash service, but it hasn’t gotten any better despite company promises. price has doubled since i initially joined. ipad app bugged, today i tried to enter an invoice payment, no joy. tried to leave service last year and the year before. exporting info was a nightmare, and impossible on mac, effectively leaving me held hostage. cancelling service at end of year as i’d rather try a different online accounting or simply go with a desktop version.
shari. love it
just crashes. has never worked period. galaxy note 4
a good start. i have 19 overdue invoices and quickbooks sent me 19 alerts about it, telling me i have 19 overdue invoices, all at the same time. how about sending 1 alert only?
cant update billing info in app. slow, awkward layout, intelligent prefill of categories usually incorrect slowing down workflow. will be using moyob to set up accounts for my next fy.
. service sucks.
really helpful!!. i am a computer engineer and being able to make estimates and invoices in the field has really helped me!
easy. i can't believe how easy this app is to use!
extremely limited. no credit memos, you can't have a simple addition of how much you have to receive in open invoices at a specific date, no journal entries. i have only my ipad pro and if i try to access the web version, it's not compatible with any browser on ios. so you're stuck and you need a pcmac only for these things. it's a terrible, terrible experience.
crashes. upgraded to ios 10, now app will no open.
". mobile app is full of bugs, recent ""update"" has now made it so my account is unable to sync and wont let me log in. not very useful for my mobile business. tried reinstalling the app, still no luck. *tried clearing data, same issue."
first class. really a great app makes life easier
"enjoying quickbooks online. easy to use interface and they are frequently updating features. my only complaint is that sometimes when searching for sent invoices it won't recognize, for example 74, when it's ""invoice 2015074"""
awesome!. fantastic app. as a freelancer i am often away from my office. being able to create estimates and have my clients sign them on the spot has been great. and being able to send invoices from anywhere has absolutely changed my life! love it.
. very good online accounting software .please update with reports for android version.
lifesaver. i used to spend hours every week making my own invoices with spreadsheets, now with quickbooks, i can get all my accounting stuff done in minutes. it's the best decision i've made all year!
. this app is slow
refund made impossible. i’ve been making payment on this stupid app not using it at all. there’s no easy way to refund or unsubscribe this stupid app. who do i bring the attention to since quickbook site says they have nothing to do with the billing and subscription?
great but has a long way to go. was so excited to migrate to qbo but now that i'm here, there are so much important elements that are not here  bills payment stub or remittance advise doesnt even have a reference or a check #.
. this has made it so much easier to keep track of our business expenses. i have recommended qbo to all my friends who own there own business.
awesome app. feature rich and also user friendly
so useful. i have just upgraded from quickbooks 2006 to online. can't get over how much more useable it is. i can check my accounts whenever and wherever i am. it's actually quite fun to use!
. quickbooks is rubbish, i have literally wasted days of my life trying to set it up to work efficiently only to hit endless glitches. the last straw was that it lost information vital to my business and therefore money because of lack of clarity on the app. beware 'edit current' actually means actually means change template and loose all previous information. quickbooks don't care about the individual and have not compensated for this.
simplicity for a complicated world. thank you, quickbooks! this is seriously a life saver app! super simple and convenient!
. lacks customization features
. love this app for my business!
. something has changed. lately i've been having a lot of glitches. everytime i try so save an invoice, it doesn't go back to the preview. therefore i wind up pushing the save button more than once which duplicate the invoice.
. so far good. have a lot to learn a but seems to be what i am looking for when starting a new opportunity.
contractor. works great for all aspects of my business. only issue is updating my accounts linked to it. just keeps sending details to my bank and never stops. i have to reset every time to update. other then that it's great
administrator. nice application.
easypeasy. this was the first software that made perfect sense for my social media management and marketing company! i'm unclear why there are so many complaints. i have had no problems or unrealistic acceptance.
. great for my needs to do estimates and invoices in the field.
chris. love it!! great setup! easy. just love it!!
. my wife has this app and it works well for her business. i got this app based on her recommendation but unfortunately it has been full of technical difficulties. several hours wasted on talking to tech support and was told the tech team might resolve issues in a week. all details of my invoices are erased and wrong dates are shown on all invoices amongst other problems. wish they could solve this faster, has been very stressful experience so far for me.
fantastic for when you’re on the move. this app has really helped me operate more efficiently from a mobile office. the ability to quickly and easily produce quotes and invoices from my ipad has been extremely useful. the app isn’t as fully featured as its desktop counterpart but it does enough to suit my needs, whilst i’m on the move. i’m running this app on a 10.5 ipad pro and it has been flawless.
. great app for on the go invoices
. easy to use. great app
great compared to alternatives. could use more options available though the website (like inventory management, receiving payments to elsewhere than undeposited funds etc)
. love the program
"update broke the app. since the update i have to type my password each time i open it after it has been closed for a while. this doesn't work in front of customers. (yes, i enabled touchid. the problem seem to be hitting others and is based on now intuit decided to ""fix"" touchid by breaking it in this version)"
. cool app!
response to the quickbooks online account app. i love quickbooks accountant online program; but i noticed that there are limits to the quickbooks accountant online app capabilities compared to what the downloadable online quickbooks accountant software program could do. otherwise, really happy with online quickbooks accountant program!!
needs time keeping entry. quickbooks really needs to come up with an app to do their time entry for quickbooks online
setup. could not setup company profile, kept getting error message. on to the next one.
great functionality across platforms. i use qbo to do estimates and invoicing on a laptop, ipad and iphone. i occasionally swipe a credit card too and they all perform very well. little bit presentation on each device but they all work!
. works better than the pc version, easy to track expenses etc
suscripción suspendida! ya pague! pero sigue suspendida ayuda. ayuda ! esta suspendida y no puedo facturar
. dont bother if you dont have access to pc or laptop.basic features like editing customer email is not available on mobile devices including tablets.if an invoice isnt sent because the recipient email address sends it back,you have no way of knowing that an error has occurred even when attempting to check via any web browser.caused me £1000's of cashflow headache. contacted customer support,got a nonsensical response.made it sound like the problem is an actual feature of the app and software.
very helpful. wonderful app for on the go needs.
quits randomly. when i am on my tablet the program will just randomly quit working and no of my work will be saved. it has been doing this for a few months
nice app but i’d like to access the inventory. when you are out and making an invoice it is very important to be able to check the inventory
vital for biz. makes it simple to analyze business from your phone.
. not good at updating itself
love it. this app helps me keep my business organized on the go
owner. there are a few problems that i find and maybe it me. the more i use it the more i like it
error add item. ne fonctionne pas, toujours un message d'erreur quand je veux entrer un item ou une description. impossible de faire une facture avec mon mobile !
quickbooks online. the application what ever so far developed is 55. (smooth, easy to use, great ui design). but there are many existing features missing between web and app. an by quickbooks online itself can have lot more basic features which is available in many other pos softwares to manage a firm. your updates are very minimal or nothing. developments are slow!! support team is reactions fast for the queries (just reacting) but no solution for problems or no concrete answers for new feature request.
the best invention since the wheel. i am extremely happy with quickbooks. i’ve owned restaurants for over 20 years, and i started using quickbooks about three years ago. what a nightmare it used to be doing paperwork. i could not live without quickbooks now to provide for me and my family and employees. the best investment i ever made.
. started a new business, had to find a way to manage my capital going in and out, also was able to send invoices directly to my customers, do quotes and look at profits. just a great app! perfect for me
great app. a lot of functionality from the site packed into the app. easy to use.
so far so good.... it is working as advertised. would like to have a bit more color and design to the invoices. not complaining, just suggesting.
perfect. great app and works terrifically. thanks.
. worst customer support ever i write email to contact for support they say it's for global support then again i write email to india support they send me to us supposed.sad no response from the company first they sell at 4500 then next week its 500
super simple. i love this app! so easy to take pictures and attach receipts to my transactions, send invoices, take payments, sign docs... very easy and simple...love it!
mr. recent updates have slowed both the phone and computer app to a crawl. very frustrating. otherwise a very good app on my phone.
. a really good platform for small business. the program is user friendly and has a great online help community and customer service.
a j rooter. it's an easy program to use makes life a lot less aggravating when you can do your work on the road
few useful features for me. most of the main features i need aren’t in the app. lots of features i never use are in the app. no bill payment, no upcoming bills showing up in checking register like it does on mine. no credit memos.
great product. excellent product great interface between apple and microsoft . stream line business as efficiency.
. i like most everything about it except for not being able to save my invoices where and with what name i want
". latest update to my pixel made the app very laggy, and the ""feedback"" popup appeared again after i submitted it the first time! however, rebooting the app seemed to fix."
this app is great for on the go but still needs a few things to be fixed like when i mail the invoices or estimates to my customers they always have trouble recieving them..
ruined. worked great until the latest update. now includes all inactive customers so it makes it impossible to find an active customer.
. you're using it under a free trail and once it's up you nolonger have access to the app
great. it will make things easier, just wish i had a place to put in mileage
handy. great app! can create estimates and get signatures right on my phone!
time saver, makes everything simple. thus app saves time and allows for doing simple tasks on the go making my church more accurate and efficient
accept button. accept button in banking is not working after update
terrible customer service and often outages. terrible customer service and often outages. if you have a problem you're on your own because there are no numbers to call or anybody to message. it's only faqs
. i like the app works very well in the field. can slide cards input data all from the work site.
awesome app... its amazing app and each update is awesome. but it's not as near the desktop in terms of functionality. overall, if you use quickbooks then its a must have..
ability to get paid, in my pocket. if all the quickbooks app allowed me to do was create and send invoices on the fly, i would pay for it. it is that and a lot more.
. simple to navigate
owner. love the app. makes running my business so easy. i would give it five stars except once i was using the app and the system was down for little while. made me feel a little uneasy
the app used to work?. why do companies change apps from functional to crash is beyond me?
qbo quickstart. i find it user friendly, reasonably easy to pick up and the ability to use it on my phone, ipad or pc is very useful.
amazing app. amazing app it's really easy to use.
owner. love the program i am having problems inputing my desktop customers and previous business information. called the help desk and still waiting forba fix
. very useful in conjunction with app on pc.
. grid great app need estimates though n e one know how to do that other than that great app very easy
cody. no reports. no p&l. can not work with downloaded transactions, which for me is critical. looks good, but is not really useful if your trying to get work done. maybe it will get better!
". terrible customer service, took my money for a monthly subscription, then did not activate my subscription and now after 3 days of 10 pm3 am ""customer service"" messages, resulting in absolutely nothing, richie more or less told me i'm screwed and intuit, inc is keeping my money and that i can try to get a refund from google for my intuit subscription. poor business. if anyone wants to actually see what richie says, message me and i'll forward conversations."
great small business tool. excellent on a laptop, doesn't handle banks with authentication dongles very well, mobile app doesn't handle them at all. can't do payroll from mobile. receipt tracking is easy and works well. reports and snap shots handy.
. i've been using quickbooks for a few years. it's been great. but lately i haven't been able to access old invoices or quotes. very inconvenient for past work that we've done. now i'm having a huge issue with latest data not syncing to my device and can't even get into my account. things should be getting better not worse. i've consulted with customer service which hasn't helped either.
. used to be an ok app, but it hasn't worked at all in several months. every time i open it there's some kind of problem and i should try again later. worthless.
app crashes in ios 13 & 13.1 .. app crashes in ios 13 & 13.1 . customer service had no clue
love it. so easy and confident love this app great for my freelance makeup business
great app. keeps my business organized
bs. imported a csv for earlier history than the standard import, as the instructions said to, only to find nothing in the record anywhere, again. yes, i spent a few hours, imported lots of transactions, got nothing, twice. screw these people.
makes life easier!. helps me keep record of everything from invoices, payments customers and expenses. all from my phone
. quickbooks online helps my company operate from my truck & my house it is very easy to use & once you get the hang of it organizing my business for my accountant it helps in ways i can't explain
. easy to use, great for keeping track of expenses, account payable, billing invoices, service. link to your bank account to keep track of everything all in one place
intuit keeps working it but stumbles on occasion. i've been a qbo user for over 4 years now and run my whole oneman business on it. each app version is a bit better than the last and they do fix bugs when notified. i continue to be happy to see intuit continue to improve the app and the web interface. the blanking of bank account data in the dashboard appears to be fixed in v5.3.
very satisfied!. been using the mobile app for the past 3 months now, and i can say it does everything i need. very easy to issue invoices, receive the money, match, reconcile the bank. the support people are very helpful and have a lot of patience!
. i've used qb for 8 years. this app is the better and more seamless than the pc version. love the capability to invoice customers on the job, record payments and send a receipt in seconds.
. so far...i began adding my customers, payments, sales receipts etc, and it's working out well! pretty simple so far!
. no expenses apple app has expenses. android does not. somebody please explain me logic of it. android ppl only care to make money? we spend nothing! yey
great app. i using this app for my business is so easy the handle it thank you guys for this great app
waiting for updates. quite frankly, it's been totally useless. the app does not sync new data entries with the online database. i've already spent well over three hours with multiple customer support reps. the idea of creating invoices is great....only problem....it does not work!!!
tons of bugs and glitches. there are lots of glitches and lack of features in this app. the vendor transaction history is spotty, many vendors and missing history all together. profit and loss report doesn’t scroll. can’t see the true checkbook register of checks that are written out but haven’t yet cleared. it’s really not very good.
easy to use. i found it very convenient to use from anywhere i m
"not as easy as you might expect. certain things you think you should be able to do like delete a transaction are unnecessarily complicated. also, i feel like there should be ""help"" without emailing someone... maybe there is, maybe i haven't found it yet, but i think the program could use work."
. the self employed app was better at tracking milage this one doesn't even track milage anymore this crashes when i try to add manually it won't let me set the endpoint. won't log me in on fingerprint sometimes, hangs and crashes a lot. overall its no where near as stable as the self employed version.
. user friendly... excellent app..
well made basic accounting. quickbooks online has been extremely useful. i have a small contracting business, and i can record an expense in seconds, photo the receipt, create an invoice or estimate, and email these to customers. syncs instantly and automatically across multiple devices, so it's on my phone, tablet and online. the cost is tiny, and it takes care of itself  no more shoebox!
great app. it seems to work well! i would suggest it, you can easily go from a laptop to ipad to iphone...
great. it's a lot easier to use that the 10.0 version i had installed. love that i can invoice customers right thru email and get paid within 2 days!! linking bank accounts is is a huge plus too! ! i'm honestly excited about tax season this year!
good app. does pretty much what you want
great & uptodate!. this is a great little app to give you access into the back end of your quickbooks online account. great for doing simple invoicing and adding expenses. i still use the desktop browser for more complicated reports and such. well done and intuit keeps the app up to date thank you!
awsome. easy to use just take the time to set it up best software for small business
. great software. so easy to use and very reliable.
2 stars. lack feature for canadian user. improved since update. no longer have connectivity problem over 4g. current problem with receiving online payment as i am a canadian user. paid same rate as american user with less but crucial feature. your thoughts developer?
very good app. app is ok,but expense entry is still missing on mobile app. from the last update am not able to create invoice or add any items in this app.
". checked this app out to see if it was good for my business. i was charged 7.99 for a ""free"" 30 day trial. decided it wasnt the right app for me. thanks for the 2 days i used it and was charged for. awesome!! (insert sarcasim here)"
. limited bank support. no good for personal finance. not many german banks supported.
no backup. i no longer needed the software so cancelled. but, once they stop collecting your money, they destroy your financial records. this then makes it impossible to do your taxes! unless you have a backup or regularly download the records, it will screw you over. i contacted them and they basically said, you lose! canadian law requires them to maintain your records for seven years!
small business asset. easy way to keep track off all those expenses, invoices, payments etc for a small business owner with little time to spend on administrative stuff.
. tells me to update the app i go to up data and at boots's be back i can't even use it right now
. awesome app
great app!. super convenient to track all my business transactions on the go. recent updates have made it much easier and more features are accessible.
. takes a while to get used to it. handy app
owner of vanoverconstruction llc. making my life a lot easier thank you
great app. accounting on the go!. ahh my favorite part of the day just got a whole lot easier. this app lets you track you individual transactions on the fly. it also lets you categorize and itemize expenses. if you like neat books and your on your phone a lot this app makes things easy. it's free so just try it out.
very confusing interface. i'm using this because of convenience, not usability. customizing your forms is excruciating at best. auto fill functions don't work sometimes. good luck finding your saved form when you want to finish and send it. and why can't i load data from a po to a vendor and an invoice to a customer? i could go on, but won't. but seriously, the form design features are just ridiculously cumbersome and make me want to toss my laptop out the window. carry on.
. dissatisfied. was able to get on to thw app because it kept saying there was an error. i was to finish the processes of registering online but just want to try out beforw purchasing it. it would allow me too. uninstall.....
needs expenses  time functionality.. obvious missing functionality.
no longer works with ios 13. i just updated to ios 13. the app now crashes immediately after it tries to launch my company. i tried reinstalling it but no luck. please fix this asap!
wonderful app!!!. couldn't sing the praises high enough. i run a small, single member managed llc and the quickbooks online app is everything i need. i can create and send invoices and sales receipts on the go, even have the customer sign right on my iphone or ipad.
horrible horrible app. this new version is terrible! it will not save invoices for payments when i apply them, but then when i log in to the desktop version there's duplicate and triplicate payments.
rcborkert. so far this is a good program. a bit pricey. maybe they will make a better deal at the end of the term (year)
new update make it worse. take a lot to load and open, still missing two things, send invoices by text message and option to choice your start screen menu
bug fixed. your problem with app
india is not mentioned. sorry to say that but i uninstalled the app in 3mins because india as a nation is not mentioned.
the android app is so diffrent than the ios app.. ios app has the functionality to select multiple items too an estimateorder with the multi select feature. this is missing in android. also before the update, the send comand asked the way we wanted to send the invoice and we can select email, fax application. but with the update it only send with the quickbooks email. cant send by fax anymore. please provide the share option on invoice and estimates atleast.
. not bad unable to upload historical data really hurts this app.
". getting this message for the last 3 days on my android. ""there was a problem syncing your data. wait a few minutes and try again"". please fix this edit: i have done all those steps, cleared cache, uninstalled, reinstalled, gave all permissions, even did a full factory reset on the phone and still same issue.."
invoices and estimates design. the design and layout of the invoices and estimates templates are outdated. seems like a small thing, but it reflects poorly on a business’ brand, and it is so easily fixed on your end. hire a professional designer and give clients a template that says quickbooks cares about our brand too.
just awful!!!. is this seriously how you're going to roll out your app by pissing off customers. can't even sign in half the time due to 'connection errors'. your company is an ultra fail.
. typical of qbo: half baked with features always being removed so they can charge you more money for them in another tier.. leaving mostly buggy features you wont use! can't even enter time tracking?! uninstalling!!!
two factor log in broken. can't log in since the app was updated, it just crashes after i enter my login details
. nothing more appropriate and useful for us at this time. qb is invaluable. keep it up folks
. accounting standard for small businesses
. so far not happy. it doesn't show my address nor phone number on quotations and i can't find a way to make it do so. also states 30 day free, then gives me a measly 24 hrs from the time of install to save with a monthly discount. ok, i'll bite. they immediately sucked my first monthly payment. where's this 30 day free trial? biggest thing is its extremely limited and not ready for prime time. poor release.
superb. smart accounting app
user. good app but needs more features
. so much more efficient as a web based app!
excellent!. this is a fab piece of software for both selfemployed and accountants to sync all your activity in one place.
great app!. only complaint is i wish i could create a invoice and with the total job and then invoice for a smaller amount keeping the job total on the same invoice if that makes sense. no other complaints. overall i would recommend to anyone!
. i have contacted customer service several times for support issues with the appquickbooks online not syncing the transactions automatically. no one seems to have an answer on what's going on. each time i'm advised by a customer service represenative to remove and reconnect the bank account yet in doing so it still doesn't work.
. great for a small business!! does everything i need. except milage...
sign in error. can't even sign in anymore. tried on multiple devices so i know it's not my phone. please fix
so easy to send an invoice on the go.. so easy to add items, rates and invoice2go, email it while you are waiting for your coffee and your up to date !
. improving with each update!
pretty good. limited invoice customisation is annoying but otherwise pretty good. app works great.
. cant connect to the app
. we use this to track our business expenses and are so pleased with the functionality of it! it just gets better with each update.
i love quickbooks online. i love quickbooks online & my accountant does also. this app is really good for doing your expenses on but as far as invoicing i still do it on the computer. it's very handy for a small business. the fact you can enter an expense, take a picture of the receipt & go on your merry way. i'm sold.
great app. easy accounting program to implement and run with. great to have access across all my devices.
confining.. pretty okay accounting software if you don't mind quickbooks owning you.
amazing. is a great app, i love doing all our book work from my phone. anywhere anytime. only down full is i can't do the pay run on the app or phone internet. i need a laptop or computer to do it. other than that, great!
. this app keeps getting error loading items, to invoice and estimates can't use it. i call them for support and they have no support they referred me to log in on the web site and the same happens the search button flashes and dispensers. don't waste your time and money. if any one know about a good and reliable app let me know. this one is not reliable nor is their support.
easy. i don't like accounting whatsoever however quickbooks online is so easy to use and does so much more than keeping the books up to date.
2016 update is a headache. much improved after initial deterioration in poor updates. great software now. real time accounting is brilliant. l
. good overall very happy with this app. my only complaint is that my products are not listed by category like they are on the web based version so it makes it difficult to find items when creating invoices or estimates. the mobile site has this feature (but no option to create estimates), so hopefully the app could have it too?
. baixeii e testei na esperança que tivesse as mesmas funcionalidades do microsoft money, que so existe para pc mas, não tem, fica muito aquém.
great small business tool. excellent on a laptop, dient handel banks with authentication dongles very well, mobile app doesn't handle them at all. can't do payroll from mobile. receipt tracking is easy and works well. reports and snap shots handy.
. it's not working.. not able to edit the invoices. i cannot work on the invoices
great app. love this app. it helps me so much
awesome app. this is a brilliant app. i have all my invoices and expenses at my fingertips. very easy to use and synchs perfectly with qbo on my mac. keeps me on track with daily reminders of overdue invoices. no one gets away with not paying me now.
easy to use, instrumental to my business. keep it glitch free please
. uggghhh..... why oh why oh why do developers continue to stuff things up with updates! get it right or leave it alone. how do i roll back to last version that worked?
won't work after update. won't work after update
app is awesome but works better on iphone than android. love the app however why can't i pull up profit loss statement graphs on my s6? this was extremely simple on my iphone 5. any help?
. needs more function like the web based app
. takes hours for a verification email with pin to get sent. i can't wait that long before i can access my accounting!
very weak. i have been a quickbooks user for years but the app is just weak. employee transactions are not possible and reports are minimal. i consider these critical aspects of good accounting software and they almost do not exist in the app. i don’t need an app to write an invoice or figure out that someone owes me money. however, keeping track of my reporting to the government and paying employees is critical and these do not exist in the app.
. when it works, its great. don't count on it when the internet is even remotely slow. i had to resort to another sales app to complete sales. lost sales and it cost me more money to use the other sales app.
. very useful, simple, and advantageous over other apps when it comes down to the feasibility and quick access.
. literally couldn't even sign in. didn't recognise my details even though i'd just signed up and was forwarded to that page by the sign up process page. wouldn't send a reset password email. honestly totally worthless and wasted my time. non starter. not even worth an admin response as it's been deleted and the competition installed already.
still can't create po's through app. i use quickbooks for 2 things mainly. to create estimatesinvoices and send pos once the invoice has been paid. i can't create po's with the app so it's useless. i have to go to the website every time i want to create a po. it makes no sense that they would leave this feature out.
easy to use on the go!. super convenient way to keep up with your accounting and invoices from anywhere on the go.
defects still in app. app was brilliant until it started alerting that my trial expires so need to upgrade when i'm on a full package and not trial version? fix needed intiut.
barely useable. it's a great idea, but too many features of the online version are not accessible on the app. perhaps the qb folks are working on upgrades
. doesnt work!!!!
jamie clarkson. makes running my construction company easier than ever before. don’t know how we ever managed without it.
. good app
waste of time and slow. i didn’t even get past the registration. the app was soo slow and laggy when i was trying to put my details in i gave up. couldn’t imagine the amount of time i’d waste trying to write up quotes or invoices on it. avoid!!!
crashing. since moving to iphone11 pro  the app keeps crashing. can’t even access it! please fix this as i have to upload receipts to my laptop to add to quickbooks! ain’t nobody got time for that........
crashes on ipad3. i have never had a problem with the quickbooks app until this update. it crashes and will not open on my ipad 3.
easy to use.. easy to use. also like customer options to pay after sending invoice.
jan 2019 update is a fail. it no longer lets you log in with your fingerprint or face id.
crashes almost immediately. running ios 12 and then 13 on an iphone 8. installed the app. put my login info in. accepted that no problem. then boom. app crashes and i’m back to my iphone home screen. rebooted my phone. deleted and reinstalled the app. makes no difference. still crashes. having this app was a big factor in my decision to run my business on quickbooks and now i’m reconsidering that before i get any deeper.
the android app is so diffrent than the ios app.. ios app has the functionality to select multiple items too an estimateorder with the multi select feature. this is missing in android. also before the update, the send comand asked the way we wanted to send the invoice and we can select email, fax application. but with the update it only send with the quickbooks email. cant send by fax anymore. please provide the share option on invoice and estimates atleast.
. excellent! this app gives me so much onthego functionality for running my business  it's perfect!
30 day trial. $13month after the thirty day trial
. scammers!!!! worst mistake you can make! this company is a bunch of scammers. i used this service for about a week and found that i can't stand it, so i canceled over a year ago. my credit card still gets charged 40 bucks every month. i've got my credit card company involved and everything. this company sucks!!!
brilliant, simple and seamless. i've been a big fan of qb for the past 10 years or more...and now that the system is online and in app format...it's all so easy and user friendly...very intuitive. you have to have this.
fantastic. amazingly simple to use and syncs with all of the apps us use for my business (nab, square, stripe and wix)
. banking is better and easier with the quickbooks app
login. wont let me log in on app or internet
awesome. great app for working on the road
great flexibility. i now use qb online for 4 different companies and find the flexibility of reporting and multiple user access great. very few problems except we could not import our existing data from pastel
newest update. loved the app until the newest update. now for some reason i can no longer receive payments from my phone. which is very frustrating. i have closed out the app, restarted my phone and still can't do it.
. works great until about a week ago. now i can't save anything from the app it won't sync basically nothing is working right with the app. i even tried installing it on another android phone and had identical problems. don't bother trying to call customer service they say they have nothing to do with the app and that's it.
don’t use the pay options.. app is great but don’t use the pay option. it took a week for the money to hit my account.
"complete shit. developers can't seem to get it right.. going from version to version will cause problems logging in. might as well not offer as a mobile app, ""on the go"" my ass. i was told ""we're working on"" (for the past 6 times i inquired) then the last time ""too bad, use the web site for now""."
not bad.... would like to be able to use it to cray an invoice and take a credit card payment on the road
". you broke the app!!! can't attach pdfs to invoices anymore!!! it litteraly worked yesterday, and today a ""new"" interface. make a deal with adobe and fix it now!!!"
it sucks. after a year it erase the clients info. and it doesn't give you the option to edit to purchase order.
loving the app.. using qb since last 14 years and smart app. lovely.
can invoice from anywhere. i can start invoices at the gym and finish them at the office ! no longer putting things off and forgetting about them we love it!
viewable. error message on download is gone, but the app lacks functionality like syncing bank data and the payroll app doesn't allow me employee editing options. if i need to see what is happening in quickbooks its all right, but it's definitely not quickbooks online mobile version
subscription bug driving me crazy!. for the last few weeks the quickbooks app has been unusable! it alerts me that my subscription has expired and will lock me out of any activities. i have been on the phone with tech support, my subscription is up to date, it gets fixed for a day and then the problem re emerges the next day. this is an excellent app when this problem does not exist. i use a fully updated ipad pro. please fix this bug!
useless app. mileage tracking is grossly inaccurate, way too many inadequacies and limitations on the invoicing and accounting features. this app is a joke. i tried it for several months and have lost money as a result of it's shortcomings. the positive reviews here must be fake. do your research and search the web for accurate reviews. i recommend everlance as a better option.
waste of time. don't bother, it doesn't work and they could not care less!!!
. this app sucks. it has stopped working and often displays incorrect information. it's super annoying. only the desktop works.
the worst app ever. this app is the worst app i have ever used. takes too long to update data .... and sync hardly ever works... does not have overview screen where it shows balances on accounts... no option to sort list differently... showing the oldest payments, open invoices on top... no option to change sorting methods... too many things to list...
not free. unless i missed it this app says free. when you try to utilize it, it asks for $$$. if i'm wrong i will change the review immediately.
. i run all aspects of my life from church to finance from the app
. great app for business
. really helpful app for managing our church finances int the go! very easy to use and gives me most tools i need to get the job done when i'm not at my computer. highly recommended.
. great app, does everything i need while out and about. makes evening paperwork easier.
great functions, easy to use. really great invoicing system. great way of keeping incomeexpense records to be able to do your own accounting. can be frustrating when trying to login on the computer sometimes requires an sms to log in even though it's from home computer.
microsoft files. no sending microsoft files as a attachment. i don't understand why there is a difference. come on guys make this a convent program fo us users,
data sync is not working. managed to get it to work. the sync only work after you pay the subscription. doesn't work during trial period. (there is an error syncing data. error code 132. 100. unable to work with it.) another problem with this mobile app is that it is unable to change the status of the estimates.
tremendous. great app been using quickbooks over the years on desktop version specially go on mobile is the best way to go there is a couple tweaks that need to be worked on for example keeping track of inventory etc. and so forth been using quickbooks pro help ticket update these features as quickbooks from other than that it's a starter
great accounting software. perfect for small business owners with less knowledge of the accounting world. very user friendly.
errors galore and inability to log into client accounts. i’m so disappointed with this app. as an accountant it would be handy to log into client accounts and check figures or enter small changes, but more often than not, i receive an error message and cannot log in. the issue renders this app completely useless.
google auth broken. can’t login to my account using google auth.
. i was scared to switch from spreadsheets to quickbooks because i thought it would be hard to use. it's not. it makes everything easier. it also made me realize my spreadsheets were way off. a good investment for small business owners.
great app. great app could use a couple more features
great app. very helpful! good to go!
. sucks keeps saying i have update available but then everytime i try to download the upgrade i get error code 927 saying unable to complete download. with current app it doesn't allow me to look up past invoices. the things i use most are not on mobile app. all i do with it is print current invoices with my wireless eprinter and find customer contact numbers to call them. needs upgrading with more features.
lacking compared to ios version. the layout and functionality compared to the ipad version is horrible and hard to use. plus there is no way for the customer to sign for invoice or estimate on tablet or phone. i am an android fan all the way, but i am going to have to purchase an ipad to get the functionality i need. i am very disappointed.
great way to run a business. the way razorsync and quickbooks works together makes it possible for me to have a life after work! there are a few more things that would make life easier but overall a big thumbs up!
no place for attachments. when i first opened the app i was so excited. i have been a quick book user for years and now everything is available at a touch from my ipad. but the only thing that was missing was a place to put attachments from the banking screen. so bummed hope this gets an update with the attachment feature.
what is its purpose. lets you review your past payments and create invoices... not much else. you cant even view account information.
won't open. i use this app daily and now it won't open! please fix this!
qbo is essential. i have my own consulting company and qbo makes running my business much more efficient. even an accountant client agrees. one of the best features is the expense recording. at a business lunch, i'll take a pic of the receipt, record the transaction and that's it. don't have to think about it again. i couldn't function without qbo!
time saver. i highly recommend this app, specially for small business. quick, easy and in combination with service m8 it's all i need.
. baixei o app porém, a propaganda e 13,99 nos primeiros 12 meses, quando vou comprar o valor passa a ser de 48,99, gostaria de saber k por que? propaganda enganosa de valor realmente ou é erro no app?
"so frustrating. ""updated"" the app... telling me now that i need a new version of the app and since i already have it, not sure what i'm supposed to do. even my accountant agrees quickbooks online is too confusing. waiting for 2016 to close out my books and use a new program."
. love the app. can do work any place.
easy accounting for nonaccountants. i am not an accountant by training, so many of the concepts were foreign to me when i first started using quickbooks. however the simple format, and easeofuse made it an easy transition for me to do most simple accounting techniques. i was able to quickly use it and soon it became an essential business analysis tool and essential for forecasting and trending.
. app is pretty much useless. pointless to have an app when i have to enter my transactions on a desktop anyway. i want general journal entries in the app (or ya know, a better way to enter my daily sales info) or my damn money back!
good. excellent app. some very slight issues with layout and the occasional page that can't be used on ipad. but overall good. would recommend to others
not working. unfortunately it's not currently working for me on my samsung s7. i keep getting errors when trying to sign in.
so easy to use!. i really like the flexibility of this app. i found it easy to set up and get started with only a small learning curve. i have the ability to use this app on the go with whichever device i have available; using my phone, tablet or laptop it really makes it the perfect software to run my very busy business and life. the fact that it's online and i can access it anytime anywhere is awesome!
perfect software for the right companies. i absolutely love it! i have a small freelance design company, so i'm billing for services and commissions. there is nothing i need that it doesn't do and do well. i don't need inventory, estimates or payroll, so this program is about as friendly to me as it could possibly be.
great app. this is very handy when running a business on the go.
worst app update. after updating the recently, app is crashing. unable to login
. would be a 5 star is the mobile app scanned and allowed multi page receipts and used ocr to recognize amounts categories etc to short data entry
it's only a trial. this looks brilliant until you've set up the account only to find out that it's a 30 trial. by that time they've got your email. well done them. clever!! immediately deleted
worst user experience. app is made of complex processes..i they are more focused on collecting data than providing service..uninstalled within 3 minutes
needs work. need more features like transfers, journal entries and ability to drill down into expenses.
great app!. great app to use! very easy and fast.
working great, love dashboard. app is easy to use on the go. some things are better done on desktop but for the most part can do a invoice from phone and accept payments.
. great app, does everything i need while out and about. makes evening paperwork easier.
great app!. works great on a samsung galaxy s5. features are coming along nicely. it would save a step to be able to add another expense from one just saved without having to back up from that record but no complaints otherwise.
. no option to import sales and purchase. even a free software in india provides this feature. need to install a third party software for that and is very confusing. purchased the service but not now i will not use this.
. instructions to cancel do not allow me to cancel my subscription.
"missing some elements, overall good. i like this app. great to be able to give client receipt right away. wish we could do deposits and reconciliations and change default ""payment due"" area."
. even though i canceled my subscription 1 month ago, it still continues to withhold money from me. good news. they took my credit card yesterday again 4.99 cad. this is second time....
doesn’t work like the app on a pc. the fact that the apps are not the same on a pc than on the ipad or mobile is frustrating. can’t see running totals on the register, can’t add transactions the same way, etc. and the kicker is the website version doesn’t work at all on the ipad, can’t scroll through the register because scroll bars are absent in chrome or safari. horrible adaptation and makes the ipad useless to conduct accounting business with quickbooks...
quickbooks online + app. quickbooks online is making my business accounts so easy. the bank connections feature allows you to sync online accounts straight into your account records. when new transactions are available, you can view and add them straight into your accounts, made easier by quicbooks match feature that marks transactions with previous similar transactions. support during setup period has been excellent which has made switching from another online accounting software quite an easy process. very impressive so far.
awesome. that's what i said in 2012. the app keeps getting better, now it's very soon to be 2017, and still the same review.. good app.
so amazing!!!!!. this has made my life so easy with estimates and invoicing.
must have for any mobile business.. great app, syncs nicely. will give 5 stars once more functionality evolves. very user friendly.
. this is not for bookkeepers i uninstall this app
. this app makes my life so much easier
credit card payments. with this new update, i cannot select payed with credit card without being prompted to swipe a card. i use square for my credit card transactions, so i don't need to use qb. only cash and check can be selected now.
great app!. easy to use, syncs nicely. very user friendly and keeps me informed while on the go!
too many error messages. for what you pay for a quickbooks online account, this app for ipad and iphone is really disappointing. i get an error message almost every single time i try and enter a new transaction. sometimes it works despite the error message, sometimes it doesn't. but i get the error every time. i can't even access the banking functions as i get an error message and nothing will load. the only function that seems to work properly is the reports section.
. i like it compared to the desktop program, i wish it had more functionality that the desktop has. i have been finding work around to get what i want done but not able to do everything like i expected. but i love being able to work in the field
. works all fine and easy to use. pro tip: if anything breaks, delete your local cache and try again 😊 (thanks to the qb support)
horrible. crashes every time. horrible customer service. move on to another app.
really loved it. sweet program. :)
. best app ever!!!!!!
. great app
crashes on opening. restating tablet did not help. uninstallinv and reinstalling did not help. disappointed. update... per instructions, emailed the person listed below. no reply. not the way to act if you want me to increase my rating.
great. great app!!
useless  data download errors. the app worked great for the past couple years and now all the sudden it keeps crashing when trying to download my data. i own a mobile business and now i'm having to preplan and print invoices before i show up because the app is useless.
nightmare. since the latest update quickbooks has been a nightmare. multimillion dollar company that relies on mobile invoicing that does not work now!
awesome app. makes invoicing quick and easy.
love it and support intuit provides. very convenient app for expensing. had an issue crashing while logging in and customer support was very quick to respond.
very good application.. i like to have this application for my business. is very help and accurate for my status of my invoices pending of payment and the aging of the customers transactions thank you for mobil quickbooks very grateful.
omg. if you don't have it you are missing out. this is the easiest and most helpful app ever.
. the app is useless. google sign in simply doesn't work. links to my invoices still open in browser even when i have the app installed.
incomparable with ipad pro. this app works terrible with ipad pro. basically made this business expense a complete waste as the app and web program useless on the ipad pro. extremely disappointed and frustrated.
okay. i'm new to doing my own bookkeeping and find this product clunky and not very easy to use. issues with importing transactions and program changing dates and the order compared to the bank. it's not very easy to see what account transfers are moving tofrom. it's hard to distinguish credits for debits. poor customer service. no good summary graphs. slow to attach receipts. multiple clicks to do basic things. cuts off file names if there too long.
track time. so far i’m pretty unhappy with this app because i thought that i could use it to track my time while i was with a client with a timer. i know that i read that somewhere when i was researching this app. that would have been a perfect feature. if this is something that i can actually do and someone can let me know how to do it i will change my rating to 4 or 5 stars.
easy to use. generally easy to use. some limitations on app.
fantastic software !. this has made my life a whole lot easier. invoice and estimates on the go. i really feel in control of my accounts.
i like it. i have enjoyed using this app for the last year. i am blind and it is 99% accessible with my screen reader, voiceover. i only want to report one error. the last update causes the app to crash when trying to edit an expense entry my accountant manages my quickbooks online account, however, when i find an incorrect category has been applied, i cannot fix it. the app crashes when i attempt
perfect app for any small business owner. as a qbo pro advisor my opinion may be somewhat biased but i can not brag enough about the software, customer support and resources offered by quickbooksintuit. qbo has allowed me to become a completely virtual bookkeeping firm, increasing my service area, customer satisfaction and turn around time. love love love them!!
convenience is nice. nice to be able to access clients remotely and get most information. would be nice to have full functionality in app. some functions are slow going from screen to screen.
no sign in recognition. i have been using the online version on my pc for a while. the mobile app will not let me sign in no matter what i do.
. not updating fields.
. we do all of our estimates and invoices through qb. we love it
inferior to qb online on desktop. qb app on ipad or android does not not have even half of the features that qb online has on a desktop. i can manage basic invoicing, basic expenses, see transactions, and pull up basic reports... everything about this app is basic. i have to actually be on my desktop to access the full features of qb online. very dissapointed.
sloooooooowwwww!!! iphone 6. very slow to do simple things like log an expense. camera feature is useless with crop feature. can i have the option to turn this off? just wanna take a photo without auto crop which 90% does a bad job. other than that its great :)
if i wanted a kick in the groin, well... i'd of watched the leafs with great hopes of the playoffs. that said, this app is the biggest chunk of dog crap in the history of humanity.. dumpster fire
. great app for small business
love it. just be cautious when trying 30 free trail. i loaded half a dozen customers and lots of estimates,invoices etc. and then purchased the 6 month subscription after i got familiar with software. well it led to doing work twice. because you can only have one or the other, free trail discounted 6 months subscription.
a j rooter. it's an easy program to use makes life a lot less aggravating when you can do your work on the road
. great software, easy to use
. this app makes it easy to take care of about 95% of my business paperwork
impressed. i put off upgrading to online version after using quickbooks pro for five years, struggling to enter online direct debit expenses and payments. online version makes entering data easy and efficient. such a time saver for me. well done intuit! definitely worth the monthly subscription fee.
. great for invoices on the go! for small business.
great small business app. just opened up my first company,being a one person office ,secretary, and boss this app is great to help micro manage all your small office responsibilities. it's a great app to email quick quotes onsite for that customer who looking for the job to get done asap. have to say this made my work day is alot easier and definitely is less complicated!!!!
awesome. looking forward to seeing what's next!. there's times when i get fuel and the gas pump printer is out of paper. i pull out my phone, snap a picture of the purchase and expense it. brilliant. i would like to itouch login option. it's not to cool punching in your password while shivering. thanks qbo.
. having the app makes quickbooks that much easier. now i can write invoices on my phone no matter where i am at. time saver!
. now, can't even access some of my clients from the app. i have sent the error logs several times to intuit, but no response. it keeps getting worse. lacking the fingerprint option to login. also, accepting transactions from bank feed in android not as smooth as it is in iphone. app starts freezing after accepting a few transactions. additionally, progressive invoicing does not work in the app. should make it more useful for accountants though, adding bank reconciliations capability would help.
after ios 13 update. after updating to ios 13 the app is not opening and i couldn’t use it.... please look into it and give us a solution
good app and getting better. really good features and helps when you are on the run. new reporting and features have been added which gives you quick company snapshots whilst you are away from the office
". constantly unable to use app  login, keep getting ""temporarily unavailable"" !!!"
this app is useless on android.. i can not believe that this app is this bad. i can only see customers invoices that i have been to in last 2 months. i use to be able to see 10 years worth of invoices. please fix asap. unless you can carry a laptop at all times which is not practical this again is useless.

mobile glitches... love using quickbooks but i run my business out of town where we are not able to have wifi other than mobile hotspot. using the quickbooks mobile has been convenient but also a p.i.t.a... glitches, closes on its own, logs me out, and sometimes doesn’t save invoicesestimates. has been like this for a while and haven’t had any changes..
. awesome app, makes management easy
love this app!. fantastic app.
worse update ever. finally you eat our petition to add calculator to the invoice keyboard and removed on this update? app freezes a lot
. i use this app while i had my quickbooks trial, and it seemed to be working fine. the minute i subscribed, the app stopped working properly. i emailed support, no one seems to be answering my questions, and when i phone the customer service, they don't know how to help with the app. i'm stuck and ready to cancel the whole thing.
took out deposit option! why?. i can no longer record simple deposits from the mobile app. i’ve been using quickbooks online for over a year now and make use of that functionality weekly. why did they take it away? not every deposit is an invoice payment.
business on the run. quickbooks online with the ios app make operating a travel based business on the run simple. log invoices as you go. input estimates along the way. print and mail or email all at once at the end of the day. not to mention the helpful reports and expense management. i couldn't run my business without it.
easy. great app that is so simple to navigate, and dead easy for business novices. well designed.
great app to run my business. easy invoicing have app set up and operating in less then 30 min
. great app trying to start a small business this is very helpful thanks
very nice!. i love have this power in my phone! i can email invoices or print them out, all on my phone! this app is easy to learn and soooooo fast when you get used to it. there was a lot of thinking when they designed this app, wow
swapping to a customised invoice. would love to swap to a customised invoice on a ipad or iphone app and not have to work off a laptop to do it... if it’s possible i can’t seem to find out how to do it
five stars!. has helped out tremendously when it comes to my business. it makes it so much easier to use then the paper receipt books. it helps me stay organized and keeps me updated to the second. thanks quickbooks!
good app.. very nice program. works best with my ipad.
contractor. love this app
awesome. this app is great and very robust
less than useless. this app does not interface enough of the information from the desktop version. reports are raw numbers and can’t pull up any supporting information. p&l is worthless. the desktop version seems to miss the point of accounting software. ie making all your information easy to input then easy to analyze in reports. this does neither. qbpro etc was far easier to navigate without the slick graphics and colors. aaaaaargh!
what a joke.. can't add notes to customers. buggy! cant print. awful. if you are moving from qb desktop, think again! there's not even an easy way to just view today's business. no reports in app. useless.
hostetler's construction llc. i love to be able to estimate from where ever i'm at without the computer , call customers from the quickbooks contacts . rexieve payments . all the time people want to know how or what i had quoted ,,, and its always at my fingertips ....
great app overall. great improvement to the app. can pull up a lot of information on demand. still need some better viewing of bank register on the app. also need to be able to click on expenses in p&l to drill down into the detail. still a great app, but areas to improve.
great app. can see my transactions in real time.
. good app
. disappointed...like horribly disappointed! this was supposed to make my life easier but instead i lost multiple hours either trying to figure the desktop version out to then trying the app and the tax rate were getting doubled...while chatting with help desk to be told that it would get fix a week after still didn't fix. uninstalled to try to start fresh to realize the price had gone up! chatted again with customer service to be told someone would contact me within 2 hours...still waiting!
so very useful!. i run a dog walking business and basically manage my entire business with my s4, this app and a printer. so easy to set up and maintain. i am very happy with quickbooks and would definitely recommend to others.
could be great. this app takes care of basic needs but it could be amazing. i'm unsure of why intuit chose to cut the corners it did. examples: there is no check option in the + there is no bank deposit option in the + tapping my bank acct on the home page takes me to my chart of accounts. huh? there needs to be some polishing.
very helpful. quickbooks is really very helpful tool for startups. for us it has actually saved money. we could go back to our suppliers asked them invoices they have not provided. saved on wrong charges if any. also got futuristic view on our growth with balance sheet analysis. thank you quickbooks
. great app
broken after update. not updating customer data, crashing, please fix it, i have a business to run!
great for invoices on the go. they charge things every so often after you get used to the way it is.
great. great app, ensures all my needs and saves me time so that i can be out in the field more often
quickbooks is good but…. slight learning curve and seems to have a few annoying bugsquirks.
so simple and quick to use. i have downloaded the app and have been using it for my self employed hairdressing. it is so easy to use and because i use my phone often it's great to pick it up at the end of the day and track my takings in which means i never have to worry about not being up to date. i would highly recommend this to anyone who wants an easy and simple way to keep detailed accounts!
fantastic. easy to use on all my mobile devices. makes small business operations much easier when you cannot afford office staff.
. awesome app
. great app
crashes. crashes during loading on ios 9. won't make it past log in screen. qb should have been prepared for the new ios release.
. dont bother if you dont have access to pc or laptop.basic features like editing customer email is not available on mobile devices including tablets.if an invoice isnt sent because the recipient email address sends it back,you have no way of knowing that an error has occurred even when attempting to check via any web browser.caused me £1000's of cashflow headache. contacted customer support,got a nonsensical response.made it sound like the problem is an actual feature of the app and software.
prettt good. it’s a good app, i’d have given it 5 stars but the sequential number doesn’t load when using the app. this means to produce an invoice you have to go back and look up the last invoice number.
perfect app for any small business owner. as a qbo pro advisor my opinion may be somewhat biased but i can not brag enough about the software, customer support and resources offered by quickbooksintuit. qbo has allowed me to become a completely virtual bookkeeping firm, increasing my service area, customer satisfaction and turn around time. love love love them!!
small business app. good small business app. careful, they will rock bottom your entry price, get you hooked, then double or more your cost.
. absolutely overwhelming! you surround yourselves with the most incredible and pleasant staff. bill, just like the the other individuals that i talked with in the last two days are extraordinary and simply the best. thanks a lot for all your help. pedro
. was working awesome until last update. now won't log in. just has that loading thing come up forever
can't record an expense. i get an error message please choose a template before saving. doesn't work since ios 13 was installed.
super & excellent apps. very user friendly application . i would recommend this software to other people
quickbooks a real sage beater!. having been a sage customer for over 15 years i wish i had discovered quick books sooner, why did i spend all that money on yearly updates when i didn’t need too. i absolutely would recommend quickbooks to everyone and i do! thanks for a great product guys 👍🏻
. had difficulty with seeing my total mileage, but was guided by a rep.
still needs work. one thing needed i’d making it easier to change customers info when doing a new invoice for a previous customer but at a new address. i have many customers that own many places and i need to be able to put the address in for each place where the work is done with that same customer and the app doesn’t allow this to happen.
quickbooks online. great app. saves having to cart round invoice pads.
. very useful.
great app. very happy with this app!
limited compared to quickbooks desktop. quickbooks online is just ok. it has some limits that did not exist in the desktop version. a lot of them have to do with assisted payroll. for example, the app does not tell you each pay period how much of a contribution to pay towards simple ira's and give you a chance to indicate whether they were paid. it just assumes it was done without giving you any notice. other limitations make it just ok.
. sole trader; i was spending hours on spreadsheets before finding this app. it has frozen a couple of times at inopportune moments but overall great. the ability to create a purchase order on my phone is the only missing link so far. 5 stars!
"pure garbage. i've had several issues with accessing features and each time their ""solution"" was to create a new account and start over because they couldn't fix it. and now they are raising the monthly price, yet again. i'm done with qb online. seriously, save your money and use the desktop version with your own remote access."
it's just not the same as online. though the app does do most of the basic functions that you can do online it is still lacking some of the advantages to just doing it online. it is convenient to be able to access it on the go but it should be as versatile as the online version, also some of the menus are a little confusing on the app.
too many clicks for attachments. i keep track of all transactions by taking pictures of the receipt, checks, deposit receipts, and just about everything then attach them to the transaction. with the user interface rule of thumb of three clicks access to specific functions, attachments can take as many as five to six clicks to save a picture, which is very annoying and time consuming.
. this app is easy to use, once you get the hang of it. i can take pictures of all receipt which makes it easy to keep track.
can't even open an account!. i live in spain and the app won't accept my mobile number. i even tried a uk number but even that doesn't work. thumbs down for not even letting international customers to use or even view the product.
. takes ages to load then crashes to a black screen. i have had the app for 3 months or so and only ever got it working for a few moments once. as it is so unreliable i could not trust it as an app to rely on, for example to use in front of a customer in their home, therefore i cannot recommend this app. i run a ltd company and we use qb as our accounting software.
this might be 5 stars. the only thing... only thing!!! using square through the app .. or somehow sync invoices so they reflect in qb. if there is a way to do that then this is 5 stars!!
bugs. there are alot of bugs in the app. i am about to go back to square. the app keep giving alot of errors.
. can't login. the web version works at least.
awesome app. it's very user friendly and informative. i really like how easy it is to assign an expense category and the convenient display of the profit  loss feature.
. i can't believe how functional this app is. i love how much i can do from my phone, an it's all in sync all the time with what i do from my tablet or computer. it's great
impressive for mobile. i posted a bad review because of some bugs. i received an immediate response about upcoming updates and a week later it was fixed. i love that level of support. nice app too.
still no touch id. i used to think this was a great app, but now with these last 2 updates, i have to constantly uninstall the app and still no touch id. why when something works fine can you not just let it be. please fix back
milage. like what it offers but for me to pay for it i need a way to track milage. this is the one huge advantage the desktop version has that the app doesn't seem to offer.
. stan f. would be great if it has signature capture so that a customer can sign the invoice or receipt. the ipad version has the signature capture feature but quickbooks wants 12.99 per month just to be able to use the ipad app and other 27.00 per month for the online essentials account. thats 480.00 per year just to be able to get a signature capture feature that is only available for the ipad version. quickbooks too primitive
limited features in the app. the app has extremely limited features as compared to web cant send customer statements or edit recurring transactions or match partially paid invoices.
cancelar assinatura. fiz uma pergunta sobre cancelar assinatura e responderam algo na com nada. será que vocês podem responder como cancelo a assinatura, pois não utilizarei o app? aguardo um retorno obrigado
great app for busy employersemployees. your features are reduced and it's not the exact same as when you use a pc but it is still really nice. i would not be want it to be as in depth anyways it's nice and simple. i would recommend it to anybody that needs quickbooks on the go. we do a lot of work in the field and it is really nice to do estimates and email them to the customer while standing right next to them.
qbo in general needs work. this app is limited in what you can do. qbo was rolled out before they were finished developing even some of the most basic features.
company activity and payments are not updating!. the new version does not work!!
". crashes too much. many times new customers and info can't be seen on the app, unless i uninstall and reinstall!!! i get a ""unable to refresh"" message constantly. it's extremely hard to enter new customers and revise existing ones from the app."
. great app so far
. i use qb app every day. very user freindly
needs a calendar interface. great app, a clickable calendar link would make it more user friendly
useless. app is slow and hard to use.
ios app > than the web version. it is pleasantly surprising to see that the app is faster on the phone in comparison to the website! keep up the good work 👍🏼
"""sign in"" button doesn't work.. couldnt create an account because the button to send verification sms wouldn't work. no time for that. moved on."
love qb online. i love everything about it. my favorite features are the qb app and being able to process bids and invoices from my phone! and being able to accept online payments thru the invoicing feature is awesome too.
great app. i personally find the app easier then the desktop version. everything is quick and easy to do. raise an invoice or estimate instantly and see your bank account balance. great.
"so disappointing. in a never ending but now predictably disappointing offering that intuit calls its cloudbased offering ""quickbooks online"" we have a fantastically buggy and seamfull application with even more limited functionality than the web application. unfortunately it's a ""beggars can't be choosers"" scenario yet again as intuit continues to monopolize the market by utilizing profits for acquisition of competitors, rather than listening to customers to develop it's cloudbased core competencies. shakes head in disappointment."
great, clean app. although it's yet another expense for your business, it's well worth every cent. more of an investment for us and we use it for four different companies (yes four times the subscription fee). regardless, it will manage your company's finances as they should be. leaving you with less hassle and worries about your accounts and more time to focus on more important entrepreneurial things.
effective. efficient. essential.. began using quickbooks at my brothers recommendation. it unified our estimating and invoicing process and surpassed expectations with all the numerous functions. it will quickly becoming your single source accounting software. to add on to this review qb has become vital to our growth and receivables are paid timely. we have recently switched from square to using qbo's merchant services and have had a seamless process. fincite group
disappointing. i've been a longtime user of the desktop version of quickbooks for the past 20 years and just recently switched to quickbooks online. i was really looking forward to managing my company's expenses, print checks, and enter bills from my new ipad. i am terribly disappointed in the complete lack of features available in this app. it's actually completely useless and a waste of memory. how could intuit release such a piece of garbage such as this?
quickbooks mobile app. i love the flexibility this app offers. it's a huge step and my personal goal to become paperless while giving me the ability to bill on site.
bad customer service and bad app. i’m use only one month is the most terrible app. never used this app
mobile app. not happy. i am on the phone with support everyday. won't print on app or on chrome. they don't know what to do. this mobile is worthless to me. i don't have time for this!
loved it. easy and very useful
uh huh. does exactly what it's supposed to.
. keeping update and on track
slick accounting app. just as the title says, very easy to use for on the go accounting and collaboration between accountants & ceo's
qb makes me look good. qb app is fantastic. i can write and present an estimate right at the job site or give my customer an invoice, or accept payment. in brief....it makes me look good!
works good for me. i use quick books to invoice, put in costs, and see roughly how the company is doing financially. easy to use. i read all reviews but some are not liking it while others do. depends on what your using it for. simple and easy that's what i like.
. awesome app. sabes me countless hours and allows me to have a simple effective mobile office for my contracting company
owner. online is getting better with each update still has a few more options i would to able to perform from mobile and laptop being using qbooks for 11 yr
. tried twice now to add my bank account and no luck, keeps saying i'm logged in on another device but i'm not. been into online support twice now and they can't fix it so the app is pointless to me
actually makes accounting a little bit fun. i absolutely love the way this app allows me to record, photograph and categorise expenses from receipts. so easy that it actually is fun. delighted that i can get rid of all this paper!
quickbooks on iphone ios 13 wont open. can you please fix the bug i can’t log in osi 13
. this app is very user friendly, that's important for a person with no accounting experience
poor experience with qb customer service. does not integrate with wells fargo merchant account. was very disappointed with customer service representative to get information on how to implement quickbooks pos. ended up going with wf, and would probably have gone with qb pos if we had all the facts. representative was flippant, condescending, and rude.
great for the mobile user. some bugs but they get fixed sooner or later
useless software. quickbooks is slow, has errors and the support is probably the worst i have ever had to use. we had an issue where we could not roster our staff for over a week due to a quickbooks error and every interaction with their support team has been horrible. the api to payroll is slow and buggy and they keep upping the prices. use another service!
geeat. awesome app...!!!!!!
. reliable app however does not have all the features, available in the product range
. great app, similar to desktop version.
mileage is a joke. i upgraded to this account from the self employed version and the mileage is a joke. i thought the self employed was horrible. it completely missed a whole day of travel and cut’s off trips in the middle of traveling. or cuts the trips starting and ending if it even records the visit.
crashes too much, stressful. doing accounting is difficult enough. why did quickbooks create an app that crashes and creates frustration then?!
great invoicing and management tool. awesome tool to keep your small business running at its best. highly automated, making it very easy to work with.
starting with errors. i am just starting my beekeeping business and trying to track expenses. quick books somehow has me making a $164 sale. i can't erase it because it doesn't exist. would love it but can't reconcile the books if random numbers are calculated out of thin air!
needs work. this won't stay up to date with online or desktop app and i regularly get error messages. this is frustrating and useless.
limited compared to quickbooks desktop. quickbooks online is just ok. it has some limits that did not exist in the desktop version. a lot of them have to do with assisted payroll. for example, the app does not tell you each pay period how much of a contribution to pay towards simple ira's and give you a chance to indicate whether they were paid. it just assumes it was done without giving you any notice. other limitations make it just ok.
logging out.... every time i open the app, it logs out. so now i have to keep my qb password with me. love qb but hate this app. have raised the issue, been ignored.
needs features. app seems to get bug fixes but vary rarely does it get new features. as a mobile professional i would like to have the same features in the app as on the computer. currently investigating other more powerful mobile options vs quick books update: can't even enter expenses with the app only a pc! in the usa they can enter expenses with the app.... wish i could deduct an extra star just for that.
. excellant app helped taking the stress out of book keeping
app not working on my phone. app is currently not even loading before it crashes. nextbit robin on marshmallow 6.0.1. sent error report weeks ago and nothing yet...
good app and service. after the last update, i can’t create an invoice after i add a customer. it crashes every time on my ipad. it still works on my phone. please fix this issue.
support is lost. you talk to them and there continued response is uninstallreinstall.. constant technical problems
money grabber. quickbooks will offer subscription service. i paid for it because of the discount and then they didnt allow me to accept payments through their app. you have to assess the profile first before asking for payment.
. naughty. doesn't tell you untill you've down loaded and set up it's only a free trial. now looking through it i can't find anywhere to delete to make sure i'm not charged.
too many errors to count. i’ve been using mint for years and love it. this software on the other hand is terrible. save yourself the frustration and use anything else.
the best invoice app. very simple to use and helps a lot! i recomend
pointless. useless app. can’t even see any supplier invoices etc. what is the point of having the app if you can’t work fully on the go!?
logo input. is there an advanced function to insert company logo in the paid version . if yes i will consider subscribing
don’t waste your time. the developer is very slow to fix bugs and non responsive when a complaint or ticket is generated. the tax rates are a total mess in the app. there is very little control over adding new or editing existing rates generated by qb while using the online version. any time i use an apple product i have the same issue.
. perfect app for a small business
don't bother. been using qb desktop for years. disapointed in the sasmobile version. mobile app is slow and frequently fails to load at all. not much functionality at all besides creating invoices. checking account balances or customer ar is not worth the bother on mobile app. this is an ok solution. i bet there are better options available than qb mobile app.
doesn't work for ipad. this app doesn't even load my company info. it keeps returning error trying to load company info. i have contacted quickbooks a number of times and all they say is they are working on the issue and to use a web browser version in the mean time. i have seen about 4 updates released and not one of them has fixed this issue. when will this be fixed?
just like the web version. the new updates are great. it's just like the web version minus tax lodgements which is possibly due to regional differences. the only gripe i have is the lack of keyboard integration which means you will need to use the touch screen but it's an ipad app so can't really complain there.
disappointing. came to try it out. won't let me add sales tax. tried adding a note, pressed done and
employees. was charge $30 for three months for payroll, which i was not using. called the payroll department and they took care of me: refunded the cash into my account without question.
great bookkeeping app. this is a great app for tracking expenses sending invoices and overall bookkeeping. it is especially great if you are a mobile service and always on the go, easytouse from your phone or tablet or computer!
. unable to see customer payment transactions and limited functionality. unable to generate detailed customer statements.
couldn't run my business without it!. this is an incredible program! my favorite thing about it is how mobile it is. my business is all out in the field... so i'm always creating invoices, collecting payment, and writing receipts often times right in front of my clients. i can literally do each one of these tasks in less than one minute. customers are impressed, records are kept uptodate, and my mind is at peace. very satisfied!
google calendar. it would be nice to be able to sync google calendar with the mobile app for invoices like you can do on the mac app.
crashes on open. useful app until this update. it crashes on open, both on ipad and iphone. cannot do business this way...
major issues.. i am a plumbing contractor and mobility is so important. currently i have multiple estimates for the same customer. it would be great if i could search for an estimate by a job name or a po. right now if i want to look up a specific estimate i have to open and check every single one in hopes i find the right quote. need a better reference system to look up estimates and invoices.
amazing app. i love this app makes everything easier for me and faster. this app is amazing i just love it!
. great app, really so much better than anything else, there are a few things i would like to improve my experience... hard to explain... but i'll try... when i assign expenses on my phone, i have to go on to a desktop to tick billable.... does that make sense?
. i have much more to learn but it has met all of my needs after 3 months making the accounting easy.
quickbooks rocks. this is the next level stuff our parents could only dream of having at their disposal. this program rocks!
great product. great for any small startup or established business. gives you the tools to keep up with the income and expenses for taxes. pay bills and payroll quickly and efficiently.
need improvement. it needs improvements so dont download untill it has updated
confusing. i used the trial a little while ago, and sort of went off it. just renewed the subscription now with the exact the same email, but quickbooks somehow created a new company instead! the support for backing up the company’s data is all over the place, since there are so many variants of the softwareapp.
. great app does everything you need it to do on the go. perfect!
. i used the app mainly to create invoices when i'm out of the office. it's so awesome to be able to do this on the fly!
horrible. app force closes. give me a refund on my account if i can’t access it mobile..... 0 stars
. i don't want to get charged tomorrow! i went to manage my subscription to cancel then an error came up and i've still got the message saying payment comes out tomorrow without an option to change it. the button has gone.
. qbo is great... however, the app sucks! the info on the home page is rarely if ever correct. paid invoices show as still do, p&l info is incorrect compared to what it shows on the website. now i can't edit downloaded transaction to add an image of my receipts. plus, it's no longer showing all of my accounts when i go to categorize a transaction. what the heck happened?!
hate this app. waste of data & time too
. great software and service for small companies
it’s having to log in constantly. i’ve been having a really problem with my ipad six generation lately, anytime i exit the app while writing up a quote and bounce backandforth between the information i need to enter into quickbooks. the app suffers a critical crash causing me to login several times with in an hour span. are there any bug fixes coming up? i suffer the same issue with my iphone xr and ipad pro.
sync problema.... does not sync transactions with business bank and credit card unless you login to the quicbooks website...i have to login to the website all the time to use the app..what good is the app..disappointed that such a well funded company can have such a poorly developed app
. i just got the program so far i really like it
. love this app. making work so much easier. & reminds me of what needs paying & when someone hasn't paid. making the company alot more up to date & finally in the 21st century!
. and using quickbooks desktop for 15 plus years. the online version makes a lot of activities more convenient. overall good experience
good software. this software is very awesome. i work for the company but also use it for my own personal budgeting and it is extremely helpful but there are still a lot of bugs that need to be worked out with this app so that all the information updates correctly.
. i use quickbooks on a daily basis and having a mobile app makes my job so much easier!! you can do anything on the app that you can on the computer. i'll continue to use this great service and app for my business.
great but needs to add acct payable. love the app but can't look up status of payments to vendors and outstanding bills to be paid.
. decent it's ok for adding expenses... but account balances are significantly lacking... i.e. non existent! must have!
. does not work its rubbish app
. emailed 3 times now would be nice to get a reply as would like a refund due to canceling my subscription in the first 30day free trial but have still been charged for it. sent a email to the reply i got and since then got no reply again.
"no support. staff is rude. need help checking on billing and the person says it's not my job. you can google the number for that question. i was like what support do you provide? her exact words "" nothing""!"
very very useful. this app is a great way of using quick books online. some limitations compared to using the full version via the web but enough to make things a lot easier and on the spot. one star off for limitations etc but recommend.
nifty. the app won't do everything the website does, but it's a handy tool for when you're out and about.
. very bad experience.
app constantly glitches and it's very slow. i've had so many issues with this app. lately it has been extremely slow, it randomly shuts down for no reason in the middle of inputting a transaction and it won't load larger invoices. i'm very disappointed as i use this on a daily basis for my business.
l hill,president, ceo. at roomsaround campus llc, we use quickbooks all day long to handle our rental properties. tenants can get up to the minute information on their account and we know exactly where we stand fiscally. but what i really love is that rent payment which are sent out automatically, electronically with a link to the intuit payment network, are posted automatically. wow, what a time saver. oh, and the support is fantastic too.
"problematic app. upon originally downloading this app i was pleased. for the first 24hrs. i was impressed. then, i ""sent"" an invoice which the customer never received. next, it failed to update or sync with my account. when i attempted to update manually it chronically reported an error sighting that i should check my internet connection. frustrated, i uninstalled and reinstalled the app. now, it doesn't stay open for long before saying it stopped unexpectedly. i've reported every error without receiving any feedback."
owner. useful for small business. able to use mobile app and coordinate with online.
. this is a great app! makes billing expenses and invoicing so much easier!
. será que me pueden ayudar, no puedo hacer ningún tipo de registro en el sistema. envié un correo y nadie me ha respondido
awesome!. so easy to categorize expenses and view financial statements in seconds!
mr. doesn't work on ipad pro or iphone. it says my subscription has expired. i have had it for several years and it still works on macbook but on ios it thinks i am on a free trial until 13th april but still locks me out saying i need to update my subscription. it is useless to me if it won,t work on ipad because i photograph all my receipts into the app. will cancel subscription if it doesn't work soon.
i'm underutilizing this app!!. this app is way more capable than the extant than i'm using it for! the best for of the app is on the ipad. the worst form is on my mbp.
fantastic app for small business. i have been using quickbooks for a year now. before i used to use myob and it used to cost me double what i pay now. it has all the features i need and usually works without any problems. i can write up quotes onsite, and send invoices before i leave the job. i highly recommend this app for small businesses.
outstanding. i love the new quickbooks app it allows me to invoice and estimate my customers in a snap it also allows me to bring the point of sale in the home credit card processing is very easy also my favorite feature is that i am able to transfer my contacts into my quickbooks customer list with the press of a button
sales tax calculation is wrong. when creating an invoice, the app does not honor customer's sales tax setting. it applies tax even on customers with tax turned off. please fix asap!!!!
great services. as a small business owner this software offers me everything i need.
pretty good. it’s really great but there’s a couple of things you can’t do like work on reoccurring invoices.
great app. i don't understand what some people are complaining about it. this app works great. thank you
. works great if you need a serious business financial app that works as well in the field as it does at the office.
excellent. the app is a great supplement to the online version when i'm on the road. i easily make customer invoices, add expenses that i have purchased. nothing is lost or forgotten. great way to keep everything up to date
works like it should!. the app works well and most everything is in the same place as the desktop version.
lousy service. spent all morning trying to upload an expense only to be told i had no internet connection. can't it determine i have no server connection? so most of the morning i spent in one que after another and finally hanging up. i must say that the convenience of being mobile outweighed the inconvenience of not having too much versatility, but only if i am able to be mobile. i hate wasting time, and so i want payback.
bank connection. bank updates inconsistent.
love it!. keeps me on track with customer invoices and payments.
. capable app for your expenses and keeping tabs on accounts on the go.
. love this app!! so simple and extremely convenient.
. great app
. great app
. horrible, did not notify of subscription issue. data entered not commited to database. double charged my credit card. terrible customer service (james refusing a last name or initial from customer care) experience, nothing resolved. no response from error logs. called and even gave control of my computer. never did intuit offer any fix. ongoing issues over 6 months damaging my business.
. this is a very user friendly app. i can modify and create estimatesinvoices on the fly! good work intuit!
. great app
best thing for the business, ever!. it's simple and easy to use  from someone who is learning how to run a business and manage accounts from scratch, it is the best money we've ever spent. saves time, looks professional and great value for money considering the price of an accountant!
. app is not opening. i have so much data in it please fix the issue
. awesome app
this app makes billing so much easier, which gives me more time for other tasks.. it is a must have for small business owners, especially new ones.
help. the android app is very very slow it takes a long time to change a estimate to a invoice i have emailed support several times about the issue with no reply please speed it up.
amazing. i haven't seen smart accounting software like this 👍🏼
spotty & unreliable. i rarely review any apps that i use unless they are particularly great or particularly terrible. in this case, sadly it is the latter. this app doesn't have basic features that should be included, and about half of my invoices i cannot open from the app because apparently it uses some feature in their api that is nonsupported or not working. regardless, if you are looking for a 21stcentury accounting solution and app this is sadly not it at all.
last update ruined a great app. invoices won't save now and a customer file disappeared. please fix this app back to operational use soon!
loving it. been hunting for a simple app for managing the finances of my farm business. this helps me with capturing and analysis of all my expenses and income. the reporting is also amazing. i also love the fact that i can even get more stats and reports via the web. amazing stuff. already introduced it to quite a number of industry colleagues. truly an amazing app
good app. very useful
great way to run a business. the way razorsync and quickbooks works together makes it possible for me to have a life after work! there are a few more things that would make life easier but overall a big thumbs up! one more star for a stronger search engine, can't find invoices by number or customers by address
when it works. i rely heavily on the quickbooks mobile app. when it works, it works great. but every once in a while, it goes down, for days.
gerald. tax . tax here applied is actually confusing as only sales tax is taken into account. it's as if purchases or expenses are not taxed. if you need to claim tax on purchases or expenses doesn't show anything. it's as if i do it manually or. how do i import quickbook intuit into quickbooks online. or why not merge some features in intuit to online. it's not only as you say to do invoice as you go but you can't account for your taxes.
. this app is honestly magnificent. it helps me balance my checkbook. helps me track expenses and send invoices. it's honestly a must.
. não consigo acessar. tenho login e senha mas me aparece uma mensagem que a função não é aceita somente via web
. very confusing, it's easier to just go to the website.
fantastic for when you’re on the move. this app has really helped me operate more efficiently from a mobile office. the ability to quickly and easily produce quotes and invoices from my ipad has been extremely useful. the app isn’t as fully featured as its desktop counterpart but it does enough to suit my needs, whilst i’m on the move. i’m running this app on a 10.5 ipad pro and it has been flawless.
. app looks great.
. great app, easy to use!
. if you have a service business and you hate writing up invoices, this is an awesome app. helps you keep up. if you have internet, you can send invoices anywhere in the world at any time
. qbo a great experience, seamless on mobile and desktop. highly recommend!
overall works great.. you should be able to delete an invoice without having to log in from the computer. ok i stand corrected thank you for the help and a very quick response! i now can say 5 stars! i will see how easy this transitions to turbo tax at the end of the year. hopefully it does with out any issues. but for now i love it.
ios 13. keeps crashing in ios13 faceid log in  can u fix it please. thank you all fixed now
messed it up with update. i don't like that invoices send through intuit, nor that the app no longer integrates with gmail for emailing clients. please get rid of the pretty colors and fix the functionality. this update really makes the app much harder to use.
makes it easy. quickbooks has done nothing but make my life as a new business owner a breeze. i can expense purchases, write up invoices and so much more right from my phone when i'm out of the office it's amazing. i don't know where i would be without quickbooks
mechanic shop. just starting out with the program but it seems to work great!!!
. great software . still learning.
. i love the ability to issue invoices and check the current payment status. bring able to photo receipts and record expenses as and when they happen is a great touch too.
great to use on the go!. love this app. i use it alongside the website, this is on my phone. it's not as easy to navigate around as the website but it's not intended to use totally on its own. i love being able to send invoices whilst doing other things  really helps me to consolidate my time.
doesn’t work like the app on a pc. the fact that the apps are not the same on a pc than on the ipad or mobile is frustrating. can’t see running totals on the register, can’t add transactions the same way, etc. and the kicker is the website version doesn’t work at all on the ipad, can’t scroll through the register because scroll bars are absent in chrome or safari. horrible adaptation and makes the ipad useless to conduct accounting business with quickbooks...
. excellently great app
. very user friendly app to use
continuing issues. i've had the online and app for over a year and a half but the last 6 months it's a pain. double entries and trouble meshin with my bank for 2.5 months. ugh frustrating
turnover. i just really want to know how much i’ve turned over this month. can’t see how to get this easily in this app. in the desktop version it is on the desktop. can’t find anything about this
great. this app helps my small business tremendously. very easy to navigate, enter and retrieve data. very affordable.
terrible product and now doesn't even connect. previous reviews are on the money, this app is terribly crippled on ipad and mobile. to make it worse some days, like today i can't even connect to do these limited tasks. intuit please wake up before you get rolled over like blackberry!!!
made my life easier. i use to spend all weekend doing paper work and now i do it as i go in the car.
. something happened past few days keeps crashing, can't open the app.
. great app
great invoicing on the go. this is great for a business thats on the go. only negative you cannot make changes to the invoice once done.
. i've used qb for 8 years. this app is the better and more seamless than the pc version. love the capability to invoice customers on the job, record payments and send a receipt in seconds.
. enjoying this app, life made easy...
. ease of use. ability to send professional estimatesinvoices from anywhere. the ability to load price list makes creating estimates and invoices easy.
super & excellent apps. very user friendly application . i would recommend this software to other people
great ui and mobile to desktop experience. i just started using quickbooks about two months ago and i don't know what i would do without it now. it's simple, easy to run a freelance business with. it's helped me become a freelance business and get paid which is the most important part :)
great app for small business. simple easy to set up and use on the road.
why don't have auto feel?. outo sense is not working.pick your item from product list (lose time) it's difficult to use online app. they have to make better like invoice2go
love it. i love the quickbooks program because all of my employees can log into the program from different locations at the same time. it works great with my small business to easily access invoices as well as the payment logs.
. just was on hold for 20 minutes and the issue is not resolved. the app is not allowing me to save information. also the online platform is not working with third party apps with the new tax rates in saskatchewan (reciept bank) been waiting for that fix for 3 weeks.
. origionally i wanted to use this app for easy application of spreadsheets and invoices, unfortunately when everything wasn't working out for me, i decided to pull the plug and cancel my subscription. unfortunately, it is hard to get a cancellation and stop the reoccurring payments and it has brought me here. i would recommend that you guys make it easier for others to manage your subscription accounts.
great app!!!!!. great app for your business. really makes things easier and proactive. it also tracks everything
do not upgrade to new ios. stopped working with new ios. people pay for this. clearly everyone is having this problem based on recent reviews. zero testing was done for the new ios release. zero. the search for something better has begun.
crash instantly on iphone 5. this app crashes instantly and doesn't operate on my iphone 5 running the latest iphone software. i tried removing and reinstalling but it still doesn't work. why don't you guys fix this?
awesome. i have an hvac business and everything in this app is awesome. the invoicing,estimates,collecting payments, emailing invoices or estimates, the whole thing. my wife does the books and she loves this version of quickbooks better than the pro version. i can access it from my ipad or iphone and my wife can access it from her samsung phone. all around great app. you do have to have the quickbooks online version on a computer and it has a monthly fee, but well worth it.
an excellent tool for my onsite work!. for several years, i've used this app to instantly create invoices right at completion of the task. it never has let me down, and i walk out with payment!
great product!. i'm good at what i do for a living, but i am not an accountant and i needed help keeping the financial end of my business on track. this product is easy to use and is everything i needed!
great app for accounting on the go!. i don't know why people are disappointed in this app it's an app, not an entire accounting software. plus it's free! i love this app. i can create, manage & send invoices on the go. that's all i need to do. it has a simple interface. kudos to qb.
needs more. works good but simple
. nyc app
great app. this app has been a big help. flawless!!!!
no packing list option. packing list and ability to share invoive via text, fax, or any messenger app
works. 3 small companies, always on the go. this a is a handy solution....my accountant loves it to.
. have used quickbooks online for many years and i am very happy with how easy it is to use and the email invoices are extremely professional looking.
. excellent app.
great app. love the flexibility it gives me!
. great app.
easy to use. the more i play the more i like. simple enough to teach a novice bookkeeping, comprehensive enough to know where the money goes instantly.
great program. great program and its user friendly too.
would rate 0 star if i can. only works in trial version. bought it 3 days ago and hasn't work since. i emailed customer support from both itunes and quickbooks with no help. keeps asking me to subscribe (when i already have). i couldn't use it. it's useless.
worst customer service. it’s like comcast great product but terrible customer service. i have online payroll service with them and i have been trying to merge my desktop quickbook version to online and bundle every time i call they transfer the phone to the philippine and they try to sell me the service that i already have (payroll) . it’s either they charge for full service or they irritate people.
. awesome app that assists me to carry out my personal finance activities
great small business app. love this app for my working vacations!
. great way to keep track of my invoices for my company
. vg and lot much improved with very good customer care support. thankx.
major flaw. the app ui is pretty good and i really like the interface. the problem is that a lot of my invoices are not even viewable on the app. basically anything that has a delayed charge on it won't show up so there is a major glitch there or something.
great app!. it's clear they've put a lot of thought into the experience here. smooth ui and they keep adding features. thank you!
great app. best software for small business, better priced than other software on the market.
great system easy to use. i really like the online version better than the windows. the app is easy to use there's some issues with it though, i would ole like it better if you could use and access every thing as if you were on your computer. i don't always have time to sit down at the desk and go threw every thing.
good but could be better. overall quickbooks online is a reliable usable and productive app. it continues to lack obvious things like an ap screen on the landing page and better shortcuts to accounts. but it does the job well.
". update 101619: still useless as constant login issues persist, why use the app if i constantly have to uninstallreinstall + clear cachedata. constantly unable to use app  login, keep getting ""temporarily unavailable"" !!!"
love it so easy to use.. what a great app simple to use and the support is there if you need. would differently recommend it to anyone who runs a small business.
pants app! does not refresh, to many glitches!. poor show on the app! creates more work for me then needed, stick to logging in online. far easier than trying to refresh the app manually, i'll get grey before i can do any accounting with this app!!
does not function. doesn't load new invoices. app is now useless.
. this app is great. i can do everything from my phone. i'm can update at any moment and keep an eye on clients who are running late on payments.
. the new update just doesnt detect internet connection and hence cant login.
does not work with ios 13. beware!. crash on launch when using it on ios 13.
no customer service. i like the application and the features which can be improved of course, but i can't give them more then two star. is more than one week and no technical support. i can't buy this application without support.
can't bring myself to use it.. it's nowhere near as useful as the desktop app. i'd love to be able to create an invoice on my phone or tablet and upload photos right from the device. can't do it yet.
terrible experience with customer support. we had terrible experience with customer support. for a very important issue we contact qb customer support team, we wait for 6 days an never respond our request. for this incident we can't bill our invoices. we hate our experience. consider customer support if your company needs help.
. this is a pretty amazing service, and i highly recommend. the only complaint i have is that the setup of products doesn't make a lot of sense to me, by way of required categories that i don't quite have nailed down, but honestly that seems more like user error. love it, haven't looked back since.
unusable after new update. virtually unusable after new update. worked well before that.
great app. thanks
update broke. i cannot accept transactions. the only things accessible on the baking screens are back and trash. please fix otherwise it’s useless.
love the changes. when i go and look at the transaction using my iphone... i could see the time when the payment was made... i hope it would also show if it's paid in cash, card or check without clicking the invoice...
description is misleading. there is no way to enter or see expenses in this app and of course no way to attach receipt pictures to these expenses. you can enter expenses using computer and attach picture of receipt there, but not in this app. if you need a plug in to do that, why not to say so? or just remove missing components from description.
horrible service. this is the worst service.
simplifies. this app makes it really easy and fast to manage receipts and expenses.
great app. the app takes a bit to get used to but once you've played with it a bit it's very simple to navigate, update bank transactions and so on
only a trial. would have been nice to know it was a trial only, i saw the in app purchase option but no where did it say trial.
nothing works for me. nothing works for me with this app. if i login using desktop, qbo is ok but when i use the app, there is no information; no clients, no invoices, nothing. the subscription says i have a free trial until 2037. phone support was unsuccessful.
can't live without it. i don't know how i did business before this app. i love that i can access my company books anywhere. i love the way i can take a photo of the receipts for my expenses. thank you qb!
unusable.. i'm required by my work to use this appwebsite, and it is completely unusable. after confirming my account via email and twice by text message i get an error message when i try to login. the website also does not function no matter what browser i use on my phone. what a joke.
. the quickbooks app has saved so much time from my life! i can send invoices while i'm traveling, see how my business is doing in a few taps, and save receipts so i don't have to keep them in a file! many more features besides these. i love it!
makes life easy. great app that makes accounting on the fly so simple.
gerald. tax . tax here applied is actually confusing as only sales tax is taken into account. it's as if purchases or expenses are not taxed. if you need to claim tax on purchases or expenses doesn't show anything. it's as if i do it manually or. how do i import quickbook intuit into quickbooks online. or why not merge some features in intuit to online. it's not only as you say to do invoice as you go but you can't account for your taxes.
wow! loving the switch!. it's more than i had ever expected. using square or other solutions or good old fashion checks in the mail are nothing compared to how seamless qbo has made my life. that mac app, ipad app, iphone app and even the apple watch app give me the pulse on our company that i've needed for so long. can't wait to grow into more solutions with qbo!
on line program is great, but the app is limited.. intuit is great and well worth the money. but the app is worthless. there is little you can do. you should be able to do everything you can do on a desktop, otherwise what is the point? sad, but i would still recommend the on line program, just know you won't be using the app for any real accounting.
another quickbooks app. it gets super frustrating that you guys keep making us download a new app so you can start your reviews over. now your new app doesn’t recognize my account i have to sign in and out multiple times for it to actually load my data
great. easy to take a payment while out at work. and they are all ways updating and improving. very good. highly recommended
horrible. i cant log in just says all the times error error error very bad app
. great app for seeing your accounts and any overdue payments. i only use for reference because i put all my input on the quick books on the computer
. using a samsung note edge: cannot update estimates at all. been using this app for months and it constantly locks up and crashes. in response to the developer: it seems i have to reinstall it every day just to get it work. i have been doing this fix for a long time and it still does not resolve the locking up or crashing problem.
not happy with this. i've used quickbooks for years and have several corporations that i handle on the program. i'm also computer literate and have been a quickbooks tester in the past i'm not happy that it took me a whole day to download and set up payroll and still haven't figured out how to print reports for my customers or check for that matter
good for on the go business#. great app for mobile business. lacks some of the functionality of desktop version. i like the way i can record every transaction on the go, even invoices and payments. i don't like the fact that you can run only one business per subscription. much to expensive to pay separate for subscriptions if you have more than one business.
. great app that allows you to run your business on the go!
excellent. does everything i need to do on the go which is great. don't always get time in a busy day to sit down and send invoices, but i can with this while i'm out.
. love the mileage and receipt feature.
quickbooks on the go. i'm rating this so it will stop asking me in the app every time i open it.
some quirks but overall a great app. love the ease of running the office portion of the business on the go. this app is very easy to use and manage your customers and your business.
useful. useful for capturing my daytoday personal spendings
thankful. i'm so thankful for quickbooks. i'm still learning a lot about it, but i don't think i would not survive without it. i started a small business 1 yr ago. i love the app! i'm always on the go and can access it from anywhere. highly recommended by us @ the hygienist helper, llc!
ipad trouble. i’ve been using the self employed app for almost two years. i had some issues with crossover between a new mac and my iphone. though a painful process, tech support eventually fixed it. now after downloading the app on ipad, the app won’t work on the ipad. says mobile access isn’t available. well what have i been doing on my phone for two years then?
multiple crashes. multiple crashes when trying to add expenses on the iphone.
. great app
. looks really good but not for me as i don't send enough invoices so not worth paying for. if i had more business and earnt more money then it would be perfect. but for someone who does cleaning a couple of times as a week not worth paying. shame there isn't a free version.
app crashes. everything was great until one day the app crashed. now crashes every time i open it. reinstalled and same issue. help????
very unstable!. downloaded the new version but the app consistently crashes just after login. real shoddy development and testing by intuit.
loving this app. it's able to do everything i need it to do. after searching for so long and going through so many sub par apps it was such a relief to find this one!
needs improvement. supplier side is useless, plz improve, thanks
. data always not updated. when try to update manually, it takes a very long time.
no bill?. come on, we can do all things with expense and nothing with bills? bills are the big part of our business expenses from our vendors. they are not even added to the total expense on the summary dashboard, how can we really tell how our business is doing when a big chunk of cost not appearing? please include the ability to enterviewedit bills asap.
app is not functional. the app is keep crushing on iphone xs max every time you i want to create new invoice. billion dollar company but cannot fix bugs for a few months already, its embarrassing.
good handy software. good handy software ... need accounts ledger and trail balance statement account according to indian standard
too many clicks for attachments. i keep track of all transactions by taking pictures of the receipt, checks, deposit receipts, and just about everything then attach them to the transaction. with the user interface rule of thumb of three clicks access to specific functions, attachments can take as many as five to six clicks to save a picture, which is very annoying and time consuming.
missing function. we need a mileage tracking function in this app, not only to selfemployed version, to integrate all the expenses within quickbooks.
really helpful!!. i am a computer engineer and being able to make estimates and invoices in the field has really helped me!
app needs major work. the app is useless, i have to pull out my laptop or wait till i get to my home or office. i would love to use my ipad pro, that i carry everywhere but the app is literally useless!!! please fix asap
estimate layout. i like the way the app works, i have problems when i need to include a lot of info on the estimates. when i send it it leaves the first page blank and cuts of some of the info on the second page. overall great though!
user friendly. this app is simple to use, easy to grasp, and professional in presentation.
quickbooks. excellent software. easy to use both at home and on the go with mobile device.
stopped working on samsung galaxy s6. never had a problem with the app till about 3 weeks ago. it stopped working on my samsung galaxy s6 for no reason. i'm a small business that's on the road a lot and need to be able to send invoices on the spot. please fix it.
. useful
. still new but love the invoicing but accounts payable is hard to manage from mobile phone
. your app is garbage. i've had to reset my password 4 times and have the verification code texted and phoned to me several times and still nothing. thanks for wasting 1 hour of my time that i cannot get back😠😠😠😠😠
. great small business app
terrible. this app has so many problems. it will freeze up and the only way to fix it is to delete he app and download it again. i wii ok old not recommend.
. awesome app
not reliable. app logged you out while you’re still driving or doesn’t log you when you need it to. this used to be a great app but then this glitch happen with it not logging in and logging you out when you don’t want it to and when you contact customer service there’s no help other than delete the app and redownload it relogin yeah that doesn’t work.
background usage accounts for 50 percent of battery life. this app completely drains my battery. i thought my battery was broken and was about to replace it, but apple tech report suggested i check on battery usage by app and i discovered quickbooks was the culprit.
. great app for managing a small business!
lies. absolute lies  “run your entire business”?! give me a break  they’ve completely left out the employees payroll features and it doesn’t work when you login from an ios browser. typical qbo wasting my time and money
every small business needs this. you have no idea how this app boosted our mobile productivity, billing and cashflow efficiency. we are a family blue collar business, no one here loves paperwork, we love our phones and vehicles though and quickbooks online allows us spend very little time at the office and more time doing things we actually charge $$$ for doing.
crashes. crashes instantly please fix asap
. does basic accounting. cool. i paid money for this. clunky interface. settings buried in random locations. this is a professional product?
excellent. does what it says on the tin.. excellent app. works brilliantly on the ipad, sometimes find it a little sluggish on the iphone but i put that down to the poor wifi we sometimes have and bad signal from phone operator. anyways it's so easy to use and i can produce an invoice there and then and email to the client instantly. don't know why i took so long to move from desktop to quickbooks online.
very disappointed. there is very little you can actually do with the app.. not impressed am canceling the account.
app is glitching. ever since the new update to the quickbooks mobile app, it has been glitching every time i try to open the app. every time i click the app it closes by itself. it's frustrating whenever i have to log anything in the app. i have to constantly delete the app and reinstall it for it to work properly again.
great app. this app helps tremendously! great work and thank you for making book keeping so simple.
best app ever. just wanted to thank the development team for helping me to manage my business easier with this app.
excellent app. keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
. app crashes after login. reinstalled and still the same error. android using pixel 3. super annoying
. great program!! very easy to use and has many options.
great program. i love quickbooks. i run payroll and create estimates, invoices and sales receipts. i am able to link all my accounts even my square account easily and seamlessly. the customer service representatives are competent and friendly.
worst customer service. i love the idea of the app but it’s too confusing i don’t get a lot of the options and customer service i barely understood anything was no help at all. i just simply needed the app to track incomeexpense and personal pay.
good app poor customer service. was trying to switch over my account settings and the representative i had helping me seemed very lost and wasn’t of any help. still confused on how to swap my account to a different package and receive refunds on duplicate charges. really quite frustrated. besides that the app itself provides the services i need.
. quickbooks have never let me down. this app is great to manage my business.
great so far!. i am really glad we went with quickbooks online, as i love this app! being able to pull up any and all financial information as well as build and email estimates and invoices on the go is crucial to our business! thank you intuit!
more of a headache than a help. registered online, used same login info for the app, and the app says it's a free trial. online service not communicating well with app and i was hoping to use the app most of the time. sigh.
effective app for accounting.. yes.
great app! but quickly falling behind the ios version. our business purchased nexus 7 4g as it is much more cost effective and portable than an ipad mini. i recently looked at the ios capabilities in accessing my quickbooks data, i was very surprised to see so many more options. signature capture. scan a credit card from within the app etc etc. all of these feature are not on the android version but on ios. :(
great app. easy to use and very intuitive...
business handled from my phone. works well, update is even better. can create invoices, print, email, track and reconcile business spending. shows if invoices have been sent ( when emailing) as well as read. would give 5 stars if i were able to record bank deposits with this app. currently customer payments remain in undeposited funds until i log in to the desktop site. also wish i could save time by printing batch invoices. overall very useful, easy way to handle business on the go.
. makes my job so much easier
used to work. this last update has my app crashing and signing me out almost every time i use it. usually this is fixed quickly but it’s been a while now. please update the app so it’s doesn’t crash on the iphone x
easy to learn. easy to learn good support. i would like to be able to upload invoices sitting in my iphone pdf or ibooks app, or even better, directly from my email attachments, into the qb app when i am entering expenses. currently i only have the option of entering a photo. best wishes, dee
zero stars. another worthless update. now you have to login every freakin time i set my phone down and of course invoicing a customer with a credit still doesn't synchronize correctly and has never. if you're looking for an accounting system please shop around before getting tangled up in this company. i've been waiting for that call from tech support for 5 years lololol. why do you keep trying to fix what isn't broken. 21517 latest updates are a constant crash.
terrible billing system. i had an email offer for 75% off, tried to get it on my desktop. ended up subscribing for $10mth only to find out it closed my trial account, created a new account, now i have to cancel,subscribe on the ipad for $25mth and my data is not updating now....run away from this fast....
great!!. works so well. love how easy it is to use, love how seamless the app works as well as the computer version. so easy to send invoices via email. was so happy when i found out easy it is to use!
it's not signing in. it says error all the time... pls help me on this
great app. accounting on the go!. ahh my favorite part of the day just got a whole lot easier. this app lets you track you individual transactions on the fly. it also lets you categorize and itemize expenses. if you like neat books and your on your phone a lot this app makes things easy. it's free so just try it out.
quick books. this is very easy to use and it's great. with my iphone, ipad and mac, it updates any changes made and works great. thanks it is made invoicing easy
"dissapointed. i was hoping for more. if the app has issues logging into a bank account, ect. it gives you an error code that you have to log onto there website to walk you through what it ""might"" be, then you have to go back and forth, try different things to fix it....ahhhh. you get my point😒"
. so far so good; this app should provide a snapshot of the company as first view.
. great app
simple. très facile à utiliser
. can't get any email response from quickbooks. bad customer service. i want to download my account transactions but no reply from quickbooks.
excellent. first time setting up a new business and first time i've used book keeping software. you can do so much with just this app  it's incredibly intuitive and so easy to use. stops me being afraid of the numbers side of my business and just lets me get on with work! absolute game changer. love it.
. makes my life a lot easier... if i could only use this app while not driving down the interstate.. so what, who cares if grandma gets run over by a reindeer, i gotta get paid today..
quickbooks. quickbooks has been absolutely amazing overall. main issue is customer service and their ability to provide customer support for the app. i was required to ph 3 different numbers, one being out of service. once i finally spoke to csr he was extremely friendly but did state they haven’t been provided proper training to assist with app related issues but would do his best to help. i would upgrade to 4 or 5 stars if they provide a user friendly option for support.
. this has to be the worst app going zero customer support constantly lied too been trying for 3 weeks to send an invoice and they don't care as long as you keep paying absolute rip off...not far from being a scam spoke to managers about problems and still nothing done do don't waste your time or money...try any other program or stick to pen and paper far better and less stressful
"a great tool for accountants. this online version for my phone & ipad has come in so handy to check client info on the go...as well as categorize waiting transactions while i am out and about. i still use the qbo version on my laptop for ""major"" work. but being able to see things while i am out of the office is super helpful!!"
great app. allows me to invoice on the fly. easy to get things done. i don’t have to be home to do them.
a pretty good app. all in all, this is a pretty great app. it does just about everything i need it to while on the go, but it is missing one key piece of functionality. it does not allow the recording of deposits and that is really important for me. other than that it functions flawlessly and has never given me any trouble. overall, i love it!
quickbooks made simple. though i'm still not totally familiar with qb in general the app definitely makes it much easier and convenient to use and track accounts activity etc.
very good. one of the best way to do estimate and invoices highly recommended
. app doesn't load any files. great app if you like watching it think forever.
. the online version and mobile app helps me stay uptodate vs. the desktop version i previously used. i love it!
. is this app for jewellers?
great efficient and cost effective. this app is great and accounting system is too. best value for the money and easy to use.
should have been ready for io13. i waited patiently while running the io13 beta & this app not working. but now that the official io13 public release is available i have to give this 1 star, 0 if i could. the app just crashes!! quickbooks, you should have had your app ready way before this public release.
easy, powerful, and convenient. easy, powerful, and convenient
features bugged and gets worse every time they update it. transactions page on ios 13 doesn’t respond atall, you can categorise and transactions or match payments. stop updating the app when you haven’t tested it thoroughly... it’s getting to the point i’m going to start looking elsewhere.
. this app is the biggest piece of shut app i've ever used invoice asap is 10 times better yes it will connect with quick books but quick books on this app particularly online sucks dick i would rather have a disc version on my computer then online version whom ever came up with this version should have their hands chopped off
. a great awesome business app lets you control your finances and send off invoices
. i dont see why the mobile version doesnt sync with the desktop version. so if you bought thr desktop version, you can log in on your moblie device to send quotes or upload expenses on the go. then when you get back to the desktop its already there. seems stupid to charge extra and they dont sync together.
love it!. took me a while to get confident using it as i was used to doing things manually but now i love it. and especially love the app. don't know how i managed before!
worked awesome until latest update. just says error every time i log in. worked great before update however.
invoices don’t look great. the issue i had when using quickbooks was the invoices just didn’t look very polished or professional. there’s a way of setting up a custom invoice, but really you want a good default so you don’t have to muck around.
. great program. easy to use. payments made in the field, no more waiting for money. 2 thumbs up
good presentation. the app does not provide the option of tds in invoice which is provided in pc browser. so a star less from me
fab. brilliant app that updates instantly, giving a visual handle on your business at any time. thank you
. zero! the app says it needs to update, then brings me to a screen giving a choice of uninstall or open. if i choose open, i'm back to the need to update. if i uninstall and reinstall, that's just more steps before i'm back to the same useless place. garbage software. update: this was a problem they had seen and were working on. they fixed it and informed me of the fix a few hours later. working now.
app crashes constantly. i used to love this app. the last couple of months the app crashes daily and multiple times. i’m in the middle of working and the app says critical updates are needed and logs me out. i’m extremely frustrated with this considering i pay over $20month to use this software across all my devices. no resolution or contact from customer service. it happens almost weekly. what a nightmare. looking for alternatives.
amazing app when it works. haven’t been able to use this app as of late because i use a password manager and the quickbooks app stopped allowing me to paste my password into the password field at login. tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, still didn’t work. this issue has to be fixed.
. preparing to start a business and this software was rated the best. i took a 5 day class for 4hours. i was so happy that i downloaded this app and used in class too.
. great app that makes accounting easy on the go! it's flexible and terrific for our business!
. you will get no help from customer service. called 3 times. not one person could help me. i get error code 132.100. they didn't even know what it is. the answer they gave me is open it in desktop mode on my phone and use it from the browser. what is the point of having the app? i really like paying for software that i can't use. i will switch to freshbooks today 42819
great app. great app links well details on the laptop. can create invoices on as soon as the job is finished.
great app. so easy a caveman can do it
. helpful app. makes doing my books a lot quicker and more simple.
. tells me i have an update but will not give me the option to update and will not let me log on
good, getting better. not all of the functionality that i want but features are being added. very useful for seeing what's happening.
quickbooks online for the ipad. it works great!! anywhere at anytime. create your customers, create the estimate and then bill it out!! if your smart you will setup the direct payment to your bank account too!!
user friendly. this app is so nice when i am out and about getting good items for our business i can input them right then and there. i don't have to come home a do it, sometimes i forget then i get unorganized and have missing receipts that i later find. i love this app.
el programa es bueno. lo malo que a los hispanos nos afecta que no esté en español, aparte de eso por vivir en usa que el software este en español y de la opción de imprimir en inglés los documentos. sería más que genial
waste of time and slow. i didn’t even get past the registration. the app was soo slow and laggy when i was trying to put my details in i gave up. couldn’t imagine the amount of time i’d waste trying to write up quotes or invoices on it. avoid!!!
. disappointed trying to set up for a new business and linking bank account. keeps telling me something has gone wrong. after phoning up still no help. tried on 2 different devices and uninstalled loads of times. not happy. 🙈😥
. this is a easy to use app and makes keeping track of finances easy i'm still having no problems using quickbooks and it just gets easier and easier . and if you need help the team is there , i recommend this especially if you have no real experience u swing an accounting system
keep crashing. after last update keep crashing. doesn’t launch the app please fix asap
. used to work perfect ever since update it's very unreliable. can't log into app reliably. it often locks me out right when i'm standing in a customer's house trying to invoice them or locks me out when i need to go through my client list for a phone number etc. i suggest you consider competitors software until the app becomes stable again.
please prioritise. can you please forget about the fancy fonts and new colours!! first repair the many bugs and crucial features missing from this app so we can operate our business efficiently. once that’s done feel free to change as many fonts as you like.
easy to use, innovative and mobile friendly. we have been using qb at australiance.com for almost a year and i would not go back to my previous accounting software. the interface with paypal works well and save heaps of time for our online sales. it s easy to create expenses (e.g. business lunches etc), quotes or invoices on the go with the app + always know your bank account position as it interfaces directly with it.
amazing. great app and really easy to use. no need to wait to be at the office to do any transaction, all done easy and simple right on the spot!!!!!!!
login. i am not able to login.
new version problems. ever since the last update, i can no longer categorize and add income and expense from the app. it seems the buttons to “add” do not work.
"soooo slow. i have been using this app for about three years , and it was very functional and useful, but now, almost every time i open it, it says ""downloading data,"" and stays there... for 35 minutes doesnt matter whether my phone is on wifi or cell coverage. i hope they fix this bug."
. overall a great app. wish quoted were an option on the dashboard rather than accessing them from invoices then customers.
. fast and efficient. but some delays from computer to app.
. malfunctions on every level. did not attach a single receipt picture to the transaction. brought in the bank accounts and scrambled them. even on the desktop deposits are expenses and you cannot edit them
good app. great app easy to use
. this is not an free app. and they say it's not free after you submit all you information including phone number for verification. if they say its not free before i submit the info, i might think over and probably purchase....
won't install.. all i get is an error message.
nice app... wish it did all i need it to do. i have told people, do not buy an ipad with the intention of running qbo on it, you will be surely disappointed! the app doesn’t do enough, especially in reports and you can’t run payroll... and in the browser it’s terrible.
almost there. the developers are working hard at making this the best accounting package for smes. especially ones whose top management actively participates in reviewing reports. great for compact companies. great for hands on ceos. please check other reviews for page organisations and their experience.
outstanding app!. owning a small business has enough headaches as it is. with quickbooks, estimating and invoicing projects and services couldn't be easier! everything is streamline! here's a look inside my day to day as a landscaper using quickbooks: initial client meeting> estimate delivered before i leave the property.. bam! they call back that night or the next day and we have the job. after we finish the project, turn that estimate into an invoice on site.. bam! paid! $$ in the bank!
solid product. it's not the desktop version and you will notice features missing that you would normally find on the desktop. nevertheless, this is a great product. it allows me to invoice and communicate with customers in the field. thank you quickbooks team.
. excellent app i can do all my business on this
amazing. this app makes my business. hats off to the developer
brilliant. brilliant app. so happy that i've migrated over to quick books.
excellent. quickbooks online has created a whole new dimension to bookkeeping and accounting for small business. the ipad app is very useful for an overview of transactions
. good app!
makes it all the easier. program runs excellent always active on me note 3 a couple of things id love to see added. purchase orders and file attachments to invoices this would perfect it for me.
. often doesn't work. customer service tells me not to use the app, to access account from web browser. the numbers you get there may be undependable. don't trust it.
excellent app. keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
. great accounting app
. so, right up front, why not disclose the cost for the app after the 30day addiction period?🙄 google pixel 2 xl.
. quick, simple, much less hassle than the old way of doing things.
very useful mobile app. i don't expect my mobile version (android) to replace my desktop version. for checking customer balances, emailing invoices, and receiving payments it's a perfectly useful app. quick and easy access to invoices, customer balances, expenses, customer info, p&l and balance sheet. i'm not running or expecting more sophisticated reports from my phone! works great for what i need!
options. i need to be able to send quotes, not estimates.
. great app a bit overwhelming at first with all the features.
terrible billing system. i had an email offer for 75% off, tried to get it on my desktop. ended up subscribing for $10mth only to find out it closed my trial account, created a new account, now i have to cancel,subscribe on the ipad for $25mth and my data is not updating now....run away from this fast....
. awesome app
not worth the effort. absolutely horrible experience. we had qb before so now we have two accounts and they are interfering with one another. sat on hold forever and finally got instructions to cancel the oldest acct. went through all the instructions to where i’m suppose to select cancel or cancel trial and that option isn’t even a choice.
. amazing app
great work!. the app works great and is a very useful tool for on the go business matters. i have not yet figured out how to add single time activities on the app ... not sure this feature is available. but other then that it's great!
. excellent just sometimes login doesnt register
qb review.. great program. not able to print checks from app or change the total without adding all the line items amounts. i.e. estimates with multiple amounts as different options on the same estimate.
need help. i have problem with the data sync status. it written unable to get data. i can't even sent this message to your contact.
👌🏼. not a bad app
. nice app, would be 5stars but seem unable to wages
great app. the app takes a bit to get used to but once you've played with it a bit it's very simple to navigate, update bank transactions and so on
not happy. when i first got the app i fell in love i had problems with the desktop version , with the bank option on the online version which you removed i was able to log in my transactions very quickly , i would appreciate it if you would please bring back the bank option in the menu asap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
great for my small business. getting used to generating invoices and managing the books. perfect for me.
good app. helps me keep my books up to date.
. keep having to login which is annoying. very slow in general. app doesnt update automatically. i have to manually update which takes forever for a relatively small number of changes to be downloaded. after 3 years, still quite disappointed with it.
didn't work on my phone. doesn't set up on galaxy s7
good app. it is very useful app. it does most everything i need it to do when on a job site. invoicing is a snap. it would be excellent if productservices would auto populate as typed rather than scrolling through a drop down list.
great app, slow to make revisions. app works good 98% of the time, there are some things that i would change and they do not seem to be changing them
. recent updates have greatly improved this app! it used to be hard to switch back to it if you opened another app, but that's now fixed. i love being able to invoice customers right away, record an expense (along with a photo of the receipt) and take a payment.
. great app, simple to use ... a business can't move past a certain point without a reliable payment and invoice tracking system .... quick books delivers and is constantly improving ... highly recommended!!
featureless. i was a long time quickbooks pro desktop application user and switched to the online version this year. i'm disappointed by the snails pace of the development on this app. payroll is nonexistent and is not even on their radar. i think this could be a good app in the future but right now it is the bare minimum. (edited: the reply below is not available in canada)
love quickbooks and intuit. makes my job and my life so much easier. thank you quickbooks
great app. love this app. it makes running my business easier.
app is handy, but buggy. recurring invoices are a wreck. i have had the same issue for 2 years with quickbooks resetting my settings every month and automatically sending invoices to my clients without approval.
switching between account requires logout and login. so annoying, especially since there is no support for touch id. why can't you let us switch from within the app?
fantastic app. as a contractor to be in the field instantly give my customers and estimate or full fullblown bid and be able to follow up with change orders and billing all in one spot. very convenient easy to use and it works great on my phone , home computer, or ipad all at the same time. highly recommend this product not had one problem with it to date.
. very easy to maintain my account
almost there. the developers are working hard at making this the best accounting package for smes. especially ones whose top management actively participates in reviewing reports. great for compact companies. great for hands on ceos. please check other reviews for page organisations and their experience.
no employee support. this app doesn't allow you to do anything unless your account is the owner of the books you are looking at. i was added to the subscription but upon logging into the app was told i had no subscriptions. also unable to use my browser as mobile support doesn't exist for the website and they take it a step further by detecting you are using a phone a blocking you from a non mobile version of the site. very disappointing.
. problems sending invoices. update to customers from ipad doesn't always work. other issues. still a good app.
update needed asap. i also have been using this app for years (it’s great when working properly) but something happened after this last update and i’m getting kicked off and signed out in the middle of my invoices and estimates. it’s staying “an important update is required” or something like that and i’ll go to update the app but it’s already updated! and i’ll log back into the app and get kicked off again with the same message.....
. like others have stated, this was a great app until the last update. after a few tweaks the app is up & running fine now. every so often it will ask for me to log on again even though i just used it. other than that it works fine.
great app!. this app makes it so much easier to manage your quickbooks online account from the road or the office or anywhere!
excellent. great app and program.
easy, convenient. make offsite transactions quick and easy.
. doesn't give the full qbo experience, if it is it's not the same ui
poor implementation. need more of desktop features and views.. poor implementation. need more of desktop features and views. can't print packing slips. needs a simple overview page.
quickbooks online keeps me up to date. i am able to get my business information at my fingertips. i can copy receipts and invoice customers in 2 clicks. fast and simple!
. good app does great now that you can do more with it!
poor quality. poor quality. inconsistent design. loads of bugs. none of the bank feed transaction reconciliationapproval features have worked for at least the last three app updates. expensive rubbish.
very disappointed. i'm very disappointed because i have been unable to login on with my iphone or macbook pro. i tried to get help through customer service but all i got was a link. very disappointed!!
👍. very good app, i'm so happy with it!!
nice on the go. great way to keep up with business on the go. makes it nice and easy to get information for decision making while away. simple to use
great but they got you. great for the most part but they have you and they know it. every. single . year you can count on a hefty price increase. it never stays the same or goes down just always a nice increase. and they make it hard to leave as the export is virtually useless. i'm stuck with them.
. it doesn't load new transactions to review ever, even if you're days behind. kinda pointless unless you're trying to just use it for previous reports.
can't save invoices. invoices can't be saved on iphone.
quickbooks. great app for on the go
won't save receipts. try to record receipts in expenses, just get error message. called the number the message had, person they don't offer support for mobile devices or their app.**** update i did as you requested the day you requested and to date have not heard back from your staff. same issue with samsung 10.1 tablet and s6 phone.
such an awesome time saving app. this app saves so much time and effort for small business owners and probably business owners in general. would highly recommend.
graham. great app very easy to use for a mobile business. just need mobile wifi.
. so far it's been a good app. admittedly the pc version is better and slightly more user friendly but it does seem to be updates regularly and is getting better all the time.
very confusing. i will try as long as my patience lasts, maybe it will crack it better
quickbooks online. i really like the app, but it is very pricey.
. payment to vendors are shown as expense
disappointing. i've been a longtime user of the desktop version of quickbooks for the past 20 years and just recently switched to quickbooks online. i was really looking forward to managing my company's expenses, print checks, and enter bills from my new ipad. i am terribly disappointed in the complete lack of features available in this app. it's actually completely useless and a waste of memory. how could intuit release such a piece of garbage such as this?
user friendly. it's user friendly and i can access everything i need wherever i have internet access.
super easy. great app and accounts program  easy to use after a small amount of training. so far i haven’t come across any of those annoying bugs you get in other accounts apps
more features like desktop version!. needs to be further refined to include functions and features like submitting statements. simple stuff that just isn’t possible on the app version.
. this app sucks! i can't even login
crashes w ios 9. app crashes after you enter password. intuit has had 3 months to test on beta. customer service has no idea what ios 9 is.
. newest update (android nougat, galaxy s7) when creating an invoice or estimate, upon saving it just hangs. because it hangs, you try to back out. when trying to back out it asks if you want to save changes, you can select no, only to discover that your ten attempts to save did in fact create ten invoices. specifically the component that should after a save, take you out of invoice editing to look at the invoice is not operating correctly.
. they did a great job on this app. it's easy to use and i'm able to do all of my invoicing on my phone or tablet.
convenient access to financial information. we recently switched over from the desktop version of qb and have found the app to be a convenient way to view financial statements. i also really like the ability to take pictures of receipts and attach them to expenses from my mobile phone.
quickbooks saves me time & money. this app has streamlined my business as i am always on the go. its easy, efficient and powerful!
o melhor!. excelente!!! minha ferramenta de gestão financeira.
. very handy for a lanscaper on the go. now i can email invoices as soon as we are finished right from my smartphone, wether i'm standing next to the customer or in the truck. makes my life easier
great app. easy easy for an accounting knucklehead like me. just give my acct the password for taxes and keep going. love it
simple, quick, the best!. simple, quick, the best!
great app. it seems to work great! other then it not auto saving when i close the app, that is the only complaint i would have. everything else is awesome!
owner and operator of cool rush inc inc. this app has helped me to manage my business keep track of my account receivable keep track of my spending this is the best app i ever had
. love this app, it has come a long way. thank you quickbooks for making life easier.
cannot reconcile bank accounts on app. cannot reconcile on the app. completely useless to me as the bookkeeper.
crashes since update. i've tried to create a twoline invoice repeatedly since the update, and it crashes every time. will update review when it works.
. was unable to add transactions today
unable to log in. i have used quickbooks at office and decided to get it for my self but after downloading app it keeps giving me an error when i try to log in to the app. very unfortunate...i really like quickbooks
too slow. too slow, freezes, doesn't show if the email has been sent and other things... quick sale is way better.
very user easy. this app is great. very user friendly!
. just started using this app and so far i really like it.
tremendous. great app been using quickbooks over the years on desktop version specially go on mobile is the best way to go there is a couple tweaks that need to be worked on for example keeping track of inventory etc. and so forth been using quickbooks pro help ticket update these features as quickbooks from other than that it's a starter
. the app isnt bad, but what is bad? quickbooks itself.. 1st part of 2017 it cost 39.95 per month then went to 50.00 by the middle of 2017.. and today i get a charge of $60.00!!! they randomly keep going up on their prices without any warning or reason!
perfect for a small consulting firm. this app is everything i need for my consulting firm. easy to use and easy to keep track of expenses on the road. invoicing is a breeze. love the data in the cloud. take a pic and throw away those receipts! works flawlessly between my pc, mac, ipad and iphone. only gripe is the ipad & phone versions are not as similar as one would expect.
. very useful
horrible mobile support!. this app has a ton of problems and nobody at intuit cares to fix it. app won't load half the time, invoices do not show up, errors all the time, signature capture doesn't work, and no support available for the mobile app. the only thing they know is to tell you to uninstall and reinstall it which fixes nothing! if they don't get their issues fixed, i am switching!
great app. full functionality of desktop app, great for on the go business owners!
. i really like being able to do all my estimate and invoices on my mobile phone
. simple to navigate
. buggy, unusable basically.. can't create or edit an existing invoice.. keeps saying the terms not set and the dropdown for terms doesn't drop down with any options to select. other than being unusable, it's fine i guess.
. app no longer loads. error returned from client
good app but. it’s a good app but you should be able to mark invoices as paid and deposited via the app. my paid invoices are regularly, incorrectly shown as unpaid. i have to wait until i have time to go on my laptop and mark them as paid via the website
not good. it doesn't give access to all qb online features. i have to sign in online anyway. lots of error messages.
limited features in the app. the app has extremely limited features as compared to web cant send customer statements or edit recurring transactions or match partially paid invoices.
drafting estimates. when drafting estimates, system should auto save as many times hours of work is erased if you don’t constantly save before stepping away. in addition when you click the description box there should be an undo button in case it grabs all the text and it gets erased by pressing any button in accident. two very simple and logical things.
so far i love it. i was apprehensive at first. my son insisted i try it. he was right; it's actually easier on my phone than my pc.
really useful. great app allowing me to raise invoices whilst on site, confirm details with clients and syncs with the software back at the office.
great app!. this app saves me so much time! it lets me run my business much more efficiently! wouldn't be quite as successful without it. it also has very professional invoices and estimates
great when it works. i rely heavily on this especially the ability to email an invoice. lately i can't log in at all and when i do and try to send an email, all it does is give me a spinning wheel and then locks up. then i have to shut off the phone and restart.
can’t paste password. when i try to log in i can’t paste my 32 character password from the clipboard. this is a frequent frustration due to how often i have to log into the quickbooks app combined with my desire to use long, complex passwords that i store in a password safe. please fix this issue asap.
no register?. why would there be a quickbooks app without the main part......the register?
great applimited function. it is a great app. wish it had full functionality. payroll within the app. not a extra app. that only works. if you want ituit to handle everything. need to work like accessing from desktop. writing checks should also be there. plus running reports. but it is a great app. with limited function. has gotten better. just wish it was getting there faster.
. if i can navigate this app, anyone can! super easy and really professional. i'm loving it! i love the different reports as well. thank you!
. i use this for my startup business. the invoices help a lot!
. the customer service for quickbooks is ridiculous their merchant services handles your incoming payments and places holds on them with no notification until after banking day has closed and until after their business has closed. unless you are a multimilliondollar business i do not recommend using quickbooks for anything this was the biggest waste of money i have ever spent and is almost cost me to close my business.i would give you negative stars if i could you are the absolute worst platform .
no inventory tracking, no reminder. very disappointed with this no inventory tracking, no reminder for the app no not also for me its pointless quickbooks you better fix it i am cancelling my subscription
. i'm a small business owner and for me finding this app has been a blessing. this app really helps me manage my expenses as well as keep track of my inventory, employee payroll can be done as well etc. just really easy to use and having the profit and loss tracker is just awesome. so far i'm loving the free trial, definitely will subscribe once trail is over.
. they billed my account even though i ended my subscription and was told i would not be billed!!! 😡😠
does what i need. app is easy to navigate and has all functionality i am looking for.
signed out automatically. every time i launch the app it signs me out and i have to log in over and over. please fix this issue. it is annoying.
doesn't work. app crashes on load and while logging in. pretty useless so far. :(
app does not support multicurrency. it’s 2018. apps have been around for quite a while now. if your qbo account has multiple currencies enabled, you can’t use this app for banking. seriously, wtf?
. am i the only one who realizes after a while the auto tracking mileages notification doesnt show at the top of the screen?... i think this app is a complete rip off... it doesnt track all mileages like it says... i think i want my refund back. how can i go bout doing just that?
. does everything i need....
brilliant mobile app. it has changed my life . i am able to do quotes in the run and save so much valuable time .
great app!¡. im always on the go and this app is great when invoiceestimate has to be sent immediately or when there is no computer access¡¡ highly recommended for biz on the go!!
really useful. great app allowing me to raise invoices whilst on site, confirm details with clients and syncs with the software back at the office.
amazing app!!!. this is the most powerful and helpful app to manage a company, it it easy and friendly!!
cannot edit suppliers at all with the ipad app. i think the title says it all. i started an invoice from a supplier, however i cannot continue it on the ipad. it is just impossible! it just cannot be done. so it is for that reason only i am giving it one star. on the computer it is great, the ipad app is useless.
. haven't been able to access my books since early september, can only use desktop app, browser and mobile app gives error message. contacted support 4+, engineers are working on known problem...10 weeks and counting
. absolutely horrible customer service having multiple issues but because they can't duplicate it they act as if it's not a problem i have to delete my app and reinstall just about every day now because it says there is suspicious activity when there isn't and on the samsung tablet the app will not let you do negative numbers for discounts
my everyday app. love how easy this app is to use
thanks qbo. i have upgrade to plus but my note3 can't review bills & purchase order. pls advise.
great ap. great switch to online and it works ok but crashes sometimes and is very slow need to make it so it works without internet when there isn’t service and backs it up when back in service. like when you go to a customers place that is where there isn’t service.
qbooks is a entrepreneur's dream. i've been doing bussines as general contractor the last 20 yrs, always i tried to find a software where i can handle all my administrative information at all (invoicing, payroll, expenses) with this apps you can get everything at your fingers reach, so you can control all money inout. it's a world marvel!
. as someone who is constantly on the go, i have minimal access to a desktop computer. this app makes it easy to invoice and record payments right from my phone whether i can make it to the office or not
works great. business on the go! i wish there where a few more options, but all in all great app.
tops. i've never used any accounting software or accounting apps in my life & can honestly say this is the best! if you type 55378008 into any xl column & turn your laptop upside down it spells..boobless! 😄
poor payroll and after service tech support.. been waiting months to try and sort it out. hours on the phone. not worth the energy anymore. looking at zero as a worthwhile option. regret being tricked into the cheap price. pay peanuts you get monkeys.
makes life easy. haven't worked through 100% of the app but as of right now it has made accounting world easier. especially keeping up to date with bank account reconciliation.
. user for 2 years, samsung s8, app fails to load now. when it did work, it never showed historical customer transactions. never properly refreshed bank connections oh, you would have to go to the online portal and update first before you could use or see your transactions on this app. i'm pretty fed up at this point with this app, only thing i really wanted to do at this point was use the receipt scanning but i can't even do that now. uninstalled..
. great app and easy to use
a whole new level of deluxe. this has taken our construction company to the next level. the reporting, receipt feature and ease of use has made it simple to track p and l of each job
. great app for mobile business
does not support multiple currencies. hope they can add multiple currencies soon. it's useless if you have a primary currency other than usd.
"error. i dont even understand why massage always popup said ""failed to connect with server"" when everytime tried to login using this app..send several of email to support team but theres no answer n solution..please do something i am a quickbooks online plus subscriber.."
great app. keeps me up to date with my rental properties. i always know where the finances are. makes the end of the month so quick and easy to finalize. it's fun.
amazing. it is a great app. so powerful i can do my full estimate and invoice and the best feature entering in my receipts for expenses and it's so easy!
great and helpful app!. very easy and lots of good components for business transactions. good job!
google signin never works. i have tried and tried to get into the quickbooks app using the google signin. i get it to work maybe 1 out of every 50 times i try to login. i don't know why they haven't fixed this issue yet. i always end up logging in on my mobile browser instead. fail
. lot of functionality easier than web or desktop app.
. quickbooks technical support is very bad and technical support dont know about how to customised form of bill and showing in their theam but donot show in my bill how to solve it thay don't know ..... and my network speed is 5mbps but opening quick books need time 10  20 minutes to open ... i don't recommend any one for supscription or purchase .... this is a overall very slow software
report must show sales receipts as well. reports must show sales receipts as well and not only invoices. qb allows you to generate sales receipts for customers who paid at the point of sale, hence the report functionality in the app must show these receipts as sales otherwise, the whole report is meaningless. also, more basic reports are needed such as p&l, balance sheet, suppliers, transactions....etc. thx anyway.
dcs lassalle inc. op manager. trucking and rigging company local and long distance
decent.. the program is regularly requiring me to update my accounts and will not auto update and refresh my bank accounts. not as user friendly as i thought it would be.
after 3 years qb stops working. spent hours on the phone with support. no solution. cannot add items to an invoice. i'm a distributor so mobile is pretty important. sorry qb pretty disappointed with your product.
. very usefull app
limited, no balances. it allows you to enter expenses and sales oriented transactions, but does not allow you to view account balances. right now it's of limited utility
zero stars new version is junk. i used this app several times a day. i run my business on this app. since april 10th i cannot access my data. my business is suffering and intuit cannot fix it. i still have to pay. tech support at intuit  quickbooks recommended i switch to a android. (i doesn't work on my iphone or ipad) i really do not want to invest in new hardware. stay away from intuit they do not care and offer no solutions.
. great app!
never even got it opened before it had an error. i have never had this in my life,my business barely has a name and it said an account already exists under my email address.. sounds like there are some issues to work out
. cannot cancel subscription been trying for over 2 hours i will have to go to bank and change all of my account numbers because of this plus redo all of my direct deposits and all of my auto pay bills ..do not fall for this app
quite decent. works well for me so far.
not free. wish there was an app like this for free the soon i started free trial next step was if i wanted 3months and pay or have a small discount and still pay :
junk.. not great. doesn't support photos. i guess thats to be expected from intuit. always a little behind the game. don't bother with support either they are worse. i have had my ipad cleared twice by their support. inventory and all. wonder why the go payments cant work like an invoicing system. talk about the blind leading the blind!
user friendly. come from using myob. quickbooks is easy to use, calculates gst, bas and invoices. highly recommend.
awesome software. i'm a creative and figures aren't my thing, and i find it a dream to use. i'm so glad my accountant recommended it. having your accounts in the cloud just makes the whole laborious process a snip!
. terrible customer service plinky plonky app. i have now moved everything over to xero which is much better
good, but.... we've been using quickbooks online since we started our small business, and we like it because it's easy to use and travels with you. that being said, however, you can't back up the data to your own computer. so if you make a major mistake, you can't go backwards  only reset the books. so if you choose cbo, make sure you print backup trial balances constantly!
user friendly. it's like working from a regular laptop or computer. sync is done immediately and i can do any transactions anywhere. i love it!
. great business app
. stop asking for feedback every 5mins when i try to get stuff done. what the hell is wrong with you people designing this feedback bullshit system?
good, but too limited.. as others have posted, this app would be infinitely more useful if it had more of the functionality of the desktop browser based system. being mobile means i can't do many if the things i'd like to.
. still waiting on a transaction from last week. was told a lie.
does not compare to ipad version.. i am an android man all the way but very dissatisfied with quickbooks online for android. i purchased quickbooks online after seeing it on a friends ipad. i was disappointed to find that it looked nothing like my friends version. the layout on android in comparison looked very primitive and unintuitive. it does not even capture signatures like the ipad version.
. is a great app
. this app stinks. no features. nothing
. easy to use, easy to keep your invoices accurate, costumers like it
. great app. it has been essential to the daily operation of my business. thanks quickbooks
. this programapp has paralyzed me from carrying out business transactions and estimations due to a failure in the app being able to sync my data for 3 days now, customer support is next to nothing when day after day they told me i will receive an email once the issue is resolved. i am losing money and this does not seem to be a priority for quickbooks.
credit card interface is awesome. i know all apps aren't perfect, but this one does everything i need. i'm so happy when i can set up a new client, invoice and receive payment immediately! this has really improved my cash flow!
. does not work on my pixel phone. sucks i have to pay the same rate as everyone else but can't get all the benefits. update...the email address intuit gave me to email does not work...shocker.
useless app. can’t issue a po, pull one up via search, properly send one, etc. core business function that they didn’t bother to include because intuit continues to have their head stuck in the sand.
. signed up 6 days ago for self employed package, although it says in the package i can use the app, when opening the app it states i have not signed up for it... emailed asking for help, no reply. scheduled a call back for tuesday 13pm, noone called. poor customer service. i will cancel and find another accountancy program.
complement to quickbooks online. this app is a complement to quickbooks online. this apple really work good for making estimates sending invoices and much more. i wish gopayment and quickbooks online were integrated or as one. other than that, great app.
made business that much easier. amazing, don’t know how i kept track of my business before quickbooks.
. great app wish there was more flexibility with customizing the sales reciepts
. signed up to app. no clear pricing. my invoice had vat numbers all over it but i'm not vat registered. seems impossible to take vat number off invoices. customer service very slow and hard to get though to. no tel number.
. this app is simple and really easy to use. makes my job way easier.
. great app
disaster. was forced to use qb online due to always changing fees for desktop version. always crashes. hard to use. terrible. wish i could use another program.
register showing wrong date. the register still shows the wrong dates. if i process a transaction on a tuesday, the register will show the transaction was processed on monday. when i click into the transaction, the correct date is reflected, but it still very annoying.
clean and wonderful app. we love qb for i pad.
great app. added immensely to efficiency of our business and interface with customers
app crashes constantly. i used to love this app. the last couple of months the app crashes daily and multiple times. i’m in the middle of working and the app says critical updates are needed and logs me out. i’m extremely frustrated with this considering i pay over $20month to use this software across all my devices. no resolution or contact from customer service. it happens almost weekly. what a nightmare. looking for alternatives.
handyman sam. i've been using qbo for a few years now for my handyman business. with the new updates to this app and their online version i have been very happy. i just enrolled in the credit card payment processing. it has been helpful to collect. the credit card swipe device is easy to use too. must have if you use quickbooks.
everything in one place!. i love the ease of use with this app! i was using invoice2go but with the features of this app, switching was a no brainer. rated it four stars only because i've been using it for only a month. otherwise i'd probably give it 5 stars, but we'll see!
love quickbooks. this is the best accounting software there is. quickbooks makes my life so much easier and running my business is so much smoother with the available accounting options!
search. the search feature needs improvement. can only search by customer info. can’t seem to search for an invoice by keywords that are in the invoice.
useful. very useful app create, edit, print and receive payments all in the go perfect for a business that move around
easy to use. with our business at the end of our fingertips, quickbooks provides the ease required to manage our income and expenses quickly and effortlessly. having used most of the other leading brands, we find this is the best by far!
great resource. a little tricky to manipulate at first. but now i love it.
. lovely app.
. there are many bugs and glitches. the ios version allows bank feed updates and this one doesn't!! still doesn't. still buggy.
. denver's is it possible to have a look at the attached file of my resume
". app for android stinks. only loads a few visible parts and if you try to update an invoice, originally entered on the desktop, it will ""zero out"" the parts not found on the app (causing invoicing discrepancies). ayou also can't upload attachments to invoices (which i use frequently in my business). until intuit can make their app consistent with the desktop version it is unusable for mobility."
useless out in the field can't work off line. useless out in the field can't work off line and constantly wants you to refresh data. does not support star portable printers. waist of space on cell phone gave it a second try useless creating a invoice have to use search window to find items. had to go use desktop instead of my ipad pro because would of took all night to do a invoice.
. great app, allows me to invoice electronically and mobile. it then updates automatically in system.
no support for canadian tax system. intuit's quickbooks for web does not support the canadian tax system. not sure why this app is appearing in the canadian app store.
horrible. had to get because of credit card swiper. ever since installed takes dozen times to save anything and same with login. anything to do with saving glitches constantly.
owner. great app to take of of business anywhere i'm at!
. user friendly
owner. love being able to have quickbooks on my phone and being able to send invoices and receive payments on the go. makes my job so much easier. app works great and is so simple that even my husband can figure it out :)
nice app that works well!!. works well, well thought out and presented. helps me day to day for sure!!
qb. use it for my farm. fantastic app
useless for sure. qbo is useless. can’t login with google account. forces me to create a newseparate password. can’t really access qbo via a browser on ipad. overall terrible experience. i’m sure it’s equally apple and qbo fault.
great for business. this is a great app to use for daily business
. terrible experience. app would regularly crash, bank accounts would continuously disconnect for no reason. frustrating and in no way time saving in the end.
. not easy to work with and cost. can't recommend.
quickbook online plus. it's alright. i hope u can work on the invoice template options to add: * individual discount% column for each input * additional description column * additional customized invoice number top rhs * ability to change currency on the invoice itself * add exchange rate manually
. great app. very helpful.
very pleased. very happy
love it!. qb is stunningly simple yet superbly sufficient to handle our business needs for invoicing clients, reporting ar and preparing us for yearend taxes. the mobil app is equally impressive!
would be great if…. this app would really be a great app if it woukd have all the functions as on the pc. for exsample i wanted to issue an invoice with a different currency, and the app blocked it and sent me to the pc. so for what is this app good if we have to go to the pc for almost each transaction?
. great app the only thing missing is the ability to enter a mileage report.
love it but..... seems like new technology with some bugs. also some reciprocity issues with what can be done on app as opposed to phone. i know intuit will refine and well worth it. it is helping me streamline my business networking system!!! love it and look forward to giving a 5 star in couple years!
not free. free trial that gathers all personal info then you can try it doesn't link to real program !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
so easy. this app makes it so easy to print invoices for my clients on the go! also cuts down on time that i have to sit at my desk at home and allows more time with family. great app.
quickbooks renew account??. renewed my subscription for a year and i'm still locked out, every time i log in it keeps telling me to subscribe for 1 month i tried to go that way and it asked if i wanted to change my current year subscription? makes no sense.. wish some (tech support or program owner) fixes it i'm about to cancel it all..... wy small business owner
cc payment signature window. love the app but, something was changed in one of the recent updates. the screen for the customer to sign to authorize cc payment was made into smaller window. every time you touch it to try and sign, it just moves the window up and down. you can barely make a single line. starting to get frustrating for customers and myself. please address this asap thanks!
good product. use this for small business. works good for all basic business functions. updates have made it even better. i enjoy and appreciate this product.
great resource. love the app capability and ease of use.
great app!. this app makes using accounting software extremely easy and convenient! so easy to go from phone, tablet, and pc.
doesn’t work on ios 13. so many bugs:  can’t send reminders  can’t modify invoices ( reaching invoice number limit?)  can’t send invoices( email is too long? )
. makes life much easier. just had to learn real accounting techniques. provided i can find a mobile signal then the mobile version is a great help.
. this app is horrible. why make something so bad? it needs a complete overhaul. i can't email receipts to an inbox, income transactions don't show gst amount like expenses, i can't view pdf receipts. it's just all round ugly and cumbersome and i've only used it for five minutes. i thought the xero app was bad but it's 5 stars compared to this trash. deleted.
. not supported android mobile in india. software means that either o mobile or computer should work equally both places, but your software has only web version then how to use your software.
tremendous. great app been using quickbooks over the years on desktop version specially go on mobile is the best way to go there is a couple tweaks that need to be worked on for example keeping track of inventory etc. and so forth been using quickbooks pro help ticket update these features as quickbooks from other than that it's a starter
easy to use and great for tracking transactions. navigation is straightforward and the software updates quickly
bs. imported a csv for earlier history than the standard import, as the instructions said to, only to find nothing in the record anywhere, again. yes, i spent a few hours, imported lots of transactions, got nothing, twice. screw these people.
. its a time saving tool. and it helps to keep things in order and simple.
easy and super user friendly. first time user of this type of app but it was easy to set up. sent out my first invoice after 1hr already.
not happy. when i first got the app i fell in love i had problems with the desktop version , with the bank option on the online version which you removed i was able to log in my transactions very quickly , i would appreciate it if you would please bring back the bank option in the menu asap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
a good idea but not very useful yet. there is not access to the important online reports. there is no access to fx transactions or accounts in a foreign currency. i live overseas and bill my clients in us dollars and as such have no access to client information or us dollars sales and accounts. if the app mirrored the online program it would be great but it doesnt!!
mileage tracking not working. the app works well except for mileage tracking
. absolute garbage...they will not email my paystubs to my people
seriously easy software. great app for a great product!
great app easy to use. this new version does almost everything online with my smart phone. i can match transactions, add expenses, do almost everything i need to do while on the road. thank you intuit!
. app will not connect. says experiencing technical difficulties. this has been happening for a week.
not pleased. for one i still can't redownload the app after i accidentally deleted it. it's been months. i hit the cloud button and it does nothing. i also put an estimate in and the phone didn't save it. when i checked desktop it was saved 6x because i kept trying to do it on the phone. the app has many glitches but it is helpful when i'm not by a computer but u cannot rely solely on the app.
. good app, but please can you add mode of payment to sale receipts and receive payment. anytime i do sale receipt on the app, it post the cash directly to undeposited fund account i created instead of bank account of cash and cash equivalent that i created... please help us fix this pls
nice. nice app but when you have to select item then you have to type whole item code, before update you just type last 23 words and it's there.
great app. just started to use. easy to navigate. have had no issues.
poor functionality. constant crashes inability to complete selected tasks poor functionality this app try’s hard but doesn’t quiet make it with its functions. it didn’t at all shot me but that’s what the 3 day free trial is for. i wasn’t going to rate this app but after they charged me $10.50 for a 1 month subscription after i cancelled and deleted the app; i will rate it
purchased but won’t work.. i can not contact customer service to save my life!! i purchased this after my trial but it won’t acknowledge that i have. very upset and frustrated!!!
awesome job on the ipad app!. really needed this app for quickbooks to keep me mobile. i needed to use quickbooks online but was unable to use my ipad for quickbooks now i can! keep up with the tweaks but i love it!
easy, fast and efficient. this app keeps me organized and on top of my cash flow. it is easier to use than the web interface and it's always with me when i'm on the road. as a mobile trainer, this is invaluable. once customers and vendors are set up, it takes seconds to update invoices, payments, and receipts. highly recommend.
buggy. super buggy and currently unusable. fix your app qb. we pay good money for your service.
. takes care of everything for me makes life so much easier!
no purchase orders. as of feb 2015, i'm unable to find a way to create purchase orders from this app. without the ability to raise orders for inventory, i cannot run my business, so the app is useless for me. seems handy, so i wish it worked properly.
. great app
very happy with app. the app is very good, and provides a lot of useful information that can be sent anytime, anywhere.
great. great app does everything it says it will
best small business tool ever!. this has been the best business tool for my sole proprietorship. my accountant also loves it as she can prepare my taxes with ease. i couldn't have made it without quickbooks, or at least maintained my sanity.
. limited in what the app can do...
. being mainly a cis contractor it won't let me make invoices in app so have to use browser which doesn't work so have to wait till i get home to invoice from laptop. any chance of this being resolved
i can't put in negative numbers 😡. i'm trying to make a receipt for a client. i'm a property manager. i need to explain deductions i made but it will only add not subtract. it does both on the computer so i guess i'll use the computer for that.
now 5 stars. love it! have to have it! it made my life so much easier.
just couldn't create an account. not sure what the issue is but it keeps encountering some problems everytime i try to create an account. never got past that stage. so it's no use to me if i can't create an account to get started.
. nice program! make it so i can bank on droid and it couldn't get any better.
great!. new to the app, but so far it is great! especially when coming from doing everything manually with spreadsheets and boxes of receipts. much better than the qb for mac 2015 i tried.
. quickbooks has made it much easier to run my small business and create invoices on the go!
. so far i haven't enjoyed this app. you can't scan a receipt with details auto uploading but you can on the selfemployed version and also had no luck at uploading a file into an expense when manually loading details from a receipt.
makes my job easier. love it!
love it!!. my only reservation to giving it a five star is that i can't go between invoice formats on my mobile device. i would also say to the developers, keep working with it. it keeps getting better. thanks
. not for indian. can register as i am from india
. what i don't like about quick book is that when u use your phone to record a payment. you have to use the computer to move the cash from undeposited cash to cash in hand. but it is a good accounting software. and i love it
this app is awesome!. very easy to use and very helpful for my small business!
very good. does just what i need.
"no timesheets?. has no access to entering time or reviewing my employees time and expenses. entering and reviewing time and expenses are the only things i need on the go. it shows me summaries, but im never going to be away from my desk and all of a sudden need to check the ""big picture"""
please: give us delayed charge. for the love of gawd, why can i not add a delayed charge on the mobile app?????? this is something you actually want to do when you're at a client, not get them to sign for an invoice every time you visit them during the month.
not enough. can’t do everything from app. they say it’s better, but it can’t be if i can’t access everything i need, makes the app pointless.
. love this app.so simple to use. saves you so much time with your paperwork keep up the great work guys😀😀
fantastic software !. this has made my life a whole lot easier. invoice and estimates on the go. i really feel in control of my accounts.
. no unit field in invoice or estimation. makes it impractical in real life transactions.
. pc or macbook apps are good but i am sorry to say that this app is waste of time. very slow. page loading time is more that 1 min even with wifi having 100mb broadband speed.
a good portable quickbooks app. the app has most of the important features, is easy to use, and is certainly a better option than trying to use the quickbooks online on an iphone. it is not a complete substitute as there are several features not available on the app,but it does allow recording time and expenses while on the road and even allows checking on and updating bank balances.
quickbooks app. organization, taxes and everything! quickbooks really helps you run a full business.
great app on the go. view invoices ,do invoices and bids on the go no need to wait until you get to your laptop or computer
qbo ipad & iphone. i think that intuit is doing an incredible job with this product! the updates have been wonderful for me. i would love to be able to make transfers between accounts, but i am thoroughly pleased with this product.
dreadful just unusable plus desktop version same. started well. then couldn’t input expenses on the app. hard and long winded to get support. now cant enter invoices and reciepts on desktop version!! totally pointless package and when you have r pugh troubles running your own business!!!!! think i will go back to my accountant and just dump everything with him each month as the hours this is costing me plus unbelievable stress!!!!
. very hard and confusing to use i was lead to believe it would be simple and easy but having spent hours going back and forward i think im going to cut my losses and stick to letting my accountant do it all
fantastic!!!. brilliant app. never even noticed the expenses bit so will have to fill this out for the year. absolutely brilliant. first class
good to keep on track. excellent app for inputting information immediately, but that's all it does.
easy to use but missing some features. it's a great app but missing some features. i need to see quantity for my products and be able to create purchase orders from vendors and receive inventory.
. waste of time, the app frequently crashed and doesn't have anywhere near the functionality of the web app.
simple, just plain works.... easy to set up, use and send invoices, receive payments and figure out the taxes.
suivi comptabilité. qbo est viral, on comprend ce que l'on fait et la plateforme est intuitive. autant plaisant sur ipad iphone chromebook ou safari, c'est compatible, pratique et efficace. permet le travail collaboratif en temps réel jusqu'à 5 personnes en même temps. wow
please fix me. ios 13 ijust upgrade cannot write items into invoices
. i just need it to do invoices with 2 taxes and it seems to work good
quick books online. ease of bookkeeping entries at home or on the go  i thereby circumvent hiring to data entry
not happy. doesnt let me connect my bank (santander) asks for a code that i dont know or my bank 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️ useless
. good app very good addition to qb online really convenient. no issues or problems so far and seems quite secure. simple to use
would recommend to everyone!. easily the best software to manage a small business. i am able to invoice customers with such ease that it makes me wonder why i haven't switched software platforms sooner! you can not go wrong with quickbooks. the app is so easy to navigate.
. only just started using this app, and i'm already in love.
no mileage tracking. false advertising. the mileage tracking screen shot is from the self employed app, not the small business app
app is good support is horrible. call qb for basic questions lady name amanda hang up on me.. dial back in the she place me on hold for 15 minutes
. app wont log in to my samsung phone, tried a number of different things including deleting data and cache as well as uninstallinstalling it. i know my account is fine because it works on my apple phonecomputer with no issues. please help!
. i like the feature improvements but it locks up and is so slow it is unusable.
everything worked great until last update.. can't save invoices. have to login every time using password. payments don't apply to the invoices just to name a few. wish i hadn't updated.
. very easy to use and saves products for quick invoices!
. love this app. just wish i could create work orders
good app and service. after the last update, i can’t create an invoice after i add a customer. it crashes every time on my ipad. it still works on my phone. please fix this issue.
perfect. awesome. best small biz app i've found.
. there should be a feature that allows you to send invoices to cell phones also other then just emails
. doesn't work. after logged in, i can seem to review my accounts. this would be a great app if they could fix this issue.
stuck in the test version. it is all great in theory, yet there are so many glitches. you can’t search by address. it crashes too often. frequent notifications that as an example your deposits weren’t recorded properly do you want to fix them? i shouldn’t need to fix the bank deposits. please fix the bugs! oh and not all of my clients made the transition from the desktop version to the online version. also quickbooks asked me to rate quickbooks online 4 times today alone.
great as an assistant to the desktop version.. i've found this app to be a great mobile partner to the full desktop (or online) version. there's a couple functions that aren't available in the app but everything you do need is easily available. i can't connect my bank account because my (non us) bank isn't listed but being able to input expenses as they happen is a great way of keeping updated accounts. reconciliation is a breeze afterwards. it's a great app.
love this app!. i have my own business and quick books makes my life a lot easier.
. the worst app in the entire google play store its useless dosent work correctly impossible to navigate the person who made it ought to be fired its a disgrace
very good app. in general very good app. missing key features like banking, updates etc.
makes life easier!!. quickbooks online, the app, and gopayment have all made my life so much easier. i can now track things in the go and accept payments right on my phone. it works seamlessly!
. this app not work in my phone .i am opening this the screen is black.i am purchased 1 year subscription in last two days back.
useless app for working in qbo. only found 2 reports available through the app. can’t “drill” into figures on the 2 reports provided. cannot access expenses on coa can’t really get any work done.
quick books app. this app is really good, can do nearly everything i need from the phone.
great app!. very userfriendly and convenient. great for people who are needing to create invoices and estimates and track expenses. the iphone app is fantastic!
simple and great on the go!. a simpler version of quick books online, not all the functions are available but it's very user friendly and does what i need!
quickbooks online rocks!. setting up qbonline to invoice, purchase, and banking downloads makes it possible to be completely mobile with your business!
tax preparation. i love quickbooks. qb has everything i need for my accountant at the end of the year. makes taxes soooooooo much easier 💗
can’t subscribe after trial period. it’s a good quickbooks version but i started trial period made a profile and invoices but the app won’t let me renew subscription the buy now button doesn’t work when clicked on. now i may have to start another profile and lose everything?
. so easy to use! i wish i had started to use this when i set up my business! it saves me so much time and i can enter transactions from my tablet which is so convenient. i also love the way it links (safely) to my bank account and automatically brings all my transactions into quickbooks. would strongly recommend!
terrible app. half the time i can not download my banking info, i can not do invoices. it’s junk for what you have to pay for it. i’m finding something new.
very user easy. this app is great. very user friendly!
electrician. this is app for business
. dont bother if you dont have access to pc or laptop.basic features like editing customer email is not available on mobile devices including tablets.if an invoice isnt sent because the recipient email address sends it back,you have no way of knowing that an error has occurred even when attempting to check via any web browser.caused me £1000's of cashflow headache. contacted customer support,got a nonsensical response.made it sound like the problem is an actual feature of the app and software.
. horrible experience continues with indian counterpart. asked for refund twice they have sent transaction confirmations details till date money not credited even after mailing bank details and statements. customer care and refunds are two seperate teams with no interaction. had asked for refund in early dec 2018 now it is jan 2019. sales person and customer care representatives have smartly disappeared leaving customer hanging high and dry without refund and empty promises.
amazing app for a small or medium business. very user friendly. don't have to be an account to enter data, app allows you to do everything on the go.
great software. great affordable option for small businesses. this software is incredibly helpful to ease the stress of being an entrepreneur.
qb app !!!. love the app ! now with the new update i can log in with touch id :))) how fan, and saving much time.
help and advise. i subscribe this on the trial and pop up the good deal 7.49 for 3 months and should be starting my payment for real is 14.99 in january. hey should be responsible for this ads. apple
useless for mobile access. doesn't have any of the features you would expect from a mobile app. if you want to do anything other than create a invoice or view transactions you put in from your desktop, its a waste of time. no balances, no accounts, nothing useful at all.
. thanks for the fix. i am revising review.
. frustrating. slow. pretty much only to be used for creating invoices and receiving payments. maybe reports. wanted something that functioned just like the online version but for my mobile. wanted to catch up on work at opportune moments without having to get the laptop out. would not recommend. client hates it.
jp. very good app for any business
worst ever app. i have no idea why is this app on app store. the moment i sign in it says your session is expired and you need it sign in again. thats the only vicious circle of time wastage is what this app has to offer its customer. worst experience ever
scam!. this app won’t let you unsubscribe. forgot my password and tried all ways to access my account, but they won’t send me a verification code in my phone. i have exhausted all efforts to change my password and log in, but to no success. i reached out to their failure of a customer service representative, didn’t help either! scam!
simple things just don’t work in this app.. now i can’t copy my password from my password safe into the quickbooks login. this means i will have to use a simple easy to use and less secure password. also, there is no way to enter check numbers into the bank transactions. this works fine on a mac and online but not in the ipad app. these simple problems make the ipad app almost useless.
got worse after the update. it shows the information of last week, it doesn't update
nightmare update. it was bad before the update. how could it be even worse now? unending refreshing bank data (constant spinning wheel) makes it virtually useless and beyond frustrating for reviewing and matching transactions on the iphone.
works and convenient. easy way to enter sales and expenses. i've had no problems with this app.
purchase order. i like the app it's a good app there is one screw up and a big one i wonder if it's only me who uses it why can't i make a purchase order on the app ??? other wise it's a great app
"qué pasa?. la aplicación simplemente dejo de funcionar. óptimo el icono, ""abre"" y se cierra de inmediato. desinstalarlo e instalé, y el problema continúa. solucionen, es una herramienta de trabajo!"
needs help. if you have multiple locations this app is useless cause you cannot assign a class to the expense.
great update to already great app. the latest update is great! being able to reconcile through app is awesome. best accounting app out!!!
. the app offers no simple means to cancel your account should you wish to do so. their help desk also seems eager to push you off on to other, equally unhelpful venues. they also informed me that once i manage to cancel my account (if even possible) they will continue to hold on to my personal information, defeating the point of cancelling an account.
owner. great app
. it's been awesome giving estimate 's on the fly.
. useful
easy!. it's great being able to pull up my info on the go
developors don’t use the program. it’s obvious that most ratereview apps start at 5 stars and work down instead of working at 3 which most people would consider average. given that i would say it’s a 3 at best since those that write the program don’t actually use it and like most developers use the customer as the guinea pigs.
qbo quickstart. i find it user friendly, reasonably easy to pick up and the ability to use it on my phone, ipad or pc is very useful.
. i love the app. i would like to see full functionality. that would allow for entries and time savings everywhere.
. lacking abundantly completely unprofessional, there's about 5 options, you can't even put together an invoice that you could realistically give to a customer. i'm very very disappointed.
. very slow to load and often locks up.
. for running my little business and sending invoices on the fly its great!
. works good but only when it works. i've gotten disconnected twice now for no reason my mileage tracker first and now my bank accounts. tried to sign in on an alternate device and was asked to resubscribe. took my moneyback had no trouble doing that. but does nothing to alert me that it's no longer tracking my transactions.
sorely disappointed. intuit made good products maybe even great products at one time. now their cloud offerings a just released with out any concern for features and bugs. disappointed. somebody has gotten to big to care about their customers.
awesome. love this app!! so easy and quick to use
excellent online app. if you don't need all the features of the desktop version, this app is great. if you need to access your accounting remotely, then it is just the ticket. it will continue to get more features as time goes by which will only make it better.
update ruined app. since the last update you cannot run credit cards on the app. it crashes immediately when you attempt to. my business uses qb on 25 devices. all crash when taking payments. this has caused a massive issue for us and clients. beware of putting too many eggs in the basket of a company that can be sloppy with the interface they sell you.
. very useful software all customers use
. good app, needs to have more functionality, less clicks to use and needs auto log in
. great program a little expensive but well worth it
. love this app love this app
great app!. an awesome compliment to the web version. addition of balance sheet would be beneficial. cheers!
. contractor version of the app
. when i am logged in, i can see all of my vendors, even ones i recently added, but there is zero activity listed underage vendor. customer service take several days to get back to me and then they don't actually answer my question
. es un excelente programa, pero no encuentro opción para idioma español, está disponible en español la versión mobil ?
does the job. very effective app to make small business owners productive.
awesome interface. awesome app. that's what it says it will do. the only problem is when i log an expense it attaches receipts as images and not as pdfs. also i do not like the image scanner it doesn't trim around the edges of the receipt. i end up having to use a pdf scanner and then attach the receipt in quickbooks online in a browser.
this works for me.... i have a hard time keeping up with my invoices but this makes it simple for me to keep track on the move or like right now laying in my bed creating invoices and estimates. this is great.
. the worst customer service ever. i would give them zero.
easy to edit invoice. was happy to be able to edit an invoice on the fly without the need to be in the office to log onto the computer to do so!
not free : pricing hard to find. i'm a business person, not a gambler. a bit dodgy that pricing is only given after setup. like playing 3 card monty in an ally, not impressed.
very useful mobile app. i don't expect my mobile version (android) to replace my desktop version. for checking customer balances, emailing invoices, and receiving payments it's a perfectly useful app. quick and easy access to invoices, customer balances, expenses, customer info, p&l and balance sheet. i'm not running or expecting more sophisticated reports from my phone! works great for what i need!
love. so helpful first time business owner. learning as i go.. this app. has helped me so much
give me a refund. i hate this app it’s trash an i want my money back !!!
. hard to use. i bought it because of taking pictures of my receipts and i've yet to get that done. plus the app doesnt work on my phone. have to log in each time. if i had it to do over again i would not waste my money.
. very useful app
. this app is extremely slow, to the point of being unusable. the bank feed is ridiculously slow, anf accepting transactions lags terribly.
. a really good platform for small business. the program is user friendly and has a great online help community and customer service.
. great app, very useful
. very nice app for pme
very good. it should be able to synchronize with quickbooks desk top.the online version on the pc sucks!!!! not user friendly,and very limeted,
crashes non stop on ipad. crashes non stop on ipad
. i've been using quickbooks desktop for 15 years and have always loved it. the switch to online was as smooth as can be. this app is saving me time and money. i highly recommend!
. excellent lots of options for writing reports and looking up data
. the app was good until the free teial was up. i tried to subscribe but it wouldnt go through.. i uninstalled and reinstalled and lost everything and it still wouldnt work!!!!
. great to have accounting info at your fingertips. only sometimes wish i could get more info from the app but it had all the basic stuff.
credit card payments. with this new update, i cannot select payed with credit card without being prompted to swipe a card. i use square for my credit card transactions, so i don't need to use qb. only cash and check can be selected now.
updates have made it horrible. i love using the online version. the august updates however have tanked the app. it is no longer sharing information between my iphone, ipad, and mac. the sorting feature of estimates is now gone ( pending, accepted, closed) it only shows in last changed order, not good when working with 3 month or longer history. on a positive note, i do like the photo modification for the iphone. it no longer adds to my photo album, just imports to quickbooks.
so easy. this app is user friendly and intuitive. i like being able to see the reports and add attachments to expenses. highly recommended for small businesses owners.
great for pimpin. i keep track of all my hoes daily sales & expenses with quickbooks.
if you don’t use quickbooks you’re probably wasting a lot of time.. i find the day to day management of my business much easier and less time consuming since i started using quick books. as with everything, it isn’t perfect. i would like to see more features on the mobile app. that being said, i only use the app and it works well for me. customer service is excellent. they strive to resolve any issue you throw at them. i would highly recommend!
quickbooks on the go!!!!. i love the program and app. i find that it's easier through the app since i can just take the photo right from my phone. i recommend this for anyone!!!!
charge for an expense???. can't even include an expense on an invoice. rubbish !!!!
as a cpa, i think qboa is by far the best of the big three. it's better organised then myob and xero and accepts wpns which neither xero or myob will. the fact that it's half their price makes it an absolute winner
. i have 2 quickbooks online accounts. not only does the login not even process half of the time, my accounts from one company show up under the other. if you're looking to move to quickbooks online for the mobile app you're going to have to wait. af far as bug fixes go, this has been going on for at least 10 months now so i'm not holding my breath.
. it is awesome, very intuitive, simple, more than value for money paid. can you add bills and bill payment to the mobile version?
easy to use, powerful, brilliant. managing everything on the run is important... with quickbooks i can do pretty much everything i need from my mobile saving me valuable time! only thing i would request is an apple watch app.
great but.... very great app. i rated three stars because you can’t enter employee time from your mobile device. i know it’s a mobile app but you should be able to enter time . i understand that mobile apps are a little different but this seems like a simple task that should be possible. i send invoices and estimates all the time with the mobile app other than that it’s a great app. will update rating when these features are added
"enjoying quickbooks online. easy to use interface and they are frequently updating features. my only complaint is that sometimes when searching for sent invoices it won't recognize, for example 74, when it's ""invoice 2015074"""
doesn't work. app doesn't sync all data with quickbooks online. i see only my company name and customer list. no invoices, expenses etc. intuit support we're not able to help.
*terrible app*. do not take the chance with this program its flawed at best and is only designed to take as much money off you for as long as possible. it has multiple errors all the time. find something for better value and don’t pout it in control of your business because when it fails you have no control whatsoever.
. for the entrepreneur on the go, this app is fantastic. i post my expenses with photos of receipts and create invoices from the car! terrific.
. the online version aaks you to download the app, which doesnt do half the stuff the online version can do. 🤷
needs to improve. the more i use this the more i find things that annoy me. when reconciling the bank why can i not just add a receipt photo to a bank transaction. that way i don't have to add it as an expense then match the bank transaction. it would save me time. seriously considering giving xero a try.......
. if i invoice a client and they mail check or hand me a check or give me cash i cannot record income unless they pay online bank transfer or credit card. so i cannot accurately. so this app is useless. and horrible client management. also need to be online no offline input. also i cannot merge to qb app each charge 9.99 month. cannot merge date as qb has better customer tracking. also neefs time tracking for jobs
last update ruined a great app. invoices won't save now and a customer file disappeared. please fix this app back to operational use soon!
messed up. this program really stinks downloaded my accounts and it got all my accounts wrong
brilliant. this app is very easy to use and does everything i would expect...i am finally getting control of my business after 10 years! thanks quickbooks
1 step forward  2 steps back. for the most part, the app functions correctly after finally resolving the issues with accepting credit cards. now, it wants to download the company information each morning. it is doing it on all the devices and accounts that our company uses. it's very frustrating when we need to quickly pull up a customers information only to be forced to wait for it to redownload all the info. hurry up and wait
. great app! it gets the job done!
. so easy to use and realized how much i've been spending. really hurting profits. now i can minimize expenses and increase profits. worth every penny!!!!
this is a total disaster. quickbooks online is a complete and total mess. my invoices are duplicating themselves in the register, the register isn't adding correctly, and my sales tax isn't correct so it has to be done by hand. when you call customer service, they have no answers and never bother to return your call because nobody there knows how to fix the issues. i would recommend that nobody ever uses quickbooks online.
. this software is superb for business owners but need some customization in product and services option they should provide stock quantities in app
can't login. every time i try to login it says that i don't have an online subscription.
"rubbish. ""run your entire business""  what a joke. this app is pretty useless to do anything. quickbooks is already hard to use and this just doesn't help."
overall good product. not having access to the entire online tools on the app makes for complicated tasks at times. the online browser does not run fluently with a safari browser so if i need anything beyond basics i need to get to a pc.
the speedy man, owner. i run my business on quickbook online for a year, and i never had any issues. i suggest, to new subscribers, getting familiar with the desktop version and having a basic accounting background , we can perform a ton of tasks on it. afterwards, we can start using the mobile app.
". the banking feature is horrible. i hear it's a problem across the board with androids. while trying to add expenses that have been imported from my bank, the app freezes or crashes. calling quickbooks gave me a generic ""we are working on it"" response but no solution. if they didn't have the market cornered on accounting software i'd use something else. but alas, i'm stuck with the frustration and urge to throw my phone everyday."
office. excellent app
excellent tool for my biz. since i got this app on my phone i hardly need to go to the office, or open my laptop. love it!
. quickbooks online is great, but the app does not include much for keeping your business mobile. all the small things really upset me, such as not showing inventory quantity on hand in the app. i'll just keep using the web browser until the app is up to par.
quickbook app is it working after updating iphone to the latest version ios 13. when you open the app it auto close. basically can’t open the app
. great way to keep up with my business expenses in realtime
hot garbage. latest update to this piece of garbage app requires you to log in every single time. pathetic these guys can’t get it right. update 020219; still has constant logout problems after all these years. would give 0 stars if i could.
great app!!!. keeps me up to date when i'm out of the office and very user friendly.
jan 2019 update is a fail. i’m a daily  hourly user. the january 2019 update won’t keep me logged in. after about 90 seconds i get an error message and get logged out.
love this app. such a clean and well developed app for quickbooks! love it!
. buyer beware. you can't cancel your subscription online or through the app like you would with any other subscription service. you have to call them and play phone tag for a while if you decide that this service isn't right for you.
. was wary, but the convenience is worth a lot until the latest update. now i cant sign on. been a week since they told me there was an issue. still not resolved. spent several hours on hold listing to garbled elevator music that can not be turned down. customer support blows.
great app!. so easy to use, really makes a difference to be able to invoice and do payments on the move.
really great :). really great software package. requires some dedicated learning for someone with no accounting  bookkeeping background  but functionality and power of the software are fantastic. very happy with quickbooks. thanks :)
. i can show up on the job given an estimate 10 minutes later i've got a down payment , and the confirmation to do the job i've never had this ever before in my life
. great app
error!. when i login with credentials it says connecting and finally shows me error
very convenient, its great access. could be more useful if advanced features allowed access to edit more, like editing products
finally signature for iphone. love it!!! all of my invoices are generated via my iphone 6, and it was frustrating without having that feature. touch id is a great touch! i like the ability to have different invoice options, but wish i could design it exactly the way i want it. keep up the great work with updates.
. simple. efficient.
. i can't view estimates on this app unless i input them in manually. they will not upload. only customer information and invoices. this makes it very hard to be onpoint with my crew.
what happened to this app??. the quickbooks app used to be a 5 star, user friendly, reliably functional app. since december this app has had issues with freezing, crashing, randomly logging the user out and overall has ran extremely slow. i’ve noticed this on the app for mac as well. while trying to run a business, it would be really nice to have a working invoice and bookkeeping app. please fix this
can't save my invoices!. my app auto updated. now i can't save my invoices on the go. i use this app all day, 6 days a week. i'm in the home services industry and i can no longer invoice my clients, which means i can't collect payment either! get this fixed!
. keeps crashing! i can't even get the app to start up to the log in screen most of the time.
extremely limited. to be honest, this app does almost nothing i would want it to do. if all you want to do is record payments or call a business contactgreat. if you actually want to keep up with your business (banking, reports, employees, payroll, etc) on the go, this app is near useless. i can't imagine why you would pay to use this. even free i am deleting right away so it doesn't waste any more of my time or space.
app does not work. i have been unable to see my profits and loss on the app for months now and often the app does not let me log in. i get constant errors. i have spent hours with tech support on the phone all they say is “it’s a known bug”. they have not been able to tell me for months when will the app work again.
update killed app for me!. used to love this app as i’m a paid subscriber, but the recent update doesn’t launch anymore. i’ve tried removing and reinstalling same result. iphone x.
please fix. 1. when creating an estimate or invoice you can not add the project location. 2. also i have an item for notes on my estimates which should not show any price numbers (0.00) 3.i can not edit the way estimates  invoices look. i try it in android and apple both apps have the same problem. if you fix that the app will be perfect.
good app. it's come a long ways since it was first introduced. can't be without it!
. keeping on top of expenses and invoicing is easy with quickbooks online.
user friendly. i can keep track of and operate my business from my phone. love it!
crashing app. latest update crashes constantly on iphone 11 pro. fix it.
. this is a great app for small businesses on the go. 👍👍
. haven't been able to access my books since early september, can only use desktop app, browser and mobile app gives error message. contacted support 4+, engineers are working on known problem...10 weeks and counting
. wonderous estimating. billing. accounting. all on the go? this app is the shizz!!!!
***** updated latest.. very useful.
. quickbooks online is awesome and is super valuable for my business, i am not one to recommend, but it saves me hours and i recommend it to everyone. the desktop program is great that i download for my pc, it has all the same useful features as the online platform. the apps are not the same. they are missing a lot of the features, and frankly useless. i typically just login through the browser with my android tablet and iphone....sorry just the truth!
good app. easy to use
quickbooks online. very good application and it's a very matured application, if only it can support arabic text it will be very suitable to people in this region as well.
more than annoyed..... new update: 8916, still have to enter my password every time i open the app. touch id or app pin what is that??? 🤔 this is so annoying.... especially in front of customers!! tired of wasting my time. i've deleted and reinstalled the app to no avail. it appears you guys are never going to get it right....
best app ever. it works awesome i recommended 100%
login error. upgraded to an s7 and cannot login. i need the mobile app for my business!
. error with signing up. can't sign up so i'll uninstall.
great package. i'm on the road and this accounting package works great. also nice that my accountant has direct access.
. this website is terrible and the customer service is friendly yet not helpful!!! i want to cancel my subscription and yet told to remove the app from my tablet....wrong by removing the app it does not cancel my subscription...very unhappy!!
rubbish. app crash every second
. great app everthing i need from quickbooks in one app
appliance men. great app.. 💯. all you need to run your small business on the go ... team it up with square for the ultimate in portability team both up with an ipad and you have excellence
don’t bother downloading!. this app was so hard to use, wouldn’t connect to my bank, wasted so much time trying. brought up all of my personal accounts transactions even though i asked it to hide them. wouldn’t bring up transactions older than 3 months. i honestly don’t understand how anyone can use it!!!
nothing but disappointment. car tracking constantly shows that there is uncategorised trips when it is up to date. software won’t integrate with desktop version. 3 days before end of financial year quickbooks stops bank account updating inputs. then quickbooks support solution causes double entries. two week later accounts won’t update anymore again.
great app. with a little practice i'm happy to pay.
it's ok. for a big name like quickbooks it should have a lot more features. my old cheap invoicing app worked much better. can't just open a list of all open invoices witch is stupid. only let's you see open invoices and then if it's over due you have to click on the over due link to see all the overdue ones
#1. the only business app i'll ever need...thank you!
problemas con la tasa de importe. no puedo editar ni agregar una tasa o precio del artículo en las facturas ni estimaciones en iphone 7 plua
brian peterson remodel. great app. wish i could attach pictures to estimates and invoices using my mobile app.
still not what i need!!. this is not what i need as an accountant to handle quickbooks functions on the go. why can't we just have access to the full functionality of quickbooks online? i still can enter bills to be paid or checks to be printed. these are two of the most important functions i handle for my clients. let me know when i can get it all!
"great app!. easy to use and good customer service. i used the ""chat online"" service. very helpful and especially like that i can email a copy of the chat conversation to myself."
doesn't let you attach items. ....... yep, doesn't let you attach items. wtf?
excellent online software. i love this system made my job a lot easier my phone is my office
really good !. used a different invoicing program for years but would not sync with quickbooks. so i went over to the best and figuring it out. quickbooks online has made it easy to work through. good job developers !!
useless. takes too long to add a simple expense.
current update just crashes. ios10 with the new update on ipad don't work. app opens then immediately closes.
poor service, poor quality product. this product is the worst i have had to deal with. service is non existent, the app is constantly in errors, backing up is slow, the system does manual and not by the operator, everytime the + symbol is used it closes the app. my accountant doesn’t even like the system. i have loaded, unloaded and reloaded the app so many times it’s no longer a joke. quick books tells me they fixed the fault, like never.
. love this app. life has gotten so much more organized and business transactions so much easier
onion vs. desktop. i have just purchased the desktop version. i would.like to use the app to record my expenses on the fly. from what i can tell you need to have an online account to do so. please help if there is a way.
. really easy and great to keep on track of things
. absolutely unless on android. it does not show the right invoices overdue only a select few and shows completely different things and different sums of money on iphone compared to android phone, in fact its completely different on all platforms i.e tablet android, ipad, pc windows and iphone.
will not let me access my info!!!. ever since i got new phones for my technicians ,samsung s5, i have not been able to access any of my customers, transactions, or invoices. i use qbo for my business, but have now lost all mobile capabilities. if not resolved, i will be forced to use a different accounting software. 5 stars if working properly.
as others have said. don't get the point.. i guess the mint guys are in charge now? the guys that created a consumer finance app that didn't have the function to balance a checkbook?
. this app does not work on my samsung galaxy note 8. after told to update, uninstalled and installed, nothing changed.
excellent interface and convenient app. this app is a life saver and helps me run my small business affairs smoothly. i can submit my invoices and estimates on the go with ease. definitely a must app to have.
. can't get the app to open at all being charge for something that not even use at all pls close the account thx
. using it for years no problems
. i have had this app for my business for about 1 year. every time i spent the money new transection comes up 2 time . and it's too hard to remove on transection.
. where is the bank balance? so confusing to use.
loads of bugs since updating to ios 13. broken links. can’t call up customer information. dashboard only shows banking information. invoices and estimates haven’t saved when generated on mobile device.
great software. very happy i use to use a different software but it wasn't as good as quickbooks thank you quickbooks
good app but.... i automatically give apps that force me to rate them a onestar.
. love that i can create estimates, invoices, and view my banking account activity all on the go with one app.
. cannot log in don't have online subscription
help. there doesn't seem to be a way to tie in purchases on to a invoice to charge specific customers. when you call in for help with the app, customer service does not have access to see what you're looking at.
fantastic. it's so handy to have quick books with me wherever i go! i can balance my bank register, create invoices and take payments on the go.
useless. all i want is to do, while i am out and about, is enter my expenses and take a pic of the receipt and sync it. not even close to happening with this app.
crap. this app is a piece of crap my dad got it on our computer.when u scroll it goes the opposite way and there is also a bunch of other crap. i would. it recommend getting this
best bookkeeping app. it has everything you need to make your small business life easy & hassle free!
. good app
awesome. i couldn't run my small business like a big business without quickbooks! just that awesome and simple!
. i haven't been able to use this app for a really long time, all the sudden it doesn't save my login details anymore, hard to login, once i logged in and try to go next step, it logged me out and says tempary not available. super annoying!!
thumbs up for the business help!!!. take the time to go through the orioles and this is an amazing app to help with any small business!!!
charge by stealth. i downloaded this app to try it out. before i knew it i was being charged $4.99 per month. my understanding is that it is free with in app purchases, but i never subscribed to this. i abhor these types of sneaky apps. i recommend you don't download it, or if you do, be very careful.
efficient. this app makes my life easier. has all the features i need to keep my business running smoothly.
love the qbo. mobile expense posting is cool
app will not open after update. app will not open on my iphone, making it impossible to input expenses and worse still accept payment on jobs!
not great for my line of business. doesn’t aloud me to itemize product with different price for each one of my client
mobile use. a dream from the desktop days. send my small business invoices on the go makes going home a time to relax instead of paper work.
. doesn't work properly
best ap and program for home business. i trailed several other programs before quickbooks. it allows me to split an expense between personal and business which others wouldn't. the ap is easy to use and love that i can take a photo of the receipt. no more loosing receiptshaving them fade etc.
. honestly it's great, good for simple business use.. links well back to qb online.
heatingcooling guy. trying to use the app. nothing is happening, app opens and it’s blank this morning. preformed an update too, still nothing. garbage app, sorry.
quickbooks online is a lifesaver!. we have a small family owned and operated business. i love the simple user interface that quickbooks online uses. it's very easy to get started with and it saves us so much time. the reports are clean and well put together and it gives me so much flexibility when categorizing expenses. it also integrates perfectly with our square card reader and gives us the option to attach receipts. all around perfect bookkeeping software for people on the move!
". this app is trash, has me very upset won't let me add a bank account just keeps saying ""hmm connection error"". this is bs i just signed up for this service and won't let me connect your app sucks and most likely will seek a refund. have tried wifi, mobile, what the funk, not quick in my opinion..."
best app. love this app makes it easy for me to track all my buisness transactions. recommend
. won't update, can't even click the help menus. save your money and get an accountant. just work more hours
qb online. i like the app but there are a few glitches. can not run some reports.
very beneficial app. this is a very beneficial app. it does not replace the pc version but is an excellent aid. it's helpful to send invoices on the go or at the end of a service call. the sooner the customer gets invoice the more chance i have of getting paid. it is a very good aid!
great app. it sure is nice to be able to do things anytime anywhere.
. does the trick. is easy to use and does not cost and arm and a leg. i'd reccomend.
was great and then they updated it. i loved this app when i first got it. i used it all the time for 5 months strait, and then they 'updated' it. now, it's awful. i don't see any of the new features and it is buggy beyond belief. please go back to the older version. this is a joke.
simple but robust.. with a great user interface connecting with the larger data and programme, i’m impressed by the elegant and obviously intentional design. when i look at my phone, i’m looking at exactly the kind of information that i would need on the go. very good design work by these guys.
. i'm completely new to this app. because of that i might not know what to look for. but this makes starting up a business extremely easy. definitely plan on subscribing once the trial is up. 👍and would gladly suggest this app to anyone looking for this kind of help and ease.
. very useful, simple, and advantageous over other apps when it comes down to the feasibility and quick access.
great to app to have. loving the app. i would give it 5 stars if it was able to function the same or close to the online version.
fair app version, but not good as browser version. i’m not able to select item groups when creating an invoice. also im not able to enter sku when creating an item. neither im able to search items by sku info... they dont let you set a fixed price for an item group on any version of the software which o find really easy to implement by code which is dumb...
. great app, very helpful. has a few glitches that can be frustrating.
ipad mini. app works great
great way to run a business. the way razorsync and quickbooks works together makes it possible for me to have a life after work! there are a few more things that would make life easier but overall a big thumbs up! one more star for a stronger search engine, can't find invoices by number or customers by address
convenient and efficient. this app allows me to create invoices and collect for my plumbing services in the field and takes care of the book keeping simultaneously! i can also email the invoice to my customer instantly, which my customers seem to appreciate.
. very easy to use and efficient method of bookkeeping, invoicing and streamlining communication with my accountant. perfect for a small business.
ipad app. please update your app to be more like the desktop version...i can not track inventory received through the ipad app i purchased and ipad pro hoping to do away with my laptop and so far its been seamless, except for this app not being able to track inventory received. i hope your developers can figure this out before my 8 year old laptop crashes! thanks
touch id rules. much easier to login now.
addicted to billing now!!!. oh my goodness. this app is no joke. love it and i stay up late looking at all it has to offer and new things. i’m glad i got this and the card reader. thanks qb
paid for itself in one hour. after a long, frustrating search for a robust but simpletouse accounting platform for my growing fitness business, i came across quickbooks and have been exuberant ever since. my invoices go out on time, expenses go in live, and it even tracks my inventory. paid for itself in the first hour. highly recommend.
everything i need. the quickbooks app has met every one of my needs for my small handyman business. i love the ability to email customers estimates, invoices, and sales receipts while i am standing there with them. i have only been using the app for a little over a month but i feel good about my decision to go with quickbooks online.
do not use mobile to create your account. lost all our data on our old account because apparently if you first sign up using ios you absolutely cannot continue the subscription using your computer. had to just make a new account. you also can’t access any of the profile from the computer once the subscription runs out so i wasn’t able to download and save any of the data either. do not use mobile to create yor account.
. great app!
. not supported in india... so, i have uninstalled it from my phone...
handy app. useful when adding info onsite. can be a little confusing to tell if the data you are working on is current, or needs refreshing.
great app. i’ve been a subscriber for about 3 years it’s a great app ... for me the one thing lacking is being able to enter and track progress payments.
. i am really happy by the way it helps me keep track of my expenses and consumption taxes. one thing i would like to see on the mobile app is being able to view your taxes, same as you can on the desktop version.
. the app is useless. google sign in simply doesn't work. links to my invoices still open in browser even when i have the app installed.
email issue. when emailing invoicesestimates with other attachments the quickbooks attachment doesn't go through
. won't update....
so easy. couldn't have been an easier to make the switch to online. so far, so good
tek9. isai tek
crashes on large invoice. works fine until you get a large invoice and then it slows down and or crashes
too many extra charges. i would like to have an ultimatum plan where all the services and fees were included with one rate. right now each thing costs an additional charge per usage such as deposit fees and running each payroll. can’t you come up with a flat fee?
at $12.99 month not free (false advertising). imagine my surprise, i trusted qbooks desktop to run my company, not sure i can trust some goof advertising free app and not letting you see anything unless you sign the free trial then $12.99month
lacking features. when receiving a payment or creating a receipt, i'd like to be able to take a photo of the check or any other attachment i want. i'd also like to be able to choose the class and what account it's going into. these are all things i can do through the web browser.
. great app help me so much with my company
love new layout. love this app it allows me to create invoices and receipt on the go with tablet or phone
not accurate, crashes often. this app goes from being usable to worthless on a whim. it also does not show simple things like how many $ in open invoices, (right now it says we have $488 in total receivables, when we have way more). the desktop app is fine, the ios app needs a ton of work.
. similar issues as gillian, dashboard blank, constant error messages on mobile. i also ended up accidentally reinstalling a slightly different version and was paying double!! i didn't realize there were two very similar apps!! i also uninstalled reinstalled and it didn't fix issue. i am currently trying to figure out how to recover all the expenses and photo's of receipts for the tax season.
service date is still broken. has had this problem for months and a fix has yet to be included in an update. will be not be staying with quickbooks.
"keep getting ""session expired"" message with every log in attempt. completely makes the app nonfunctional for on the go business. critical flaw! please fix it!!"
crashing after ios 13 update. after ios 13. i can not log into my quickbooks app please fix this asap
great apps. easy to use
. great program
. i have only problem is that my overdues 6 invoices are not showing in overdues... please clear this issue
. it has been 6 days and i still have not had my money deposited to my bank. oh and it is the day before thanksgiving. this is complete bs. negative stars. i need my money now. you guys should be embarrassed... 6 days and still not deposited. your customer service center lied to me and said it would be there...
"cumbersome. cumbersome and clunky to deal with. constantly checking to make sure i'm not a robot. security is appreciated but this is ridiculous and really slows me down. used to be good but got updatedtweaked""improved"" past the point of being useful. now i dread having to use it."
horrible. please update this app so it stops crashing during every use!!! also, critical updates every time you try and do anything???? getting old and frustrating. fix it!!!!! also, why when you update a transaction, it saves it from before the update, so you are doing the work twice???
please update. please update app or bring previous version constantly downloading customer data that takes forever and then get errors please fix quick
great but could be greater. easy to use book work became so much easier with quick books online the only thing that i don't like is that you should be able to do everything across all platforms: ipad,iphone,laptop
easy, fast, convenient. love using this app! it is really easy to navigate and lets me do everything i need to very quickly. always in sync no matter which device i'm on.
. the app freezes frequently. when it's not freezing, it's too slow.
needs a lot of work. very disappointing they removed card payment facility, only reason i went with quickbooks over xero. also don't try and do anything within app or your accounts will get into a right mess (things like match a payment or transfer) you will end up with duplicate transactions that can only be deleted by logging into web client. upsetting the company that all those years ago changed the industry (and took on sage) have failed so badly.
needs lots of work. very hard to use app. many options are hidden or unavailable so you are stuck and wind up doing the work through a browser instead
excellent new user interface. i waited quite a while to switch to the new user interface for quickbooks, because i usually find that such updates change without really improving. but i was pleasantly surprised. tasks are much easier with the new interface and the android app is much improved. excellent job!
awesome i just need to learn to use it. its awesome i love it but im new to it so i have a little bit of trouble using some of the features but im sure i will get the hang of it with time n experience
. useless app. can't integrate one of the biggest bank of australia (cba) with this app. support is just forwarding issue from one team to other. wated almost one hour on the phone. solution is to forward the issue to next level. there are three companies under my account with same name. cannot delete company. how app allow to create three identical names?? wast of time and money.
. update: no longer freezes but is now saving estimates and invoices multiple time and showing 70k extra in income from invoices and bank deposits which it's now not allowing us to match payments with invoices so our only current option is to delete all duplicate payments and have customers outstanding balances until this is fixed
great way to punish your workers. yeah, a client uses this and when he sent me a 1099 it took 30 minutes of creating an account, retrieving passwords, recreating passwords, etc just to look a file that was supposed to be mailed weeks ago. terrible system trying to force the people you work with into accounts and products to access forms that are legally required. please use other software and services that care more about their user experience.
thomas storey. i downloaded quickbooks online to my tablet. i have used it once to get out a quick invoice. for some reason i can't download it to my phone through google play. is there a different way to get the app?
awful app.. literally the worst business related app that i have to deal with. get ready to log in every six seconds and have no changes saved when you modify things. the idiotic data entry fields do not allow you to enter information half the time. if literally anyone anywhere came up with a program that would import my contacts and records from this steaming pile of junk, i would switch.
bad update. i was having trouble with the mileage tracker and now with the update i can’t even check the settings. please fix this. i am paying for this service to help run my business. this isn’t a free game app.
unreliable. this app is buggy and slow. logging in is very hit or miss. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't for no apparent reason. i have not been able to log in for a week. all i get is an error message telling me to try again later. called support and i was told that they are working on it. this app has been out for years, and there is no excuse for it being so unpredictable.
it's gotten a smidgen better. i want to be able to edit deposits and click on numbers in the reports to see details and edit things.
. update has not fixed this issue! why can't i see bank account details in the app? you can on the ios app contacted help desk who couldn't help! without access to accounts the app is effectively useless. i have done everything you suggest. home screen is now blank! so even worse than when i started. i have also contacted support with no solution as yet.
. how do you create a new user. i have followed the instructions but can't create one, as their is no create button. i've tried on the phone app and i have tried on the laptop still now joy.
qb online. app
. was working great until now... not working on my phone (samsung) with this new update...fix this problem asap... keeps telling me there's a new update i have to download even after i installed it... kicks me out of the app.... i've uninstalled and reinstalled this 4 times already... very disappointing!!!!!
. nice app for my very complicated business:)
not happy with new update. new update has made navigating to the chart of accounts very annoying. you have to access one of 3 accounts (determined by qbs) that show up on the main page and then push the back button, magically the accounts list appears. poor design, but a simple fix. i don’t mind that the menu button has moved to the bottom, just please add a “chart of accounts” link. thanks.
good app. very useful app when on the go.
. very useful app.
excellent software. so easy to use, it's great and self explanatory.
tax invoice as per india standard. dear, please give us more invoice style templates as per india stander
don't update!!!!. if you are using the current version of quickbooks online for your ipad 2, don't update. it will lock you out. then you will have hours of dealing with the horrible customer no service that intuit provide for this mess of a product.
great. perfect app for my business accounts on d go
needs improvement. i just started using this app while traveling. it doesn’t compare to the site on my pc. very unfriendly and difficult to impossible to bring up to date.much incomplete data. need to go to work on this one of its to be useful.
. it's really nice to be able to do all of my businesses invoicing and filing on my phone. don't particularly like the ui on the mobile though.
. intuit sucks! scamming company ran by non english speaking reps. bought simple start 2007 for 125.00 with online access ,etc. in 2010 they ended all support for this software. that is shady. they promise you all these free services and then years later a foreigner informs you that all support has ended. to better serve there newer products. they suck.
the best software. is the best accounting software , is easy to use ,
app crashes. everything was great until one day the app crashed. now crashes every time i open it. reinstalled and same issue. help????
amazing. great app and really easy to use. no need to wait to be at the office to do any transaction, all done easy and simple right on the spot!!!!!!!
excellent!!!. this is easy to use and very convenient! most of the functionality on the app means it's easy to work will out of the office!
there’s just 1 thing... i have been loving the way this program functions. the only thing i continually wish for is that i would be notified when a customer opens an estimate, not just the invoice.
much help. other then the normal bugs, this program works well and is easy to work with. nothing in this life is perfect but they strive to make it so. thank you staff of quick books. keep up the good work. peace & blessings.
. doesn't work on pixel 3xl. crashes as soon as it starts every time. wave works great though!
seles. how’s this quicker, how do you add vat, i was quite happy doing an invoice on my own heading paper, which looked professional, not like this useless thing that has cost more account fees 
used for many years but. intuit is increasing the price of quickbooks by 25% the next billing period. the app doesn’t support key functions that you can access online, for example adding multiple email addresses to one invoice.
2x features missing from making this 5 stars.... 1: ability to do ‘purchase orders’ in expenses 2: ‘void’ sales invoices
. it's great to send invoices and estimates through email from my phone
i love this app. i love all of the features it currently has. i wish we had more of the controls we had from our qbo web version. 4616  i love that i can now see my check registers & a few other things have been updated. added the final star!
needs work. glitches, freezes all the time, constant updates asks me to review app while i'm using app so annoying
exporting and texting invoices. anytime i export and try to forward an invoice to a customer with an android it will not send it. iphones are no problem, but androids do not accept it. i have to screenshot it. recommend patch to fix this.
crashes a ton. this is a great app for bookkeeping for my business, but it crashes almost daily on my iphone. please get better engineers for the functionality of this app!! so frustrating when i’m in the middle of printing invoices and the app crashes! how am i supposed to conduct business that way!?!
discount. one of the best accounting software on the market. the only think that maybe can be added is the discount feature on the invoice.
so much you can't do on the app!!. app is a bit pointless as so much you can't do that you end up having to go onto web based site to do
new update sucks. latest update for android takes forever to refresh and save invoices. almost unusable for me when i'm on the job. takes over five minutes to save an invoice and then even longer to print one if will will even let me...tried to uninstall and reinstall and reboot and everything it still takes way too long to refresh and save.
works perfect. i enjoy using qb it allows me to send invoices from where ever i'm at also i can except payments from the field. it's been awesome to run my small business for 2 years.
. very good app
keeps everything in one place. great app! i keep all my business and personal expenses logged and in place from my phone. i can also track multiple companies. gives me so much piece of mind and way easier for keeping track of taxes and book keeping.
simply superb!. quick books app really took my accounting overview in a single glance. thanks qb team for amazing ui
new update crashes every time. new update makes me close and reopen every time for critical app updates
. works well. there are some functional restrictions from the desktop app. but works well enough
slow. very slow
mgrm. great app. useful and easy to use.
. i am very glad with this app, one day it will work by just thinking about it, very close though...😁
smallbusiness rocket!. great app. this is making my small business very productive. especially since the account is device agnostic. i can use it on my device or login online and be just as efficient.
stupid app. and never works right nightmare to login
no employee section. this app contains nothing to help your employees, only the business manager. quick books could’ve at least added support for timesheets and such since they no longer allow you to save your timesheet in mobile browsers.
great app. it's a one stop accounting app for me and it's made my life so much easier having it.
. so easy to post expenses from bank transactions.
used to love it.... ever since the app was updated, i can no longer get past the sign in screen on my galaxy note 5. at least it still works on my ipad i guess...
easy to use.. does what i need it to do. helps me record my sales and expenses without a pc.
crashes a lot. generally works okay, but crashes a lot on a 256gb ipad pro. you have to continually save your work to keep from losing everything every few minutes.
awesome. this app is great and extremely helpful with my small business. it saves a lot of time and work. not only do i find it very resourceful but it's easy to use. customizing my invoices and estimates is probably the best part of the application aside from it allowing me to check my profit and loss. i recommend this app to any user, especially a business owner.
no recurring transactions. why the hell would you make an app if it can't do any thing but read. i want to edit recurring transactions; edit and send invoices; and see every report. this is absolutely stupid, just sign in from a browser.
works okay but app needs work. funny how if they spent a little more time and money on their point of sale app that they could get two to three times the amount of business. the app needs work. there needs to be more options for customizing the invoice and it really lacks customer management ability. if your just going paperless it’s not bad but like i said the app could really use some work.
review. i am self employed, i find quickbooks is easy to use as my business is extremely simple. i do have an issue with the annual cost. i think that you should have different rates for individuals like myself who only use it a few times a week.
david. brilliant i would highly recommend to anyone 10 out of 10. certainly made my life and running my small business easier. well done and many thanks quickbooks
new version stinks. one of the main reasons i use the app is so that i can pull up my customers entire transaction history when i'm out in the field. the previous version did that beautifully. other problems as well.
helped a lot. i am so happy that i listened to the accountant at work who recommended qb to me. it has made tracking business expenses and my taxes so much easier.
fantastic application. i love this app. it let's me manage my expenses and easily invoice on the go. great tool!
getting better with every upgrade.. great app. they do lure you with the free use then hit ya with the charges later. i think it's a useful tool in the toolbox.
not great. there are multiple problems wrong with this program. you can't bill a customer when you attach a receipt which means i constantly have to switch between devices. my expenses according to the customer are incorrect. i'd like to see my estimateinvoice minus my expenses per job. the only reason i switched to this program from freshbooks, which is way less expensive and more user friendly is because quickbooks has a balance sheet, which our accountant required.
". i laughed at one of the quickbooks employees response to the app being slow... they said their goal is to make it as convenient as the qbo app... lol lol bad comparison. online version is tragically slow, short of (what should be) obvious capabilities, even some quickbooks older versions have had for years. and, when challenged, their tech support essentially says ""we are quickbooks if you don't do it our way or using our workaround then you must be doing it wrong"""
the software has been a nightmare recently using iphone and ipad keeps saying i haven't paid. i've written to emails and had absolutely no response to either no refunds either because i can't get the software to work unless i'm in mice studios on my laptop which is being fixed currently i won't be with me for the next four weeks so how i'm supposed to do any invoicing i have no idea this is absolutely ridiculous use sage...
great app. very helpful, only complaint is, i would like more features like the desktop version. i would like to be able to get into my online version and accept register transactions, look at taxes that are owed, stuff like that. but over all a huge time saver. and has gotten me out of some tight spots. thank you
great app. i use that app quite frequently. easy to use and gives me all the information i need to access.
don’t bother if you don’t have an accounting degree. this app is terrible. it doesn’t allow me to do anything that i need to day to day and then i have to go back at the end of the month and redo almost everything i have done for the month. waste of money and time. an excel spreadsheet is more accurate.
been asking for a simple feature for years.. still to this day i’m amazed i cannot do the most important task on the mobile app. if i’ve created an expense via my desktop. i have no way of viewing it or editing it on the mobile version. it’s totally un integrated.
still useless. what is this for? can't see the check register, can't add vendor bills. you should be able to access all aspects of qb online. i guess its ok if all you want to do is look at pretty graphs.
. the quickbooks mobile app is userfriendly and has most of the functions available the pc app has.
it's broke :(. wonderful app, latest update has caused many issues, including signing in with fingerprint or app code. have to do a full sign in each time with email and loooooong password. hope they can fix soon! 😩😖😤
. this company is a joke they will not allow hempbased transactions it is preventing my freedom of doing business the fed has mandated banks take money on hemp transactions
. nice to have everything on my phone. the app works very well.
not very good. this app dose not work with samsung galaxy s 6 or 6 edged, iv phone over 6 time now and just keep getting fobbed off , i don't even think thinking quickbooks technical support know wat they are doing i'm just left in the dark
dashboard is a great. the most recent upgrade gives users a real time understanding of a companies finances through graphical representation.
great app. the quickbooks application allows me to quickly see my bank accounts, profit and loss statements, balance sheet, invoices etc.
disappointed. although it loaded up ok, it didn't refresh my data that i had added online. i emailed support who are supposed to reply in 24 hrs but never heard anything. so unless they get this sorted it's going to be deleted.
. quickbooks app is the easiest invoicing app i have ever used.
"locks, freezes, and won't sync. updated last week and haven't been able to use it since. i've reinstalled, cleared cache, resynced data... nothing. qb customer service ""can't see any issues with my login"" so who knows ? ive been reduced to entering all my invoices from my computer at home (defeats the purpose of the app doesn't it?). until they fix this update, don't download it."
great app for business.. a ++ must have app
easy to use!. love being able to take photos of receipts on the go!!
good but won’t take my money. every time i put my card info they charge me $1.00 and then it says subscription canceled. so i put in my info again and agin and they charge my card $1 but it never runs so i can be a member.
makes life easy. haven't worked through 100% of the app but as of right now it has made accounting world easier. especially keeping up to date with bank account reconciliation.
. still trying to figure out if i want to use this program, but i like what i have used so far
four years of online qb. qb has simplified my life, given me access to billing for my clients on my cell phone and made it super easy to process transactions. i'm also able to allow my bookeeper, cpa and salesperson access to the areas they need. the only thing that would make it better would be having the ability to print transaction reports for vendors like we can for customers.
easy to use!. a 5 yr old with a lemonade stand could run this application. it is very useful and easy to get things done. such a great tool to keep track of your business
. great app.
zero stars 10.3 is junk. i used this app several times a day. i run my business on this app. since april 10th i cannot access my data. my business is suffering and intuit cannot fix it. i still have to pay. tech support at intuit  quickbooks recommended i switch to a android. (i doesn't work on my iphone or ipad) i really do not want to invest in new hardware. stay away from intuit they do not care and offer no solutions.
very good app. if i could link my icall to it, it would be perfect 5 stars
statement from app ?. works great for me but i wish you were able to print off a statement from the app. with all the updates lately. why is it so hard to be able to create a statement from the app? not the biggest deal in the world but very inconvenient. so a lot of updates lately and still no way to create a statement from the app. this really is very frustrating.
. if you have your own business you need this app!
. very, very slow and to much freezing between transactions. i can't work properly. you need to speed up!
handy and convenient.. i love this app. it is easy to use and always have it all at office when you go to do bookkeeping there. reports may be something to add so i could we what customer owe me. thx
easy to use. not too bad need more bug fixings
. i've already logged in, but, somehow, i've been logged out. then try to log in once again and it doesn't work. the loading indicator just spins the whole time.
lies. says free, makes you sign up for an account saying try it free, and then says you don't have a subscription and closes. bullshit app. deleted.
review. happy with qb is working for me just need to work out how to link my bank in and do my accounts on it this should be simple but l am no wizard on tec. the code that l am ask for from my bank is not linking and not sure why. but so fare it's good.
. nice app keeps my company organized, very easy to use
. like many other i can no longer log in to the app, spoke to barbara on chat via the browser version and she seemed unaware of the problem despite several reviews mentioning it. otherwise i like the app (when it works!) although there are less functions than desktop. good particularly for scanning bills but can't do that at the moment...
predatory data collection. the app wouldn’t allow me to accept payment without my giving it geo location. why do you need it, other than to use it in ways completely unrelated to my bookkeeping? the app was already near useless. good bye qb app!
one of the best accounting software.. very good and well made accounting software. very easy and friendly to use. the things i especially like about this application is that i can book an expense on the go through the mobile app and i can access this accounting software from anywhere and on any device!!
. great app use it all the time
. can't view emails that it sends, it doesn't track when reminders are sent on past due invoices, you can not offer multiple terms (i.e. invoice net 30 but offer a net 15 discount if they pay early). tech support wait times are extensive (40 min on one call, 20 min on a chat). all that and it's expensive.
. awesome app
time tracking. i can create an estimate on the go and keep track of my time in a job.
. won't sync, only shows some of my invoices. am i doing something wrong or ???🤔
please fix!!. i have used this app for the last few years for my business and have loved it. this latest update has made the app virtually unusable. it won't let me save an invoice, doesn't show payments made, makes me sign in every time even though i have a pin and the list goes on. very disappointed and hoping this is fixed soon.
. accurate app
. very good, i am on trial not sure how much full experience will cost, i'll update when i can
ca uday soman. good software for sme
. greeat app love you guys and ladies from all the products of quickbooks
made my life easier. i use to spend all weekend doing paper work and now i do it as i go in the car.
. very frustrating app to use. as an employee i am required to log my daily hours using quickbooks, the app however won't let me even login to it. i go to login and it gives me a message telling me that i am trying to use an u supported role and it will be fixed in future updates. i have to go through the website which the mobile version is not great to use.
simple and easy. great for keeping tabs on your business on the go but would love to have the actual versus budget comparison on the dashboard instead of having to bring up a report.
fantastic software !. currently in a middle of a building site, sending clients invoice & estimates. now my time is my own this evening ! couldn’t do with out it .
brilliant. used other software apps before now and this one knocks socks off them, can access all my account details and add bills and send invoices so much easier during the day now, knocks about 30minutes a night off my admin
lame. i don't understand how anyone can make an app that isn't fully functional on an ipad.
awesome. great app for the ipad. i hate complicated software a to tract my work. this ones the most user friendly app i've come across. great recommendation. 5*****'s
easy to use. as a small business i find this to be a fabulous experience of accounting software integrated across all my various devices. i feel far more in control of my books than any other format or program i have used before. highly recommend this to any mobile business.
. great app. never knew how much time you spen in transit until the tracking app was installed. 👍👍
quickbooks. excellent app, works great for my business.
easy to use and keeps me updated. works great on my s4.
not for administrators. this app may be alright for sales people but doesn't do bookkeepers and admin people any good. i need to check register balances, p & l and balance sheets. this app doesn't allow for that.
great app. very happy we use if for all our companies and recommend to our clients
record keeping at its finest. works great and keeps my business records up to date at all times. so simple to use but capable of handling any business transaction you may need.
easy to use. works so good for business on the go.
highly functional for an app. unlike other folks i find that i can get the majority of what i need to accomplish for daytoday business done on this app. very user friendly.
four leaf hvac. love the app. makes my life a lot easier.
. i'm completely new to this app. because of that i might not know what to look for. but this makes starting up a business extremely easy. definitely plan on subscribing once the trial is up. 👍and would gladly suggest this app to anyone looking for this kind of help and ease.
. this app is very userfriendly
very limited functionality. the app has very limited functionality  i can’t even see the purchase ledger on the app never mind post invoices or take photos of them. lists supplier contact information only, not even account balances. useless. i have to log on to full site and try to navigate around it on phone screen which is difficult. oh and by the way, very unhelpful customer service too!
great, but can learn from others. just my observations: mobile app should be mostly used to record expenses. it lacks ocr tracing. moreover scanning a receipt is a multistep process. should add forcetouch to add receipt (open in camera). invoices: been searching how to add my banking information. cannot believe quickbooks does not allow for adding banking information to invoices. did i miss something? or is it a hidden feature? not very intuitive (pun intended). otherwise good. like the integration with bank account.
excellent app. i am a accountant and this is excellent
excellent. very good app just hate it that it keeps bugging me to give a review
mobile app. you cannot check your inventory or edit invoices from the mobile app.
. great app! very affordable. quick to uload and edit inventory items.
good app with room for improvement. the features they have work well, but many of the features on the website are not included. it has many of the customer options, but not much else. if they ever make this a fully functional app, i'll give it 5 stars.
. this app made me feel more in control of my own books
"about 710. not bad but not good. the app keeps requiring updates if used on apple products. not an issue but the updates never appear. quickbooks blames apple and apple blame quickbooks. we ""updated to the cloud version"" from a pcm based quickbooks. so far we are very very disappointed."
no customer support. this is potentially a great app, but customer support is nonexistent  3 emails sent and 2 weeks waiting for a reply to a subscription issue.
. great app only feature i wish it had is gps millage tracker
. quickbooks makes my life so much easier for writing amd sending estimates and invoices. there are so many other things that quickbooks can do that im slowly learning. im writing so many estimates and getting so much work from easier estimate and invoice writing its really hard for me to get the time sit down amd learn everything else quickbooks has to offer.
good and convenient. i can sync quickbooks on my computer, ipad and iphone. convenient
. great app. really good for when you are on the road.
. handy but a bit slow
verging on useless. download it but don’t expect to get much out of it. how a multibillion dollar company can produce a product so lacking in functionality boggles the mind. it’s almost as if intuit is intentionally trying to offend its customers.
. this app is amazing. still trying to figure everything out for my business but i love it. i just wish i could create order forms for my customers
not accurate. the data on the app does not match the data on my computer when logged into qbo. this gets worse with the more time that passes by. the only way to fix this, at least temporarily, is to uninstall the app from my phone and reinstall it again. that is a real pain! i will now delete the app all together!,
does not work for android any more. after months of calling customer service sending id ,still no luck . app does not work with android phones,it logs in but it's nothing there because it does not want synchronise,so i have my account with no details in it ,except profit and loss. so if any wants to use the app with android phone and have a data on the web do try it .
slow. can be great and convenient but it can also be very slow (just like the online version). won't always let you edit invoices through the app.
easy here, hard there. you can tell this is more for business that need to create invoices more than purchase orders. desktop as well. i’ll give 4 stars when they add a po feature to the app.
"good but not perfect.. a feature is missing that you get on the website for example, search i can't search invoices in the app through ""memo"". why!!!!??? please fix or add a ""memo"" search option, please!!!"
crash instantly on iphone 5. this app crashes instantly and doesn't operate on my iphone 5 running the latest iphone software. i tried removing and reinstalling but it still doesn't work. why don't you guys fix this?
". the app failed to associate my quickbooks online account with the app at login. ""it seems like you have an account with intuit but no quickbooks online company associated with : my@email would you like to create a company?"" additionally, when trying to troubleshoot this issue, i was given the run around through all services... from faqs, to online support, to calling directly. issue still unresolved."
be careful. i resynced my bank feeds and two years of transactions got deleted. i spent an hour on the phone and was told they couldn't fix it...
. great app simplifies accounting so much!
. it's convenient when on the go. love how i can invoice and récord payments when away from office. keeps me on track. easy to work with.
. great app, pretty user friendly. could be more visually appealing. the pc web browser platform is better.
the best mobile app for business i've use!. quickbooks mobile app is the best app i've used for my small business. it has everything i need at my fingertips. thank you intuit.
. this app keeps getting error loading items, to invoice and estimates can't use it. i call them for support and they have no support they referred me to log in on the web site and the same happens the search button flashes and dispensers. don't waste your time and money. if any one know about a good and reliable app let me know. this one is not reliable nor is their support.
. piss poor app most of time it don't work keeps saying error. very disappointed
. app never opens complete bull
doesn’t work. app won’t open and website is unresponsive. not very impressed with the program.
i love quickbooks online. i love quickbooks online & my accountant does also. this app is really good for doing your expenses on but as far as invoicing i still do it on the computer. it's very handy for a small business. the fact you can enter an expense, take a picture of the receipt & go on your merry way. i'm sold.
won't connect to qb online since update.. i've been using qb for ipad with few issues to date, until the latest update. now, i'm on a job, trying to invoice a customer and can not since the app will not connect to qb online.
touch id does not work. i have it checked and yet when i load the app it keeps asking for password. pointless, just remove touch id as an option since it does not work as it should.
paid invoices not turning green or showing paid when they actually are. after receiving the payment, the invoices are not turning green and are not saying paid even though they are paid this is important and needs to be fixed as soon as possible.
. this app coupled with the web based app is the best thing i have seen for small business. cut book work down to an hour a night rather than 3. the ability to send both quotes and invoices on the go saves hours. works extremely well with the paid web app happy as with both
. so simple to use i love tht i can send invoices on the go and accept payments with my phone!!
mark. great app brilliant for out in the field after initial setup.
good on the go. it’s easy to make invoices on the spot for customers and receive payments. i still prefer sitting at a computer but this app really helps while i’m on the go!
low rating until the app supports chart of accounts. the app continues to be under developed for functions that are developed in the web interface. the app is excellent for invoices and credit card transactions if you have a merchant account coupled to your qbo account. the camera can be used in app to document your receipts to the cloud and i use it extensively for hotelairfarerental car expenses and they can be attached to invoices when emailing your customers.
best way to handle your business needs. great app
i'm a fan. i use this app almost daily now. was stuck on my computer and was not will to try it. but happy i did. joe i do accounting in the go. thanks quick books
new business.. very user friendly. almost like apple designed it. very unhappy that the email function doesn’t work. many people have complained for over a year and quickbooks still hasn’t offered a fix😠. i have to take a screenshot and copy and paste to my email. not as professional looking, but gets the job done. that one glitch took away two stars because i can’t use my mobile phone to give someone an invoice or estimate.
good app. nice to have this access on the go. works fine for reviewing status and basic functions.
unusable. stopped working after ios 13 update, can't add expenses and support is unresponsive
great app & program  must improve search engine. fantastic program with brilliant features. it does need some urgent fixes. one being to be able to search through an account such as cash sales and be able to find a name, address or phone number.
it's scam don't download 19.99 per month they took from my account. i just did download almost 8 month ago this app they took from my account almost 19.99 per month after cancel also they are robbing very bad don't download at all even no customer service to help you to talk also bad bad super bad
"cheap. it's one of those slickly apps that pops up in your search result which is filtered to show only free apps. after you waste your time downloading and signing up, it tells you to start your free ""trial""."
. best thing quickbooks has ever done. this is so convenient, i use it more then the actual online. invoicing, printing, emailing.. everything you can do online is available in this app
. changed phone (same number) and have been unable to log into the app since 👎
. amazing app, i literally use it everyday. you need this app if you have your own business.
brilliant app. i have tried a few other invoicing and book keeping apps and had a lot of problems with them. i have been using quick books for nearly a year now, and it's easy, professional and complete. i am very happy with it, and recommend it to everyone. thank you
kewl app. thanks
worst customer support ever. worst customer support in history. using their software and need cs is the best ticket to drive you out of business.
lots of errors.. there are a lot of bugs with qbo, and my accountants have noted errors in the reports. apparently qb is aware but haven't resolved the issues. we have also had numerous glitches in the program  including not being able to log into our account (only being able to log into my accountant's page). this issue has been ongoing for over 18 months without resolution. overall qbo has great potential if it only worked properly.
. very happy with this program an app hats off to u for such an awesome buisness solution
fantastic app in all respects.. i've used quickbooks for over 10 years. it has been great watching them evolve and adapt to the changes in demand and tech. they are ahead of the swell in my opinion
. this app works perfectly for making and sending invoices, addingediting new items, reviewing bills, etc. i haven't figured out how to download an invoice as a packing slip...sometimes i need that function, so have to go to my computer.
great app for managing every business finance needs. i love most of the features available, really great app and ecosystem. this is truly what every startup and business owners should have to manage their business finance. on the cloud and available to use at any time.
just ok. the mobile version is fine. it the desktop version is full of bugs and slow. wastes a lot of my valuable billing time.
disappointing. this is a very unstable product with an unreliable app server. if my accountant didn't require it, i would not use it!
. the app has never been that useful and honestly i feel like quickbooks is losing my favor. now the app won't change the dates on reports. we live in a day in age when i expect to be able to access information when and where i need it, and if i can't count on something then i need to move to something i can count on.
. app crashes a lot. several times after updates are made to the app it will crash after i have to sign in again. now it just crashes after i try to sign in.
love the app. it is amazing to see how well the app learn how to categorize expense! the design and ui are also amazing!
. really easy to set up, very user friendly, loads of useful features.
brilliant app. makes running a business a lot easier.
. force closes all the time. when it won't stop doing it, i have to uninstall and the reinstall. complete bs since i pay for the service.
works great. works great for my small business. not sure why there are bad reviews, qbo keeps up with my customers information, invoices, and estimates. very easy to use. now on this last update, i did have to uninstall and reinstall on my andriod phone, but within 5 minutes i was back up and running.
. very useful app
. this is a good app for keeping track
. this is the absolute worst application. my account has never reconciled. cancelled the subscription. it's worthless.
very beneficial app. this is a very beneficial app. it does not replace the pc version but is an excellent aid. it's helpful to send invoices on the go or at the end of a service call. the sooner the customer gets invoice the more chance i have of getting paid. it is a very good aid!
great. app used to be useless while desktop version did what i needed. now app is highly functional and i use it constantly for my business. great, reasonably priced. i highly recommend.
. it works well for me so far. i have a lot more to learn
. je n'arrive pas à le télécharger!! fini jamais ...... :(
. makes my life easier
thanks for adding banking! now add more control over additional users.. i have been waiting for you to add banking and now you've done it! this is by far the best accounting app i have seen. now i would love to see you add more control over additional users, and a google calendar integration for scheduling.
gloria. unable to create an account. supposedly i already have an account. i've never installed this app before.
helpful app 😊. so far very satisfied with this app. able to record expenses and deposits on the go and quickly. less time spent doing tedious book work. two thumbs up! 👍🏻👍🏻
excellent for the it service provider. as an it service provider, this app allows me to log my hours and mileage in the field. i can even email customer invoices immediately after services are performed. this is, of course, paired with quickbooks online plus, which allows you to log hours per customer. highly recommended!!
paid for subscription but no access. apple says they sent the payment quickbooks says they never received it.... revolving door with neither party willing to help. pay directly through quickbooks if your going to buy.
changes are not good. unable to email with attachments. the older app will not work.
. no expenses apple app has expenses. android does not. somebody please explain me logic of it. android ppl only care to make money? we spend nothing! yey
. what an utter waste of my money for initially subscribing to it. very difficult to use. the questions are complicated when declaring expenses. don't bother using this app better keeping your own ledger!
. 'quick' and easy to use on the go, great app
. a great app. for basic functions, app is good. for full functionality, use a desk top computer for acess for online quickbooks is better to use.
needs a way to attach pdf files, not just pictures. i'd consider this a great app if i could use it to record expense receipts from online purchases (pdf files) , not just printed receipts. i keep having to go back to my computer to record digital receipts. i think it's obvious that folks these days are buying things from amazon and other merchants who provide digital receipts.
i rely on online sync with my external banks. i'm disappointed the subscription i pay for is not mobile. i imagine it would take a lot of programming to include sync on mobile tablets but if it's already hosted on the server, why no access? i'm not a architect but i imagine outsourcing the sync hardware off the tablet you could get your current transactions on mobile . maybe i'm crazy
. makes my life a lot easier... if i could only use this app while not driving down the interstate.. so what, who cares if grandma gets run over by a reindeer, i gotta get paid today..
can't work offline.... mobile tech service. can't work if not in a coverage area on my phone. no receipts for customers or transaction entries. sucks!
senior pastor. excellent app
on point. this app is on point and efficient at helping take care of financial details, needed to avoid tax issues.
what the crap?. great, now i won't be able to use qb on my iphone. guess i'll have to carry my laptop with me everywhere ughhhhhh. is this because i'm on 32bit iphone 5? i refuse to upgrade, please make it work again!!! 😫🐳
. this app works really well. i love that it syncs with web site. i also like being able to take pictures of my receipts and add them to my ledger.
. looks good in theory... bit hard to use and not real keen on all the permissions....
wonderful app!!!. couldn't sing the praises high enough. i run a small, single member managed llc and the quickbooks online app is everything i need. i can create and send invoices and sales receipts on the go, even have the customer sign right on my iphone or ipad.
good app!. add travel tracking to app
can't imagine not using quickbooks!. so much easier that our previous accounts package. so many apps and addons you can build a complete solution what ever business your in.
quick books great program. except logging in is bit harder and not clear.
. idk but its very useful...
. ever since update the app doesn't work & my clients constantly complain about it. especially as it was a feature that sold the software to them in the first place! please sort it out!
. does what you need it to do
quickbooksjoist sync. none of this is working at all. for a company that does bookkeeping it’s ironic that i’ve been charged twice in less than thirty days for a trial period!! none of my invoices are synced, estinates are counted as revenue and quikboojs is stating my 90 day old business has 1000 net profit!! not even remotely possible! this is incredibly frustrating and so i have to work on this on my only day to rest. ridiculous!! do not use this app
. slow load times but good overall
discontinued...... of course vie been using this app for over a year now and has been super handy. lately been having issues so i called qb only to be told it's discontinued now. wonderful.
so easy. this app is user friendly and intuitive. i like being able to see the reports and add attachments to expenses. highly recommended for small businesses owners.
solved my invoicing problems. now i can invoice quickly from anywhere. then track and record payments. very simple yet powerful. love the mobility.
plenty to be desired. there are options such as making expenses billable is not available. previously had issues with adjusting tax in the app and the support team told me to use the web based version. what's the point in having an app with features when the support team just tells you use the web version.
quick books app. it works as good as my computers program! i can do the work i need to right from my phone!
can't imagine not using quickbooks!. so much easier that our previous accounts package. so many apps and addons you can build a complete solution what ever business your in.
crashes after i hit “invoices”. love the app when it works please let me know what the fix is
can't take payments in the app.. new app is working great, but i would love to be able to take a customers payment within this app instead of having to go back and forth between gopayment and quickbooks apps. one of these days. one of see days.
. good basic accounting app but widgets don't seem to work
please fix!!. i have used this app for the last few years for my business and have loved it. this latest update has made the app virtually unusable. it won't let me save an invoice, doesn't show payments made, makes me sign in every time even though i have a pin and the list goes on. very disappointed and hoping this is fixed soon.
amazing app!!!!. love quickbooks and also the app. excellent layout design. just one thing is needed. please allow the app to support touchid for the login process. this would be just the best update ever! thanks
. nice accounting apps.. very usefull..
love the added functionality. i have been using quick books online since it was released. they continue to listen to customers and improve their products. the app is great and can't wait for even more innovative functionality.
. worth every penny. worth it's weight in gold! so thankful as a tiny business owner to have such a powerful, reliable, easy to use, affordable option such as quickbooks! it is truly a blessing to my business and i've only begun to learn all it can dohas to offer!
good program. wish i could see if my estimates were “viewed”, like my invoices.
. sucks...
good for on the go business#. great app for mobile business. lacks some of the functionality of desktop version. i like the way i can record every transaction on the go, even invoices and payments. i don't like the fact that you can run only one business per subscription. much to expensive to pay separate for subscriptions if you have more than one business.
very handy.. life made easier.
great for small business owners.. awesome app. very convenient and keeps the finances and work orders organized. takes some trial and error but well worth the effort to learn this system. you tube has many instructional videos on how to expedite learning this program. price is reasonable for what you get. don't hesitate to get it. if anything you will learn something.
progress billing & payroll. those two items alone differentiate this on line accounting software from all the others. their tech support is always helpful. progress billing is done through projects, it’s getting better, the use ability is getting better. this also allows project costing. 
this is a total disaster. quickbooks online is a complete and total mess. my invoices are duplicating themselves in the register, the register isn't adding correctly, and my sales tax isn't correct so it has to be done by hand. when you call customer service, they have no answers and never bother to return your call because nobody there knows how to fix the issues. i would recommend that nobody ever uses quickbooks online.
". about the only thing this app does real well is it crashes all the time. some features of this app i can't even get to without it crashing. so all said i am able to look up customers but other then that it's useless. i try to use it on a samsung 10"" tablet"
makes it so easy.. it is fast and simple to use. this has been a great addition to my took kit.
. so far total garbage app. i connected my app to my qb online account. i opened the app. snapped 3 receipts. camera worked well isolating the receipts. after that totally useless. despite a new tab appearing in my banking section online i cannot find the receipt copies in either the app or online. i really needed one to return a product. qb cs of no help.
love it!. nuff said
unhappy. bad program for ipad and android phone. bad customer service. very dissatisfied.
problems. what my bookkeeper is finding is payments being applied to the wrong invoices. it’s really messed things up. from the checks being deposited from my bank. also, for some reason my quickbooks is duplicating invoices. i will have to erase the app and download again.
works seamlessly with desktop version. i love that i can use the app to connect with clients while i'm away from my desktop with ease. the ability to send an invoice in the moment has been great to keep me on track while i'm on the go!
good but............... this app needs to have a debit option when adding expenses. also i am really frustrated at this moment, because your app keeps crashing on my ipad. if theses 2 issues are fixed i would give it 10 stars
. zero! the app says it needs to update, then brings me to a screen giving a choice of uninstall or open. if i choose open, i'm back to the need to update. if i uninstall and reinstall, that's just more steps before i'm back to the same useless place. garbage software. update: this was a problem they had seen and were working on. they fixed it and informed me of the fix a few hours later. working now.
. great app.
. love it! i'd love to learn more about how to fully utilize it but it's pretty simple to use. and that very key!
. great app!
very helpful.... there are some glitches with a couple of the features but for the most part, it’s exactly what i need. a great help for record keeping and invoicing my customers efficiently. there should be an option to select and send multiple invoices at once. i have multiple invoices per customer each week.
. running my online business at ease. quickbooks makes it easy to invoice and they take care of calculating your sales tax to pay your state.
not working after ios13 update. updated to apples latest software and this app stopped working
great app. great app. only wish that it had payroll on it.
ok. updates updates and more updates. what’s worse, arriving to a job site and it updating over the cellular network while a customer waits for me to invoice them. no update and it will not work. the concept and functionality is fine.
great app. we use everyday for our company
. great app to get financial control of your business
doesn't have a bank option. they could do much better though it's good
. great app. so easy to add quick receipts and prepare invoices instantly. great for the bookkeeper too and helps keep their fees down also.
. for the entrepreneur on the go, this app is fantastic. i post my expenses with photos of receipts and create invoices from the car! terrific.
. update: no longer freezes but is now saving estimates and invoices multiple time and showing 70k extra in income from invoices and bank deposits which it's now not allowing us to match payments with invoices so our only current option is to delete all duplicate payments and have customers outstanding balances until this is fixed
quick booksamazing app..!. please mail to this id anuhari036@gmail.com excellent app to work...it's really very useful to me...can you please tell how to invoice? thank you quick books for this amazing app!! it's really very helpful..!
. very user friendly and accessible
terrible to customers. your website deleted my account, which i spent hours putting together, and had every intention of subscribing and paying for this service, and then when i spoke with customer service to see what happened, i was told to call two other numbers for the same service, then placed on hold by the final number for 510 minutes, and was hung up on. they had my number and never called me back. horrible service to your customers. i will pursue a different company.
subscription ridiculous. this subscription crap is getting out of hand. what happened to the days when you could buy software and own it? as if quickbooks itself isn't expensive enough, and i would gladly pay once for a quickbooks android app, $125 a year is ridiculous. i don't need your cloud, i have a server of my own, why shove this crap down people's throats?
. it's a great app
. great app...has issues every now and again but easily fixed with tech support!
. great app for managing my business on the go  easy to use!
. this app keeps getting error loading items, to invoice and estimates can't use it. i call them for support and they have no support they referred me to log in on the web site and the same happens the search button flashes and dispensers. don't waste your time and money. if any one know about a good and reliable app let me know. this one is not reliable nor is their support.
great upgrade. great apps. it would be the best, if i was able to enter a bill.
. it wont let me use time activity can u please update it cause we need to use it in the ceild more than at the office
not happy. when i first got the app i fell in love i had problems with the desktop version , with the bank option on the online version witch you removed i was able to log in my transactions very quickly , i would appreciate it if you would please bring back the bank option in the menu asap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
. garbage, won't let you delete your account. it took hours to finally be able to delete email and account, save yourself the hassle and dont download it.
working great. have been using qb for about a year now. has been a great tool for an on the go company like mine. now with the self employed online platform, i might switch up. still looking at which will serve me best. overall great product and customer support gets an a.
no complaints. does the job.
great!. supeper user friendly aloha
. super duper app
. amazing accounting software for small business! highly recommend!
signature doesn't work with ios 9. my signature for my invoices that i need to get paid on no longer works with ios 9. still no update!
inferior to qb online on desktop. qb app on ipad or android does not not have even half of the features that qb online has on a desktop. i can manage basic invoicing, basic expenses, see transactions, and pull up basic reports... everything about this app is basic. i have to actually be on my desktop to access the full features of qb online. very dissapointed.
. great app, much easier to invoice customers.
love it. well i love this app. i never thought bookkeeping could be this fun and easy. thanks for making the program
crashes a ton. this is a great app for bookkeeping for my business, but it crashes almost daily on my iphone. please get better engineers for the functionality of this app!! so frustrating when i’m in the middle of printing invoices and the app crashes! how am i supposed to conduct business that way!?!
. great app use it to submit all quotes and review estimates
not working on ios 13 :(. it crashes right after opening. i tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but have had no luck...
. this app helps me keep my clients in order and helps me to keep up with payments.
. the service is phenomenal. when my wife took over the company books, she knew nothing about quick books. i gave her the number for service and they were talking all of the time. now she knows what is going on and slaps my handsfor making a bad entry!
q books. i love this app it's very useful
. great app to managing income and expenses
tremendous time saver. i rarely login to quickbooks online any more and have never looked back from switching from the full desktop version. the mobile app is a tremendous time saver and allows be to better server my clients.
. problem tried to sync my company data, refresh it. and now the app crashes as it is loading my company invoices. it seems to log in fine. just gets hung up when trying to load. was working great at the end of last year. but now it won't work....please help! i was using the app a lot. just want it to work again. p.s. i am using a galaxy s4 android 4.3 thanks!
couldn't ask for more. vary good app with great integration with cloud web service. i have been using this app along with desktop cloud version with my business for little more then a year now and find it vary useful and the app tops it off being on the road with no access to computer as long as they continue to upgrade and offer quickbooks online with app i will subscribe
failure......again. when will quickbooks get their act together???? touch id to log in is gone with this update, still a lot of features from desktop version are missing. don't like the idea that the user has no control on the data and backups.
latest version is a disaster. face recognition does not work at all. you have to sign in every time you open the app and often get kicked out especially when switching between companies. colossal waste of time.
. loved it, but acting up again. when i add something to an invoice (on s8) then hit done, the refreshed invoice lines are all out of order and duplicated. uninstalled and reinstalled, still doing it. not working on tablet either. please fix asap. update: seems to be fixed now. thank you
. very good no problems with it.
. very useful and easy to use on the go. price friendly too
. great but limited awesome for invoices and receipts. can't manage reports or banking.
mobile app. convenient and easy too use!
not complete functionality.. this app doesn't have the full functionality of the website, so when i'm on my tablet, i just use the website instead of the app.
n entendi nd. tenho 17 anos, nao entendi nd, sou burra ou esse app é ruim? talvez a primeira opção, mas de qq forma n gostei
. great for beginners
. fairly easy to use for quick access. i use the online version to enter expenses and income.
. the app has been having system errors & technical difficulties since january. why? my credit card is still being charged monthly fees and the product that im being charged for isn't working. your system is broken & flawed. please cancel subscription and refundcredit my card back. i would really appreciate it. i'm not interested in speaking to another rep. refund...
. great app. no issues
powerful bookkeeping in your hand.. fantastic program to track costs, expenses, create invoices and it's all done to generally accepted accounting principles.
. great app. can be used on the go as well so very convenient.
no more receipts in my pocket. shoot the receipt and record the transaction, now even more quickly with touchid
worst app ever ! not reliable. been using qb for may years, the last few years have been tough for them. we use our mobile app constantly, but it has many issues. it constantly crashes and some day it just won't open. not acceptable. we have taken to customers service many times, but the problems still persist. i get it growing pains right ? is just too much. we are looking for an alternative software like cero. sad but qb get 1 star .
just what i needed. i run a small contractor business doing remodel work. the mobile app has been a godsend. i can track all my estimates, invoices & expenses in one place. helps me track clients that are late payers too (which sometimes happens). i like it. 100% worth the subscription
. makes up time, and easier to keep up with.
. great program once you get used to using it👍
. app crashes a lot. several times after updates are made to the app it will crash after i have to sign in again. now it just crashes after i try to sign in.
lousy service. spent all morning trying to upload an expense only to be told i had no internet connection. can't it determine i have no server connection? so most of the morning i spent in one que after another and finally hanging up. i must say that the convenience of being mobile outweighed the inconvenience of not having too much versatility, but only if i am able to be mobile. i hate wasting time, and so i want payback.
great but.... very great app. i rated three stars because you can’t enter employee time from your mobile device. i know it’s a mobile app but you should be able to enter time . i understand that mobile apps are a little different but this seems like a simple task that should be possible. i send invoices and estimates all the time with the mobile app other than that it’s a great app. will update rating when these features are added
if it wasn’t broken, it would be much better.. when i launch this app on any of my devices, i get an error in the app that says “unable to get all of your quickbooks data pull down to refresh your page.”
love this app and online version of qb 😬. i converted to the online version of qb from the desktop version and i have to say it was the best decision i made! my primary laptop crashed & nothing could not be recovered, the online version of qb was never an issue & continued seamlessly. this app is such a convenient perk to qb  i can't say enough how fabulous this app is. love it!
. love the app. as a quickbooks proadvisor the app help me keep up with clients while on the go..
buggy. since updating to the latest version i can’t view invoices from the home screen or even update and send invoices from the invoices screen. hire some competent engineers.
. everytime i try to log in i get an error! i've restarted and uninstalled and it still won't work
better than nothing. can't access all that i need to access on this app.
horrible app even if subscribing!. subscribe to the app yet they want me to pay for a new subscription, waste of money for months!
freelance developer. works great to record expenses and keep a copy of receipts.
. apparently i don't know my password or id, yet i just used the exact same login details to login on my pc... level of angry right now is fairly high
good for the $$$ needs more features. need to be able to write and view purchase orders from the app. also be able to see the cost of inventory items. not just list price
. the service online is terrific. the app errors anytime i try to update from my smartphone for over a month now. support is unresponsive via email.
sage. there are far too many bugs for my business to depend on this. what is really more important than dependability in book keeping software? besides there are very limited features to begin with.
not updating. my receipts and income is stuck.
please fix. 1. when creating an estimate or invoice you can not add the project location. 2. also i have an item for notes on my estimates which should not show any price numbers (0.00) 3.i can not edit the way estimates  invoices look. i try it in android and apple both apps have the same problem. if you fix that the app will be perfect.
qb makes me look good. qb app is fantastic. i can write and present an estimate right at the job site or give my customer an invoice, or accept payment. in brief....it makes me look good!
doesn't send invoices. my customers stopped receiving invoices from me via email. i have to send it to myself and forward to them. customer service is a joke: they think their clients are stupid, their advices are just ridiculous: are you sure you put the email in the right section? really? i had been sending invoices via email before and they all received them.
very limited. don't expect to come close to the alreadylimited function set of the desktopbrowser version. a real disappointment.
useful but limited. useful but definitely not as many features as the web version.
employees. was charge $30 for three months for payroll, which i was not using. called the payroll department and they took care of me: refunded the cash into my account without question.
very helpful. i love this app it allows me to run my business easily
. doesn't work on my dell tablet. called customer support in january and they said software glitch should be fixed in two weeks. it's been two months and still not working!
excellent program. i have tried office and unless you no the formulas it doesn’t work. absolutely love how easy this is!
opens the closes. after the last update of quick books i can not access it on my ipad. there for it is costing me money. i hit the app it opens the closes right back. i have uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it is the same thing. i have 3 jobs i did today that i could not take payment on because of this. please fix asap
quickbooks online app a+. app is very easy to use, even people without lots of knowledge in bookkeeping can manage their small business with quickbooks online through the app.
great app!. this app is so convenient for my type of work. it would be nice to have a few more features like search for more then just a customers name. maybe an address or phone number. i expect it to come in future updates. thanks again!
. good app. allows me to do all things necessary for my business on the go
excellent. j ai fait l essai d un mois et je suis conquis ! très bonne application très complète et simple à customiser  la fonction liée au comptes est aussi très pratique m évite de recopier toutes mes dépenses à la main
. lousy app, it takes forever to just delete a picture from the app, send email to customers etc etc. so many bugs crawling in it. fix it man.
awesome!. has worked better than any other accounting software i have ever used!
gr8 system. for some one that's all thumbs and prehistoric to technology i found quickbooks not only easy and user friendly, but its approach to my business is so easy to follow, it's almost transparent.... heaps better than myob. and i speak from experience......
so happy. awesome app
doesn’t keep track of suppliers. this app works fine as long as you only want to send novices. unfortunately it doesn’t tell what you owe your suppliers and allow you to pay their bills, so while you are running around invoicing clients the suppliers will be sending the bailiffs round to your office.
. pretty good overall..a free bits missing such as receive payment straight to bank account but after a few years resisting online i'm now a fan!
. had it for only 6 hours and gave up! it's not that easy to use! wasted my money!
app doesn't work at all. after attempting to log in several times the app crashes every time. i cannot rely on it for work so it's useless.
. its very good program keeping my books in order, reminding of unpaid invoices connects to external management software, great stuff
rubbish with ipad. awful user experience working on ipad. and no consistency with menu options when using mobile and web app. it’s like using 2 different applications.
. zero! the app says it needs to update, then brings me to a screen giving a choice of uninstall or open. if i choose open, i'm back to the need to update. if i uninstall and reinstall, that's just more steps before i'm back to the same useless place. garbage software.
. bank feeds never update. been telling me to check back in a couple of hours for 3 days. resync doesn't work. completely useless without updated banking information. uninstalling and never returning. stick to the web browser bc this app is a waste of my time and space!
. very poor and limited app. information displayed is quite different from the web view. i only want to see one thing  supplier invoices and outstanding balances and this app doesn't show them.
excellent!!!. this is easy to use and very convenient! most of the functionality on the app means it's easy to work while out of the office!
easy to use. great app. very happy with it
terrible across the board. quickbooks online needs a lot more research and development. continuously enters double entries from link bank account. does not enter feeds uptodate like it says it is going to
efficace. je suis seul dans mon entreprise et ce service me permet de créer et consulter n’importe où mes factures et autres éléments. l’interface smartphone est géniale en ce qui me concerne.
quickbooks mobile app crashes continuously, unusable. the quickbooks mobile app crashes continuously and is totally unusable in it’s current condition on ipad. frustrating and we are planning to switch accounting app companies, after years with quickbooks program. intuit seems unconcerned with fixing the problem that has been plaguing our recordkeeping for weeks now.
great but needs improvement. app is really great other then one key thing missing. i need access to employees and doing payruns while on the go and be able to enter in employees hours for casuals with ease.
great app. love this app. it makes running my business easier.
i like it. just started using on the ipad pro and working smoothly so far. easy and quick to switch between multiple companies in the qb app.
. happy to be able to bookkeeping on the go. use my time waiting dr offices etc classifying banking transactions and miles. loaves the new reciept capture. hoping the newest update lets me do bank deposits via the app. wish the reciept and banking input allowed for inventory line items like their desktop version i used before converting to online.
worst app ever ! not reliable. been using qb for may years, the last few years have been tough for them. we use our mobile app constantly, but it has many issues. it constantly crashes and some day it just won't open. not acceptable. we have taken to customers service many times, but the problems still persist. i get it growing pains right ? is just too much. we are looking for an alternative software like cero. sad but qb get 1 star .
easy to use. its very convenient to be able to run my business on my cell phone
touch id fail. qb  please fix the touch id feature. it's useless.
. still very much a novice, but love learning qbo as i go
. really good app to use for small businesses
. can't seem to input expense reports with the app
. last update made my app work. great job! samsung galaxy s2 sprint epic touch 4g.
great app!. i can operate from my cell phone and know where i stand in my finances while on the go! great app.
. best way to keep books. great way to run reports and see profits and losses
limited features. i’m not sure why quickbooks decided to create an app that is so much different than the web version or the mac version. errors and limited information is all this thing is good for. and, if you decide you would rather just use the website, you pretty much get redirected to this junky app.
better than sage. with a properly functioning mobile app, square integration & receiptexpense management, 10 times easier to use than sage(simply accounting)
. i only gave it a stare so i could write a review! there are hidden fees and bad customer service! i will not recommend this system ever!!!!!!!!!!!!
um not to quick. over all i like it but there are just a few things i can't do in the app like remove invoices.
. it works great on my phone, and tablet. i'd recommend it to other people that use quickbooks if it could be used. i use it constantly, but would use it all the time with a tablet. it sometimes has issues with launching. i've had reinstallrelaunch several times.
. mobil app to slow
. what a joke......the sales team are so rude....software is actually pretty good but the attitude of the staff in th sales team have completely put me off using this! i will now be looking elsewhere (fresh books etc).....
. so far this app is working very well for me and i have not had any problems as of yet
touchid barely works. this is a slightly less clunky way of entering new invoices, etc than using the quickbooks website on a phone. but the touchid function barely works. at best, once enabled, it remembers the setting for three or four logins, but then asks for the password again. very poor.
. info lost. i was using the service for my business last year and started in march. in november the app crashed. when it did all my saved receipts mileage and info was lost. i can't even login any longer. when i called they said there is no support for the app except online. so i cant even speak to a rep. so all my info gone and i'm still being charged for a year and a half now for a service that never existed.
does not function. doesn't load new invoices. app is now useless.
. worst customer service ever.
. would be better if it used ai to fill in some of the receipt details
great app would be useful to do bills on it though. reminder email doesn't work on app
was enjoying it until ios13 update. this app was working fine until i updated to ios13...... boom! nothing now. crashes on opening everytime.
. this is seriously a great app. thanks devs
kevin morton. easy. not using any other software.
great app!. for a business that is always on the go this is an awesome app! i love that i can work anywhere!
. the app has stopped working on my phone, i've been trying to log in for 2 weeks now and it constantly said the internet isn't connected, which it is. have sent an email via your contact details abs had no response regarding this issue.
crashes since update. i've tried to create a twoline invoice repeatedly since the update, and it crashes every time. will update review when it works.
update???. aren't things supposed to get betterlol
updates. need more updates on the apps because i always have to go to my laptop to do certain things not like in that
. excellent app
". i laughed at one of the quickbooks employees response to the app being slow... they said their goal is to make it as convenient as the qbo app... lol lol bad comparison. online version is tragically slow, short of (what should be) obvious capabilities, even some quickbooks older versions have had for years. and, when challenged, their tech support essentially says ""we are quickbooks if you don't do it our way or using our workaround then you must be doing it wrong"""
dont work no more. terrible tech support! app quit working over a month ago...tech support is useless...you better change your advertising....you should probably get it for false advertising cause you are lying to the public
. top app easy to use.
. fix sales tax to enable for existing customers!
great for small business. i run a small business mostly through through etsy. this is a great program to keep track of finances. the only thing i wish is it would integrate paypal here payments like it does square. it would be amazing if it could do the same with etsy. alas, i have to type them in by hand. i love the integrate on my iphone, ipad and macbook. it is very streamlined.
. great app
tremendous time saver. i rarely login to quickbooks online any more and have never looked back from switching from the full desktop version. the mobile app is a tremendous time saver and allows be to better server my clients.
very limited!. i prepare weeks of invoices on my desktop for my 3 crews. unfortunately the online version rarely finds the invoices, and i end up having to go back to the old way of exporting pdf invoices. i feel like the desktop has so many flaws already, and the app is basically a worse version. i expect more from a legit company, but maybe i'm asking too much.
great app for any small business. this is a well polished app with regular updates and new features being added everyday. *credit card transactions are incredibly simple with the intuit gopayment integration. great job on the app guys keep up the good work!
recent update. thursday i updated my ios, then updated the app. it’s now crashing after sign in. please fix this, my phone is a xr
. i love this app
no true inventory integration. so intuit is apparently letting the vultures take it on this one with letting a third party company charge you a hundred and forty on top of the $40 per month for plus... intuit should include a nice inventory app with qbop, i'm saying everything from being able to put a cost of goods that you put materials into an inventory item to taking pictures of items. where's the mobile support????
qb app is useless. i’ve been quickbooks user for a long time and discovered this app gives a totally different set of numbers than quickbooks online does. expenses are different than real version so please beware, you can’t trust the numbers. contacted support to no avail. i guess they don’t read the other reviews either.
email is my only complaint i don't like my emails coming from into it i want to choose my own email so my customers can respond please fix this. respond it's when i'm sending invoices or estimates
keeps getting more user friendly!. the new video tutorials make it easy to learn. the portability of switching between the mobile app and the desktop version online is a priceless feature, thanks for all of your hard work!
. great app
update needed asap. i also have been using this app for years (it’s great when working properly) but something happened after this last update and i’m getting kicked off and signed out in the middle of my invoices and estimates. it’s staying “an important update is required” or something like that and i’ll go to update the app but it’s already updated! and i’ll log back into the app and get kicked off again with the same message.....
great product. i couldn't be happier with this app is the best of the best, probably the purchase i ever done for my business
. app filho da p#@.. n sai da parte de criar conta
ios 13 problems fixed very quickly.. quickbooks is pretty good, the online version is fantastic. issues are attended to quite quickly. from a small business point of view, i simply can’t fault it.
tonya pitchford. app and product are useless for my particular business. very hard to deal with, fees are high
great system easy to use. i really like the online version better than the windows. the app is easy to use i highly recommend this app quick books has completely changed the way i run my business. every thing is so organized and neat now. i don't lose recipes any more. witch is a plus the total functionality of the system is great.
stop trying to make mileage tracking happen, it's not going to happen.. it's fine to ask me *once* if i would like to track mileage through the app. it's *not* okay to ask every time i open the app. it's not a service i need, it's not a service i use. stop shoving it in my face and stop asking me to use it.
good app and great support. easy to use although experienced problem with vat rate not being editable in online desktop version. intuit' response was really quick and efficient and friendly. highly recommend.
we need an update for iphone x. we need an update for iphone x. in addition, we need the function to add cc recipient when sending out quotes or invoices. other than those 2 things, it is good.
not working. great app when it works which is 1% of the time between it crashing and freezing i cringe every time i have to use it on the road
great fing app!!. i love this app, everything syncs over so well from the web version. it's very simple to use and makes my job a hell of a lot easier!!
. this app is good and easy to use.
easy and user friendly. i have been using for 5 years
. easy to navigate
. good software
unusable in ios 13. after login, app crashes every time. i tried deleting and reinstalling as well. ios 13.0. please fix asap.
a poor mobile companion to qbo. there are so many things wrong with this app. for example, expenses have a note field that doesn't show notes entered in qbo (web). the length of the expense category field is so short that i can't distinguish among categories, especially nested ones. the app generally lacks the functionality it would need to make it a truly useful companion to qbo.
great software. few issues lots of results this product is easy to use and reduces time spent in the office its mobility is my favorite part use with my phone tablet laptop and desk top devices payment network nice but a little pricey
not working. app will not open on iphone 6 plus
can't match bank transactions reliably. the only reason i use this app is to match bank transactions when i have some 'down' minutes. lately, they keep getting kicked back to me, so i have to match them on my pc anyway. also, you don't have access to both memo and description, so your notes don't appear in reports if you add the transaction though a bank connection.
. qbo is the best accounting software ever! the only feature missing from the app is payroll which i would really like.
. great accounting software
. nice app
great app. real nice app
down graded. from april this app is unusable. i down graded to qb online. it appears it was released about a year too soon. nothing but frustration from day one. the ipad and iphone is useless.
awesome!. easy and simple to use!
one man show. this app helps tons: estimate and invoice from anywhere.
great for the business owner on the go. i love this app. it allows me to stay in the know with all of my offices finances.
. easy to use and useful across all devices.
hair kreations. simple, fast and reliable
. game changer. invoicing and tracking expenses just got so easy. it's amazing, and i am only sad i didn't know about it sooner!
unbelievable and easy to use. saved me hours rectifying between bank and invoices. amazing phone service
. perfect tool. easy to learn and use it
. i can see my subscription for months. click to manage subscription and i am told i have none. haven't used thus app but have been paying for months. help
well done. good app to compliment online services
can’t create pos in app. wish i could create pos in the app. we use qb online with shopify. i can only create a po to send to my distributor from my desktop. i am often away from my desktop, in order to send a p.o. from my phone i have to log on to the regular online edition through safari. i cannot use the app as i need it to function.
great for billing while traveling. this app is very hearty. i was worried how it would work from the ipad but it was so easy. let's me bill while i'm on the road so that i can keep my cash flow in order. great job, inuit!
amazing customer service. i have needed assistance twice this last month in redesigning my invoices. both the agents that helped me truly seemed more like friends then a rep. both were very knowledgeable, patient and extremely helpful. now i am actually enjoying my quickbooks instead of grumbling every time i use it. happy customer, karen velasquez, owner of see through services
quickbooks made simple. though i'm still not totally familiar with qb in general the app definitely makes it much easier and convenient to use and track accounts activity etc.
adding a photo to a receipt should be simple. apparently there was a recent update that removed the add photo option to tranasactions. it's not there any longer. i called support and they tell me i have to create a note, add the photo to that note, then go find the transaction and add the note to it.
great!!!. i love this app i love qbo what else is there to say. recent update created tons of issues with ios 9.3.3 some glitches evolved not sure who's fault but hope they get fixed. i appear to get error messages entering my expenses :(. can't save invoice created either please fix. otherwise when the app works it's great one star is its current state.
. crashes again and again
i am truly loving this app. been hunting for a simple app for managing the finances of my farm business. this helps me with capturing and analysis of all my expenses and income. the reporting is also amazing. i also love the fact that i can even get more stats and reports via the web. amazing stuff. already introduced it to quite a number of industry colleagues. truly an amazing app
crashing. app keeps crashing every time i click on it!
. website offers single sign on (sso) with google (sign in with google), but the app expects a username and password. 1 star for overlooking your login system, rendering it completely unusable. oops?
won't save receipts. try to record receipts in expenses, just get error message. called the number the message had, person they don't offer support for mobile devices or their app.**** update i did as you requested the day you requested and to date have not heard back from your staff. same issue with samsung 10.1 tablet and s6 phone.
. quickbooks online has been great, downloaded this app to make life quicker when not in the office. however, for expenses i have found it unusable as the same payment methods i am using online are not available on the app and therefore it messes up the consistency of my transactions. very disappointed as had high hopes, have yet to test the differences whilst invoicing.
the best app out there by far. the app is excellent for anyone on the go. easy to upload info from the app. user friendly. tried a few other book keeping apps and found this to be the best by far. every update includes a very useful useable option. 👌🏽👌🏽
great but how do i renew?. it says i need to renew or pay? i hit ok and try to go to the spot i need to but don't see anything. smthis happened while trying to make someone a receipt in person.
poorest customer service i’ve ever experienced. wow quickbooks has done it again making key changes without customer notification changes leave me hanging with no ability to do business then phone calls to customer service are long waits. must be effecting a whole lot of customers just a simple email or cs agent phone call might help. but the changes for worse again. seriously poorest service ever!!
. update... application remains impossible to use on both ios and android devices. invoice matching for banking transactions is painful particularly when there are many invoices to match to a single banking transaction and application seems to refresh in the background which causes matches to be lost before completing. not worth installing till these issues are fixed meaning web based invoice matching is the only option... have wasted hours of my time on both ios and android based applications...
hassled. having a negative experience trying to connect bank account. tried the right credentials and still not getting anywhere. waste of time.
does not work. quickbooks will not let me access via my mobile device, neither through my browser or through this app. figure it out guys, smart phones are the most common computers people use these days...
poor. say they can transfer info from sage into there software, no they can’t if you use stock codes what a waste of time.
nothing works for me. nothing works for me with this app. if i login using desktop, qbo is ok but when i use the app, there is no information; no clients, no invoices, nothing. the subscription says i have a free trial until 2037. phone support was unsuccessful.
it's very nice app. nice aap, now i can mange company whole activity
junk update = worthless app. since the latest update, my qb app shows an error saying that my session has expired immediately after i log in. i can't use it at all. pc access is okay.
user. good app but needs more features
app keeps crashing. even when i try to leave feedback the app crashes. no issues on desktop.
". i scanned several receipts and submitted them through the app. they were confirmed by the app as ""added"". half of them are now missing with no explanation of where they went. those receipts were already disposed of. completely unacceptable."
app doesn't show anything. the app version does not match the online quickbooks. most of the information is not accessible in the app.
latest app update. this update is terrible basically unusable please change it back asap
underdeveloped & terrible support. the software is totally undeveloped and does not have the features of the regular desktop version. tech support is horrific, they can't help because they don't have the knowledge. intuit had no business releasing the software to the public it's not even ready for beta yet. the iphone app is worthless!
makes my life easier. there are a few things that i am still getting used to, but overall love it. i have used the desktop version of quickbooks for five years. this allows more mobility with my phone and tablet. i have already recommended it to a friend. looking forward to learning more!
. works great. i still have a lot to learn.
qbol. great app!
handy for sole trader. some things aren’t available on the app, like editing your invoices.
quick and easy. had a few teething issues getting used to the system, but i fund it easier to work and the app makes it easy to take shots of receipts to add electronic records
"don't bother. it says above ""get full access to everything quickbooks online has on the web"". but in fact it is a totally different application geared to salesmen on the road. don't expect to see your accounts here, all you have is:  customers  estimates  your invoices and sales receipts. very disappointing; forget it"
exceptional. this is incredible intuitive software that keeps you completely up to date. it saves hours of time. this is very easy to use. highly recommend for every business owner.
can’t use properly  soooo slow. i can’t use qbo app properly, the application is so slow, unable to load my data on my mobile (wifi lte network)
. very handy for on the go small business tasks
very easy to use. this app is extremely easy to use and very helpful.
convenient but with glitches. while adding transactions from bank register, transactions get duplicated and doubled.
. zero! the app says it needs to update, then brings me to a screen giving a choice of uninstall or open. if i choose open, i'm back to the need to update. if i uninstall and reinstall, that's just more steps before i'm back to the same useless place. garbage software. update: this was a problem they had seen and were working on. they fixed it and informed me of the fix a few hours later. working now.
efficient. does all the work, and reminds me to collect on overdue invoices. i love it! not very expensive either!
". app for android stinks. only loads a few visible parts and if you try to update an invoice, originally entered on the desktop, it will ""zero out"" the parts not found on the app (causing invoicing discrepancies). ayou also can't upload attachments to invoices (which i use frequently in my business). until intuit can make their app consistent with the desktop version it is unusable for mobility."
keeps crashing. i absolutely love this app...but since ios 13 install every time i go to use it, it crashes. i sent an email to support but need this rectified. once that glitch is fixed it’s a 4.5 star app!
love it. my entire business is conducted through my iphone. thanks qb for making life so easy!!! greatest app for any small business, hands down!!!
this product is fantastic!. i will be recommending this to all of my customers. it's simple, easy to use & fast to set up. in fact it may feel like you've missed something it's that simple! intuit have put together a great product for the australian market.
old version was better. the functionality of being able to invoice on the go is great but the reports were much better in the old version. used to be able to easily click who owes me and who i owe. wish this had the company snapshot report as a report option.
confusing. i used the trial a little while ago, and sort of went off it. just renewed the subscription now with the exact the same email, but quickbooks somehow created a new company instead! the support for backing up the company’s data is all over the place, since there are so many variants of the softwareapp.
crashes w ios 9. app crashes after you enter password. intuit has had 3 months to test on beta. customer service has no idea what ios 9 is.
owner. quickbooks online, so far we like everything about except for the fact that it works like crap on an ipad. please come out with an update and patch work soon it's not worth it.
. great app
a great app. this has revolutionised my business. saving me hours of admin every week.
. this app works great on my computer but will not allow you to accept deposits on a mobile device.
great for mobile services. i'm a computer technician and i use this to send a invoice or estimate for clients. quickbooks has a brand name which is good when you email your clients a invoice, it looks very professional. the best thing about this app is the cloud base syncing of your invoice, clients, income and expenses. it's worth the money if you want good quality invoices for your clients.
slow to update. pretty useless app.
user friendly. quickbooks has saved me so much time and stress! i have a small business and tried excel and failed miserably. but when i switched to quickbooks it took me no time to figure out it could do everything i needed and more! also the customer service is wonderful, anytime i have called for help because i'm terrible at technology they walk me through step by step without making me feel stupid. i'm so happy i switched to quickbooks!!!
flawless. first app that i've used that really hasn't had any problems at all. i do most on my computer but this is nice to have in case you're in a jam
changed my life for the (much) better!. want to send an estimate in the time that it takes your barista to make your coffee? the amount of time that i save managing my business on my phone has cut my desktime in half. i couldn't be happier!
makes my job easier as a small business owner. makes my job easier as a small business owner
intuit keeps working it but stumbles on occasion. i've been a qbo user for over 4 years now and run my whole oneman business on it. each app version is a bit better than the last and they do fix bugs when notified. i continue to be happy to see intuit continue to improve the app and the web interface. the blanking of bank account data in the dashboard appears to be fixed in v5.3.
. app takes forever to load on my one plus 5t. will not load banking feed to organize payment catagories. man, for how much we pay for this service, you would think it would have a rocking app....
love it. love it. the version on my computer is great. this app is a little unintuitive but if you understand what you're doing it's not bad!
okay. i'm new to doing my own bookkeeping and find this product clunky and not very easy to use. issues with importing transactions and program changing dates and the order compared to the bank. it's not very easy to see what account transfers are moving tofrom. it's hard to distinguish credits for debits. poor customer service. no good summary graphs. slow to attach receipts. multiple clicks to do basic things. cuts off file names if there too long.
brilliant app with loads of features!. so easy to use. so easy to learn. instant bank feeds. invite your accountant & bookkeeper & other users. so much support from intuit & the australian team. what's not to like? intuit have put together a great product for the small to medium business owner. thoroughly recommend this product.
emailing. emailing invoices is not operating today!
makes accounting much simpler. i've been using this app for a few months and find it to be really easy and accommodating. the app when used in conjunction with my desktop program helps to alleviate a lot of ambiguity and oversight.
great, but can learn from others. just my observations: mobile app should be mostly used to record expenses. it lacks ocr tracing. moreover scanning a receipt is a multistep process. should add forcetouch to add receipt (open in camera). invoices: been searching how to add my banking information. cannot believe quickbooks does not allow for adding banking information to invoices. did i miss something? or is it a hidden feature? not very intuitive (pun intended). otherwise good. like the integration with bank account.
great app !!!. very easy to use and understand.
. i love this app i love this app even more now because i'm able to bill my customers almost as soon as i am done the work.
fantastic app for small business. i have been using quickbooks for a year now. before i used to use myob and it used to cost me double what i pay now. it has all the features i need and usually works without any problems. i can write up quotes onsite, and send invoices before i leave the job. i highly recommend this app for small businesses.
great app. keeps us so much more connected with our customers
. would be nice if the app would recognize the info on the receipt when you take a pic of it
. the worst!!!! i switched to a new phone and now it doesn't recognize my user name and password. it even allowed me to change the password and then wouldn't recognize the new one. called twice to resolve the problem. first time, 35 minute wait and hung up. 2nd time 40 minute wait, hung up. i will be canceling my subscription and looking for a quality competitor who values customer service. what a shame!
perfect for my small business. i am a wedding photographer and quickbooks online is the best way for me to keep track of my expensesrentals and write up a quick invoice or estimate while i am on the road. i absolutely love how user friendly it is. as long as i have my smart phone i can work from anywhere.
perfect. for what i need this application is absolutely perfect. saves a lot of messing around creating an invoice in word and then sending it ... great app !!
great app. this is getting better with each update it makes. i you this app everyday to run my practice and it makes it very convenient because i'm constantly on the road and i don't have to sit at my desk just to enter expenses or send invoices to clients.
dissapointed. this is the frontline of my business as i am a mobil service technician. app no longer will save or complete an invoice. this is crippling my business! fixxxxxx please immediately!
. great app for invoicing and tracking expenses
easy to use. quick books is very easy to use and i am able to finish my bookkeeping on the go when i am on the train or waiting in an airport.
great for small business. i decided to use quickbook for my small busy because i wanted something better than excel. i glad i did. this is a great way to keep a business going.
fairly useless. this app is difficult to navigate. it doesn't come close to mimicking qbo for pcs. the functionality is very limited. it's ok for looking up some things but difficult to update info such as logging checks or deposits.
awful. bloody slow!!
this app is a need!. this app makes running a side buisness so easy and convenient that you can do nothing but make a profit! love this app dont change a thing
could be better. still no auto save. it’s 2018 folks, time to wake up. does not perform the same on my phonetablet as my desktop. i.e automated emails on my desktop autofill my clients name, my phone does not. on my desktop i can switch the order of items on my invoices and estimates, on my phone i cannot. the simple editing features are extremely important on a device that smaller than my hand.
simple + effective. much better than the online and desktop tools available. super accessible, easy to use, and simple interface and controls. 55 stars.
. best app
very handy  will stop the boss bugging me!. good app for the boss to have. super easy to check on customers invoices overdue etc. would like to see timesheet daily activity integration please  perhaps with a contollable daily multiple nag me to enter times feature? with timesheet integration i could roll this out to other staff :) cheers!
great program!. very easy to use!
. my app has stopped working on my samsung s9 for 2 days in a row. you should have sent an email to inform subscribers if your app is going to be experiencing a downtime.
won't open. i use this app daily and now it won't open! please fix this!
. while logging in it says app features from android in india is not available try from the web
awful. iphone app pretty much unusable in the real world. always wants to be signed in each time you open it, touch id feature doesn't work. today it's complaining the app needs to be updated before i use it, it then directs me to the app store where it shows i already have the latest version!
can't find internet?. every time i try to log in i get an error message that there is no internet to connect to which is bull. it's on my cell phone so there's wifi and data. very disappointed.
. very slow on mobile
not easy to do it all on app. find trying to complete and send vat return a headache. also we use coop bank doesn’t tie up with qb nor does it with starling business bank
great except one thing.. i like everything except when the app times out while i’m trying to save an invoice that took me 5 minutes to write up!! and no when it does that it doesn’t save the invoice. other than that it’s good.
excellent app. i used to use invoice2go and since moving to quick books online it makes everything so much easier i can sync to my bank accounts and this itself is saving me time reconciling is a breeze now.
unable to sync. all i get is errors about syncing. different phones. same problem. works great in my ipad, though!
very convenient and usable. great app that connects me too my work platform everywhere i go!!
. excellent app.
useless. i am an avid qbo for ie customer for many years, but this ipad app is useless. can't do anything with it, and can not see banking info, the most important thing in accounting! if you want to view customervendor names that can be done, but you can't work in this app. view only.
. exelent app!!! excellent app it works for my small business if one tech and one office lady.i just can't figure out how to add small items i use to repair i.e. couplings tees nineties and what they fall under. other than that i love this app.
"error. i dont even understand why massage always popup said ""failed to connect with server"" when everytime tried to login using this app..send several of email to support team but theres no answer n solution..please do something i am a quickbooks online plus subscriber.."
. this website is terrible and the customer service is friendly yet not helpful!!! i want to cancel my subscription and yet told to remove the app from my tablet....wrong by removing the app it does not cancel my subscription...very unhappy!!
needs work. this app has a lot of functionality, but lacks consistancy with the web version. as it is today, i can't send an invoice from this app which looks the same as i send from the web version. if what the customer sees becomes consistant i could give more stars.
lot of scope for improvement. finding a lot difficult to access even the simple features like search etc. hopefully the updates will take care of it.
total scam. i do not have the ability to open this app but somehow you have been able to continue to bill my credit card monthly. i cancelled a credit card because you have no contact info. sites to cancel service by. somehow you have gotten ahold of my new cc info!!! cancel this service now!!!!
broken. can’t save any new invoice sales receipt... ipad pro iphone xs max nothing works
. love it! makes my accounting software much easier. no time wasting and sent direct to the customer and most times get paid straight away. fabulous!
improvements. 1) stock quantity should be displayed in the app 2) round off amount space in invoice
. can't add charges would get 5 stars if i could add charges (to be invoiced at a later time), but the mobile app doesn't seem to allow for this
. very convenient app. makes business much easier.
slowly losing my business. i'm about tired of this app not functioning properly. embarrassing to say the least when i have a customer trying to pay their bill and i can't even connect to quickbooks online server. none of your apps are working as advertised. $25month for what again?
it takes some getting used to. you need to link your accounts. once you have done that, you have to remember all your accounting practices. posting entries is simple once you have done the required steps. few more weeks and i will be caught up for the year. i like it!!
. i used the app mainly to create invoices when i'm out of the office. it's so awesome to be able to do this on the fly!
. easy to use.i make work much easier. however, i cant enter a supplier bill. only as an expence
. love this app, easy to use and reasonable priced
great app for small business!. i love being able to enter my expenses and invoices from my phone. very convenient and makes tax time much easier!
needs improvement. i just started using this app while traveling. it doesn’t compare to the site on my pc. very unfriendly and difficult to impossible to bring up to date.much incomplete data. need to go to work on this one of its to be useful.
. loads, then crashes. uninstalled and reinstalled, and still crashes upon open. fingerprint doesn't work anymore. frustrating.
easy, fast, convenient. love using this app! it is really easy to navigate and lets me do everything i need to very quickly. always in sync no matter which device i'm on.
great, but missing one thing.. the only thing this app is missing is a way to input hours on my time sheet.
the app have few bugs & the customer support sounds like they not familiar with their products. when you create a new customer and saving it and then you need to change some information in the contact it still shows the previous info contacted customer support few times and they are useless
great for invoicing out but that’s it. was hoping this was the answer to our accounting. it’s quick and easy to send invoices and take pics of your receipts but when it comes to inputting invoices you receive from your suppliers it’s a huge let down!! waste of time
makes accounting a breeze. this app is great. link it to your account and it quickly learns how to categorize your expenses. then all you have to do is confirm or adjust as needed. 👍👍
lacking bank register. i don't really touch the other features, i'm solely interested in coding bank transactions when i have a few minutes spare. cannot be done via this app.
. very easy to use great app
convenience. i really love the convenience and accessibility of this app and quickbooks online. since switching from desktop pro to this i've been able to keep up with paperwork in the field. i think it's great. i just wish they made an upgrade so i could automatically subtract expenses from specific jobs. having everything separate is a real hassle.
. very useful
superb!!!. this is a great app for keeping up to date with accounts. links to my bank accounts and intelligently matches transactions and remembers previous matches and entries. certainly deserves the name quickbooks based on how quickly i can enter my bank transactions. great for multiuser access and very easy to set up. overall this is much better than i expected.
easy to use. overall i like this. having a quick option while on the go is great.
predatory data collection. the app wouldn’t allow me to accept payment without my giving it geo location. why do you need it, other than to use it in ways completely unrelated to my bookkeeping? the app was already near useless. good bye qb app!
. every time i send a invoice with pdf attached it says email sent pdf not
qb makes me look good. qb app is fantastic. i can write and present an estimate right at the job site or give my customer an invoice, or accept payment. in brief....it makes me look good!
streamlined management. this is a very intuitive software for finances.
. quickbooks does not work. it's a terrible program with a zero customer support. the problems i have are very basic and i'm certain others experience the same problems yet they are never resolved. i can't attach screenshots and i don't have the patience to enter all the problems experienced but i hate quickbooks and it's a shame that have such a grip on the industry because i would dump them with a smile immediately if i could
boost to my business image with my ipad!. i went from handwriting every estimate, sales receipt and invoice to bringing in new paperless technology. at the end of the day i would have to have my wife input everything in our quick books online. then file everything in our office. it's not only impressive to our clients, but it also eliminates filing and an extra step of data entry, it saves time and money and gives you a competitive edge over your competition!
. they make it very confusing to cancel your subscription. i've been playing around eith my account for 30 mins and still can't find where to cancel my account and not get charged by them. i swear i'm not stupid either. also half the pages don't load when i need them.
simple and beatiful. i'm a happy paying customer. the ui can certainly be improved but it is simply the best of it's class at the moment. the ready customization for malaysia gst and online integration with malaysian banks are awesome. i love the modern look of the web and mobile web version while their competitors are still stuck with ui from late 90s and early 2000.
unable to access my account. this app does not work. i am unable to access my account it just goes back to the splash screen.
figuring qb. been using this version ( the only one i ever used) for over 2 years. it seem to get better and continue improving. i still feel frustrated at times about a certain feature but whenever i need support it's available.
love it. ian finally able to track my expenditures and income totally on the go. no more playing catch up! love that i have receipt images and that i can make notes that will refresh my memory on the exact thing i bought. just getting to putting my logo on invoices... i know that there is a lot mor that i can do with this program i am very much a beginner love what it does so far!!!!
. love the qbo app for small businesses. so much that can be done quickly.
accounting. best program for my business. great access and easy to use.
does most things well. title says it.
. this app is very useful for preparing and sending quotes and invoices on the go. so if i'm out of the office for the day, i can get work done.
stuff always wrong or glitchy. seems every time i turn on quickbooks by pc or mobile app, something doesn't work! never buy online version, it sucks
many tech issues  poor customer support. after weeks of connecting to my bank account and importing my transactions automatically, the app decided to stop doing that. customer service was not helpful. also the reporting capabilities and graphics are very limited.
. great app. use it to run my business.
great for small business owners.. awesome app. very convenient and keeps the finances and work orders organized. takes some trial and error but well worth the effort to learn this system. you tube has many instructional videos on how to expedite learning this program. price is reasonable for what you get. don't hesitate to get it. if anything you will learn something.
good value for money. happy with the program and functionality across varied devices
finally. i can’t believe it has taken me this long to become this organized with in my business. being able to scan my receipt and toss it in the trash feels amazing. no more consuls full of old receipts.
valuable tool to have in the field. i installed the app, imported company files from my desktop and boom i was doing estimates and invoices in the field.
. great app
victoria. love this.
quick books online. good for customer data base. good for invoicing and receiving payments. fair at tracking expenses. near useless as an accurate or bookkeeping tool when linked to a bank account. so many obscure and poorly explained manual actions required that error is easy to introduce and tech support usually makes things worse. one may as use good old fashioned paper ledgers and a calculator. don't trust it with your numbers!
3 year user.. lots of glitches. signs me out within seconds of logging in and there’s many steps just to put items into an invoice or receipt.
. simple and to the point.
limited functionality, issues signing on, given up.... i have tried to use the app for sometime but find the functionality limited and not sufficient to be practical. in recent weeks i have had an issue switching clients which support has been unable to resolve. i am deleting the app & will use the web version.
a great improvement over the mac desktop version. it saves me tons of time that i used to spend recording payments, expenses and running reports. client payments are easily paid via credit card by the client and automatically applied to the invoice. it has simplified my accounting.
mr. the problem with quick books on line is that you can't choose what account a payment is credited to when using an ipad or iphone. it automatically placed it in to an undeposited account and then you have to log on to quick books using a pc and transfer it over to the desired account. for example current account. basically you do the work twice and defeats the option of doing accounts on the go.
. great experience. great results. making me run my business. more efficient
simple to use. saves so much time
existing customers badly treated. this company refuse to permit existing customers to switch to (the less expensive) simple start package even when they meet all criteria. go elsewhere instead.
great app!!. i love it! this program has totally transformed our family business!!
great app if it worked.. this app was really promising at first, but now it seems like i consistently have issues with chase bank accounts and american express accounts updating. it’s monday and sine thursday my alchase accounts say they are updated when they are not and my amex continuously has error connections. and then u call customer service and they ask you if you called amex to see why there was a connection problem. a shame.
business owner. qb app is so hard to use and is different on every device. if you lose connection while creating an estimateinvoice etc. you will lose all info imputed and have to reenter everything again
. easy and quick to use for estimates, invoices , receipts and keep track of expenses and income
ios 10.01 update...... awful! not user friendly. keeps telling me to update safari to use program. still can't run checks!
was fantastic. everything worked great until the last update now the air print cannot find printer!
. it sucks if you have credit problems you can't link bank and get payment they don't say that anywhere though do they
me. quite useful for quick insight of status of company's books.
"so frustrating. ""updated"" the app... telling me now that i need a new version of the app and since i already have it, not sure what i'm supposed to do. even my accountant agrees quickbooks online is too confusing. waiting for 2016 to close out my books and use a new program."
great so far!. i am really glad we went with quickbooks online, as i love this app! being able to pull up any and all financial information as well as build and email estimates and invoices on the go is crucial to our business! thank you intuit!
great small business tool. excellent on a laptop, doesn't handle banks with authentication dongles very well, mobile app doesn't handle them at all. can't do payroll from mobile. receipt tracking is easy and works well. reports and snap shots handy.
needs to improve. the more i use this the more i find things that annoy me. when reconciling the bank why can i not just add a receipt photo to a bank transaction. that way i don't have to add it as an expense then match the bank transaction. it would save me time. seriously considering giving xero a try.......
excellent product! saved my life!!!. saves so much time and stress!!!!!!!!!
creating an account is a joke and does not work.. creating an account is a joke and does not work despite entering all information correctly. uninstalled!
. app doesn't open anymore
mileage tracker, not working. i have emailed for help, chatted with online help and nothing is solved. the last response i got from the chat support was “oh.” there is something wrong with the app not my phone. i can’t even save mileage manually, i get an error that says “try back later” i am paying $40month, this needs to work.
". i hate it. you can't do ""billable"" expenses from the app. you cant edit invoices that have been sent. terrible. i hate it."
. good app as a supplement to using online or computer version. would still love a better fast upload for expense receipts on the fly rather than so much data entry or using a 3rd party app.
. the app has been having system errors & technical difficulties since january. why? my credit card is still being charged monthly fees and the product that im being charged for isn't working. your system is broken & flawed. please cancel subscription and refundcredit my card back. i would really appreciate it. i'm not interested in speaking to another rep. refund...
. the app offers very few features.
dont use free bank transfer!. it says you will receive funds in 23 business days but they don’t tell you it will take 23 days until they process it and then another 23 days to process it to your account. would have been worth the 3 hour drive to pick up the check. don’t use the free bank transfer just tell customers to transfer bank to bank instead of using quickbooks accounting bank transfers.
great app. works as intended handy to have quickbooks in your pocket
not for the ipad or iphone. the app does not support stp... have to access using web browser on ipad iphone . so don’t buy the app if you want to use it for stp. browser access using an ipad pro , you won’t be able to scroll down or access command icons because they are beyond the margins of the ipad screen. can’t finish inputting categories because the screens won’t scroll at all
qb online. absolutely perfect i've been using the qb app and this is exactly what i've been looking for i'm a painting contractor and this app is going to make it easy for me. if you are a qb user it's a must get
. user friendly, simple to use.
super & excellent apps. very user friendly application . i would recommend this software to other people
tried them all. i persevered with other systems and intuit quickbooks online has been sensational since i migrated over. excellent adaptability, intergratibility and functional practical to use. very happy! keep up the good updates.
great app!. easy to use, syncs nicely. very user friendly and keeps me informed while on the go!
finally organized. this program has allowed me work on net 15 and 30... without worry of payments. also freed up estimating time. thanks
. this app has changed the way i do business for the better. i can update invoices, check profit reports, and so much more very easily.
. works as expected very happy just through the app you can not attach pdf documents to the invoices at this time which i wish it could .
not able to login. never download this app. i have reported this error many times to the quickbooks support team. till this date they haven't even just looked into this issue.
unable to signin. since the update, qb won't authenticate on iphone 5s: either it states technical difficulties or the login info is incorrect. i'll uninstall and install to see if that resolves this new programming error.
easy invoices. although some setups require a full web browser this app is great for new companies setup and invoicing.
new version stinks. one of the main reasons i use the app is so that i can pull up my customers entire transaction history when i'm out in the field. the previous version did that beautifully. other problems as well.
is ok. would like to see that an invoice has been sent to customer so i don't continue to add as i accumulate for that customer. would also like to see a statement with accumulative total and next invoice showing any outstanding amounts. but not bad app.
good. love that i can get information where ever i am. i wish that it was closer to the computer screen to make navagtion easier but it works
editing invoices on the go!. i love it! when life is such a bustle and you need to create an estimate or invoice for customers, quickbooks makes it easy to do.
majestique. excellent app. does everything it says. company financial is tracked better onthego.
horrible!! worst waste of space ever!. would give negative stars if i could. absolutely horrible app, can't do a damned thing; can't enter or edit or view bills, can't enter new customers, can't enter new or edit existing invoices, can't enter new expenses or edit existing, can't enter or edit payments. can't figure out what this is supposed to do except take up space and cause frustration. do not waste your time downloading. like others said, use excel and a shoebox.
. please return the notes options this last update is very bad
hd lawn care. this app has help me so much with my business billing. i highly recommend it.
love it. easy to use and reliable. customer love the fact that they can sign the estimate and invoice.
. great app
i like this software but not sure. how do i export this information or report or how do i print
really helpful!!. i am a computer engineer and being able to make estimates and invoices in the field has really helped me!
love this app!. i can send invoices anytime, anywhere from any device :)
great app. helps me stay on top of my billing.
can’t find projects on ipad version. yes trying to send an invoice but allocate it to a project and it doesn’t look like it is going to give me the option
amazing. all i can say is i used quick books desktop version older version, the online is amazing and the availability of this app and the notifications keeps me up to date on every aspect of my businesses
. best app ever i used
i love this app. i love been able to do my work on the go, and quick book helps me do that
pretty complete finance from your phone. i'm not too sure about the need for a separate app for payroll, but this does work as advertised for the most part.
. love the software, the app is very functional and easy to use.
. used to work perfect ever since update it's very unreliable. can't log into app reliably. it often locks me out right when i'm standing in a customer's house trying to invoice them or locks me out when i need to go through my client list for a phone number etc. i suggest you consider competitors software until the app becomes stable again.
"""quickbooks + square"". great app!!"
. this app is honestly magnificent. it helps me balance my checkbook. helps me track expenses and send invoices. it's honestly a must.
. better and easier to control. good job and well done to your team. keep up the good work!
app says i don’t have an account. the desktop app and now the ios app don’t work. and accessing quickbooks online from the ios browser is a poor experience. from reading other reviews, this seems to be a known issue that has no resolution to date.
only a trial. would have been nice to know it was a trial only, i saw the in app purchase option but no where did it say trial.
. makes my life easier
. great accounting app. easy to use and robust.
sooooooo easy. each update gets better and better, making bookkeeping easier and easier.
. worked fine until they updated the app, now does not work at all, can't even find my account, worthless
app. using this app is like being your own accountant. it helps keep track of your income and expenses. i highly recommend to all self employed people.
"update broke the app. since the update i have to type my password each time i open it after it has been closed for a while. this doesn't work in front of customers. (yes, i enabled touchid. the problem seem to be hitting others and is based on now intuit decided to ""fix"" touchid by breaking it in this version)"
working great, love dashboard. app is easy to use on the go. some things are better done on desktop but for the most part can do a invoice from phone and accept payments.
life saver!. i absolutely love this app. when i first started out and i didn't have that many funds in the bank, this was one expense i didn't even have to overthink. after using quickbooks online app for only a week i knew i could never go back to organizing my finances on my own. i use it every single day!
excellent. quickbooks online works great for me and makes my work much easier especially with the phone app
terrible support  avoid. terrible, terrible support. continual promises of call backs from customer support agents on live chat never happen because the bugs you find are too hard. open tickets for bugs never get resolved. you ask for a supervisor or manager and you have to email the person you’re complaining about?! get told that because of system bugs you have to manually delete the key back in multiple entries. you’ll be left at year end with books that don’t balance like me. avoid!
quickbooks accountant. client writeup software
. this app is very useful for my shop for trak inventory item and gst purpose and more
needs a lot more work. i downloaded both versions and i am disappointed that ipad has fewer features and functionalities compared to iphone version. it is more convenient to work on a tablet however until all the features are included i am just going to continue online. hopefully qb will send an update soon.
. does the job
how can a customer approve an estimate??. why do you have the electronic signature function available for the ipad and not android?? it defeats the purpose of having a tablet on the job site. i may as well stick with my 3 part form.
love the new app. 5 stars
app crashing. after updating to the new version, app is crashing. kindly resolve the issue. not able to use
excellent for small biz and freelancers. as a freelance artist who travels a lot, this app (plus online access) suit all of my accounting needs. easy to follow after you've learned the basics, and love doing my monthly books while on the subway. has clients and books all in one place. helpful to see who owes money and to track income flows across each year. all the reports are fantastic. best accounting software out there, worth the investment imo.
great app. it's good to use this to add pics of receipts to your account while you work on the mac. i have been waiting for this for such a long time. i needed something to replace the outdated ato's erecord.
missing a major key demographic.. although a good application, there are some things missing  like the ability to do business income taxes for t2 (corporations). this feature should be able to send those docs to cra in a format that ready to go. especially when small business corporations are being targeted in the media. help make this easier  there's no reason this feature should not be incorporated into the software.
invoice missing. i sent an invoice from my computer but is not recorded in mobile app. prob wont be buying
. great app. been using it to run my business for the last 3 years and loving it still.
messed it up with update. i don't like that invoices send through intuit, nor that the app no longer integrates with gmail for emailing clients. please get rid of the pretty colors and fix the functionality. this update really makes the app much harder to use.
very useful. great app yo keep up with your income and expenses. i just love the way everything is set up.
signing out.... ugh this app keeps signing me out in the middle of my work.. please fix this soon.
awesome. i have an hvac business and everything in this app is awesome. the invoicing,estimates,collecting payments, emailing invoices or estimates, the whole thing. my wife does the books and she loves this version of quickbooks better than the pro version. i can access it from my ipad or iphone and my wife can access it from her samsung phone. all around great app. you do have to have the quickbooks online version on a computer and it has a monthly fee, but well worth it.
. excelente app
easy to learn. easy to learn good support. i would like to be able to upload invoices sitting in my iphone pdf or ibooks app, or even better, directly from my email attachments, into the qb app when i am entering expenses. currently i only have the option of entering a photo. best wishes, dee
glitchy and they keep raising prices. constantly crashing, both the ios app and the mac version. and they just raised the price to $60month. not worth it.
so convenient. i use this app for work all the time. it is so handy to have it on my phone when i leave the office.
. this app hacked my phone and when i uninstalled it it reinstalled itself and destroyed my phone, do not install this app
good app i’ve grown fond of. makes my life 5 times easier. definitely worth the money
thanks intuit. i can create invoices at the job and get paid on the spot. ..no problems so far.
poor. this app makes very poor use of the screen real estate of phablet style phones and even worse on ipads. they also removed the comma from the keyboard, so adding additional email addresses to a customer is impossible. generally a poor design, this app is years behind where i should be.
. awful. go through the web browser instead. the app doesn't connect frequently, saying the program is offline, but i can connect through the browser with no problems.
. clean and intuitive great app for in the field estimates, this is probably my favorite feature. payment entries for cash payments is handy onsite as well.
. software works ok and only ok. however the monthly price seems to have gone up exponentially for no reason over the last 2 years. edit: changed from 3 stars to 1 star thanks to the developer's response.
missing features. works ok. i think there are a few things that need to be addressed as a whole with quickbooks online, like not being able to print sales receipts if not paid at time of creating invoice, and no way to assess finance charges and late fees. every company needs those two things in my opinion. i can't imagine why they didn't include those features.
quick books online. ease of bookkeeping entries at home or on the go  i thereby circumvent hiring to data entry
great complement to quickbooks online. not the full program, but it makes it easy to keep up to date with expenses on the fly.
. great app! makes running my business so much easier
if it worked.... won't load my bank balance in the app i have to do it on the laptop, it's frozen twice and can't connect to qb online. had it 12 hours so far
can't even log in. first time user, created an account, i even did a password reset. when trying to log in, i get error msg or simply crash out.
no inventory tracking, no reminder. very disappointed with this no inventory tracking, no reminder for the app no not also for me its pointless quickbooks you better fix it i am cancelling my subscription
disappointing. this is a very unstable product with an unreliable app server. if my accountant didn't require it, i would not use it!
really good app. ok, at first i was reluctant to use it, but after trying it i found it really easy and simple. don't wait, use it.
. very user friendly app.
. zero! the app says it needs to update, then brings me to a screen giving a choice of uninstall or open. if i choose open, i'm back to the need to update. if i uninstall and reinstall, that's just more steps before i'm back to the same useless place. garbage software.
quickbooks. really hard to get online started i'll write another review when i get it started
user friendly. works great!. great app for running a small business. easy to use for estimates, invoicing, accounts receivable, etc. can't wait to integrate it with our payroll to make billing for labor even easier. highly recommend.
don't bug me for reviews. the title says it
disappointed. needs touch id for login, and bugs fixed for ios 8.
perfect software for the right companies. i absolutely love it! i have a small freelance design company, so i'm billing for services and commissions. there is nothing i need that it doesn't do and do well. i don't need inventory, estimates or payroll, so this program is about as friendly to me as it could possibly be.
great addition to the business. this app couples great with my at home business. love it!
. inconsistent.. can't access my file through the app today. keeps force closing after authentication. not really good enough intuit!
. so far so happy!
"fees on fees. while the app itself works and is fairly handy, i strongly advise against quickbooks as a company. i signed on as a business owner for $6.95 a month and was immediately slapped with over $100 in fees hidden in ""fine print"". worse is the utter inability to get any customer support from intuit. i canceled my subscription and despite already paying for the month, lost access immediately and lost all of my records. then i got billed again. stay away."
still can’t upload images for receipts. still can’t upload images for receipts
great. good app. does what i need it to do.
lacking. app is seriously lacking in functionality. don’t buy quickbooks online unless you plan to do most of your work from a desktop. kind of defeats the purpose. way overpriced and they keep raising the price too :( wish i had stuck with the quickbooks pro platform.
learning curve and then it's awesome.. takes some getting used to but i've now got it and it's actually very useful and easy to use. integration between my pc and iphone make it easy on the go and sitting at home. estimates, invoices & expenses all in one app.
pdf note on ipad. why can't we add a pdf note on ipad app. i can do it by accessing desktop version on ipad. but it's a pain doing it that way. it would be simpler to add that option to the app. come on guys keep up with the technology. quit lagging behind.
. makes life easier
it's nice but could use some improvement. i use the phone app and the mac app, there's things that annoy me and waste time when using.
unfinished app. you guys shouldn't have launched an app with half the major features missing.
. i have tried the thrial for my buisness and found it projected profits higher than actual and expenses that didn't match up regardless to synching it to accounts like square or my bank. if this is the trial then im not sold. if i had turned this apps inaccurate projections into the irs they'd audit the hell out of me. ill stick to good old fashion analog style accounting thank you.
. great app. obviously nots as many features as browser access but an amazing app nonetheless.
crashing app. latest update crashes constantly on iphone 11 pro. fix it.
the app was a wast of memory on my phone. and the generic responses to past posts make it worse. sorry, your app is giving you a bad rep..
great!!!. i love this app i love qbo what else is there to say. recent update created tons of issues with ios 9.3.3 some glitches evolved not sure who's fault but hope they get fixed. i appear to get error messages entering my expenses :(. can't save invoice created either please fix. otherwise when the app works it's great one star is its current state.
awesome!. fantastic app. as a freelancer i am often away from my office. being able to create estimates and have my clients sign them on the spot has been great. and being able to send invoices from anywhere has absolutely changed my life! love it.
. user friendly
easy and convenient. as a first time user, both app and desk top versions of quick is easy to use. moreover, the app makes my life much easier. even when i'm out of the office, invoicing, paying, receiving, and quick views of current status can be done at the fingertips.
not working with ios13.0. not able to click on customers, create new estimates or invoices. tried reinstalling. still no luck.
. made life easy! amazingly user friendly
. realmente útil y fácil de usar, después del periodo de prueba no me peso pagar su precio.
great tool for those on the go!. while there is a lot of functionality missing that would make this app even more convenient, what it does offer is a tremendous help while on the go. from creating invoices to recording expenses to seeing your p&l and balance sheet, this app is a great tool and extremely easy to use!
down graded. from april this app is unusable. i down graded to qb online. it appears it was released about a year too soon. nothing but frustration from day one. the phone app is all but useless.
rubbish. on quite a few occasions including the last six or seven attempts ‘unable to get all my quickbooks data’ think i’ll be binning this app!
. this app constantly signs itself out. it takes forever to load. quickbooks online has been a mistake from the start but i'm vested. its going to be difficult to change but i'm going to find someone else. the iphone app sucks worse.
helpful app 😊. so far very satisfied with this app. able to record expenses and deposits on the go and quickly. less time spent doing tedious book work. two thumbs up! 👍🏻👍🏻
. overall is a very good app. the only issue that i have right now is that i can't print wallet checks on the online version.
the essential app. who thought being on top of your accounts would be so much fun. benefit from the experience of the pioneers. you will be impressed to see how easy it is to use. trial this and you will thank your self for doing so.
indispensable tool. all business owners should have a mobile app that makes finances easier to manage. this is one of them. thank you intuit!
. extremely difficult to use and doesn't show my invoices if i need to edit something.
quick books app. good to connect and keep up with the business!
. i have tried the thrial for my buisness and found it projected profits higher than actual and expenses that didn't match up regardless to synching it to accounts like square or my bank. if this is the trial then im not sold. if i had turned this apps inaccurate projections into the irs they'd audit the hell out of me. ill stick to good old fashion analog style accounting thank you.
. do not purchase this app!!!!!!!!!! you can never upgrade. to upgrade, you need to cancel account and reenter all data in upgraded version. purchase only direct from quickbooks not the play store!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! if purchasing from quickbooks, you can upgrade as your business grows
. sucks
. having the app makes quickbooks that much easier. now i can write invoices on my phone no matter where i am at. time saver!
. love the app because i have access to my business accounting any where
great fing app!!. i love this app, everything syncs over so well from the web version. it's very simple to use and makes my job a hell of a lot easier!!
. brilliant app
. great app recommend it to anyone with a business
. while this app has a couple of problems, the benefits far outweigh the negatives. i would recommend it to anyone in business
helpful. while not a fully functioning mobile version of qbo, this app is great for checking up on things.
decent.. the program is regularly requiring me to update my accounts and will not auto update and refresh my bank accounts. not as user friendly as i thought it would be.
. super powerful and great on the go. there is a learning curve as with anything this powerful but quickbooks makes it easy to learn and has the best customer service
. love this app.. so easy to use!!!!
not working properly after update. people have businesses to run!! i understand glitches from freecheap apps. not something that costs $360year. why did you replace the pin with passcode? i don’t want to log into my iphone, ever. all i need secured is my qb app and the pin worked just fine for that. with this update i can login successfully once every 2030 attempts. intuit, test your updates before you release them!!!
. the software just keeps crashing when i start it after i input password for last few months . i have only used compyter version. not very friendly software
does not work with ios13. does not work with ios 13
ok for readonly activities. don’t get me wrong, i love the qb online version i use from my pc. you will not find anything better for the price. but the ipad version just doesn’t do tons of things i want it to. it’s ok if you want to run a p&l or bs but i run dozens of different reports that are unavailable for some reason. again, ok for checking balances, just not nearly robust enough to bother with for accountants.
. makes my life super easy. i cans end invoices on the go, receive payments as i open my mail, super easy!
need to be able to access full site. maybe i haven't had enough coffee but most mobile apps allow one to bypass the app and go straight to the web based version. this is frustrating  trying to quickly locate a reconcile issue in the register and can't see the data i need to effectively do so...
outstanding. love it
estimate layout. i like the way the app works, i have problems when i need to include a lot of info on the estimates. when i send it it leaves the first page blank and cuts of some of the info on the second page. overall great though!
quickbooks. works great . happy with the app
great app. very nice and good
effective. we love the fact that our company can work together from distant  separate computers. we really appreciate that quickbooks continues to upgrade and modify their program.the initial ( 4years ago drove our bookkeeper a little crazy) but each update makes sense and increases speed of system.
love the app!. convenient
. hard to use. i bought it because of taking pictures of my receipts and i've yet to get that done. plus the app doesnt work on my phone. have to log in each time. if i had it to do over again i would not waste my money.
simple things just don’t work in this app.. now i can’t copy my password from my password safe into the quickbooks login. this means i will have to use a simple easy to use and less secure password. also, there is no way to enter check numbers into the bank transactions. this works fine on a mac and online but not in the ipad app. these simple problems make the ipad app almost useless.
pretty basic and useless. edit: still can’t see monthly reports. i don’t need the annual pl as much as the monthly. can't do a lot of things. it's very very basic , pretty much a basic overview of your account. you can’t do anything even as detailed as seeing the transactions in a pl report. it’s only broad overview stuff and entering new transactions. can’t even switch cash vs accrual. severely limited and cannot work in a pinch when you can’t use an actual computer.
can't even register. server error when creating company 1000x sgxs5 + sgxts (lollipop)
. am happy that it allows me to.make estimates from my mobile phone
. quick books online asking me to update app through website .... will not open.
the best. buy an ipad. shred up your paper estimatesinvoicing. stop using pens. download this app. holy crap i've been in business 4 years and feel stupid after downloading this. plus u look awesome w an ipad. plus everything's stored forever.
consistent. consistently bad. just like the qb for mac was unreliable and terrible, and purposely left that way to push customers over to qb online, this is no different. buggy, unreliable software is about the only thing intuit excels at.
missing data on iphone and ipad. i have an issues where invoices are missing for some customer on both iphone and ipad. the show up absolutely fine on the web. i can see the payments but get the error when i open the payment qbm.error.00500000.reason.iphone. please fix asap
loads of bugs since updating to ios 13. broken links. can’t call up customer information. dashboard only shows banking information. invoices and estimates haven’t saved when generated on mobile device.
great app!. this app has saved me tons of time and i love it!
. very easy to navigate through
. love this app.... only two things that i can't figure out. first, will not let me have a service date when making an invoice. most important, cannot figure out how to get it to accept the online payments thru ipn. on the desktop version it is highlighted on the invoice and in the email when its sent. other than those two issues, this app is great. would love to use this daily!
. my only complaint is if i'm writing or editing an invoice on the mobile app and want to put a discount i can't put a negative amount.
great for our small business. love a lot about it. easy to use! i don't love that some transactions are hard to recode to another payee. some default and you can change. for the most part i do love it.
so much that's so wrong. this rating is for qbo overall, because the app lives in an infrastructure. qbo is rapidly becoming the biggest pos in the accounting world. not sure what they’re trying to do, but it isn’t producing a usable set of books. the app is just a small part of the collapse.
excellent mobile app. hopefully they will integrate a few more features soon to make it complete.
. great app, though i still need to refer to the desktop version. i am unable to pay employees through the app.
. so far go good. very nice app for tracking my business
last update killed this app. i can't even.... will wait for the next update g to then i can't use it.
. this has to be the worst app going zero customer support constantly lied too been trying for 3 weeks to send an invoice and they don't care as long as you keep paying absolute rip off...not far from being a scam spoke to managers about problems and still nothing done do don't waste your time or money...try any other program or stick to pen and paper far better and less stressful
"didn't want to give in but i did lol. i didn't want to get quickbooks for our small business but finally did. i'm glad i did because now i don't have to go through each invoice ""old school""."
qb online. i switched to qb online because i needed the mobility so i can write invoices from my smartphone while on the go. my old desktop version was so much easier to use and navigate through than the online version. in my opinion the online version is far less professional and versatile. i guess i’m stuck here though as the desktop version doesn’t work while i’m traveling.
. i love qb it does everything but it takes to long to get your money so i've been processing with paypal then copying it over to this fix this issue and 10 stars
finally p&l support. very useful now with this feature. waited a long time.
so easy. thank fou for this easy and convenient app to keep our business streamlined!
absolute garbage. the ios app and their windows and os x apps are trash. constant workflow interruptions to relogin, then reauthenticate via email. i've spent hours typing in password and security codes in the last month for no reason. same ip, same computer... no need to constantly log me out and ask for another security code. the only thing their security seems to do is keep me out of my account.
great app so far. great app. one thing needed i’d making it easier to change customers info when doing a new invoice for a previous customer but at a new address.
. this mobile app now wont update banking. which is no good for a mobile business without running laptops.
very good!. very flexible product. love the mobile application. would like more canned reports and the ability to print weekly time sheets. overall a 9 out of 10.
couldn't perform like we do without. great app!!!! highly recommended. tracks and categories everything with moderate input from you. great on tax day!
i love this quickbooks!!. it makes my life easier and helps me with my taxes. just a few clicks and a email and my tax guy has all he needs
. good. needs ability to save credit card info so easy to invoice in the future.
decent app. very limited features. needs to allow photo capture of customer checks. also needs deposit feature.
very useful. i run a small business with this software. i haven't found anything better yet!
. awesome business app
convenient. best app ever for business
all the essentials in an app. works good so far. allows for quick sorting of transactions and gives all of the essential components for a mobile version. it would be nice to be able to work in budgets in app.
fantastic. we are a small chauffer business, since using quickbooks online we gave cut the acoustic administration down by 60%. and it can be used in the vehicle via the app. and best of all, it works.
great to use on the go!. love this app. i use it alongside the website, this is on my phone. it's not as easy to navigate around as the website but it's not intended to use totally on its own. i love being able to send invoices whilst doing other things  really helps me to consolidate my time.
. great app
. it's ok when it works, but it takes forever to do anything. it's extremely slow. now it's stuck so it crashes everytime i log in so it can't be used at all. edit: reinstalling the app seems to fix the crash bug.
. great program
. you can't edit invoice style, and the web version isn't any better. i constantly have to switch between app, website and desktop. the settings and controls aren't easily accessible.
. was wary, but the convenience is worth a lot until the latest update. now i cant sign on. been a week since they told me there was an issue. still not resolved. spent several hours on hold listing to garbled elevator music that can not be turned down. customer support blows.
awesome!. i was hesitant about switching from desktop top to online, but once i adapted i found it was so convenient for people on the go. very simple and easy and ver accurate between desktopiphoneipad. extremely happy i made the change, highly recommended.
. started using it a week ago... so far so good
quicken easy. easy to use great mobile app which meets my company needs very well.
. crashes on launch after signing in with fingerprint
doesn’t work. app won’t open and website is unresponsive. not very impressed with the program.
welshman. love it. simple for me to send estimates & invoices from the field.
. we just started our business, and have been pleasantly surprised with the ease of use, and the customer service has been even better.
great app. i've been a qb user since the early 90's. the app keeps getting better with greater functionally. i'm confident that all functions will be available on the app in future release. i use this app all day to create estimates and bill customers. it's great.
doesn't support timesheet entry. i have an account through my employer that is only used to enter timesheet information. this works great through the quickbooks online website from my pc, but when i try to log in through the app it tells me that i do not have a quickbooks online subscription.
i use it only because i have to.... i'm still waiting for $10,000 worth of invoices that my customers never received thanks to this god awful app. invoice2go is 10 times better.
. great app
terrible app. this app is not even close to what you expect it does not do what your quick books does. there is no way to change product descriptions without having to rewrite the whole item. it does not link to quick books in trial mode and not sure if i want to pay for this service. bottom line this is not what you would expect i think they are still working the bugs out buy some other app.
"disappointed.... i had high expectations for this app., but it just doesn't deliver. half the features advertised return a message ""feature not supported at this time, please log on from a computer""! so what's the point? why not just not release the app until it works? looking for another option."
. great tools to stay organized, track expense s and bill accurately.
new update horrible. it's always been glitch but since the new update i can't add products to the estimate and customer service is clue less in how to resolve the issue.
simply functional. app makes invoicing easy, and allows you to track any outstanding receivables. should make tax time much easier.
lacking compared to ios version. the layout and functionality compared to the ipad version is horrible and hard to use. plus there is no way for the customer to sign for invoice or estimate on tablet or phone. i am an android fan all the way, but i am going to have to purchase an ipad to get the functionality i need. i am very disappointed.
multiple companies. love the app when it's working properly. doesn't switch between companies well, it'll show customers for my other company under the wrong account and makes it impossible to actually work from. i'm sure if you just have one business account it works fine.
ok app. missing alot of important features
best move ever. glad we use the online version because it is easier when not in office to get to our information
. nothing ever works on the app can't create invoicescant add products it's useless
efficient. this app is great for invoicing on the go. i just wish there was a place for my clients to add gratuity when they pay their bill...
great app. good for a non accounting person like me. i can keep track and give it all to my accountant and it gets done. i love that i can send invoices from my ipad and enter info etc. two thumbs up!
. the app is horrible. doesn't update ky information, ia like a month behind. very frustrating. you are good at billing me every month, that part is up to date🙄.
great app. perfect for all your business on the run needs.
. excellent, but doesn't show activity for the vendorscustomers. a rather significant bug.
. i don't usually write reviews, i always dread using the app. i have a lot of receipt that i need to add to expenses. it's a big effort to find the right transaction and add the receipt. it's painful to juggle between banking transaction and expenses. if usability of the app doesn't improve it's enough for me to pay extra and move to xero.
excellent app.
finally. i am now not as lazy taking care of the books for the business. as soon as a customer pays me i am able to record it and not dread the end of the month or tax season.
limited functionality. app doesn’t permit printing or downloading to a spreadsheet format. makes it impossible to reconcile accounts or print statements for records retention. very expensive with limited functionality.
quickbooks. excellent software. easy to use both at home and on the go with mobile device.
. app freezes and crashes several times a day. the photo receipt scan feature is probably the biggest culprit. even simple things like updating my business contact information yields an error message which is usually followed by a crash. the mac version of qbo isn't any better. similar issues there. very clunky, buggy applications. too much time spent troubleshooting. time for an alternative.
no way to record expenses. the app only let you see the info you have but won't let you record or register any expenses
. pitiful. they bricked my account, broken for over a week. third world software.
no brainer. there is no other program i would use to run my business. mike dipietro  owner county view contracting
bad customer service. worked for a month then disconnected from my bank, so email sent, didn’t get a reply for 2 days!!!! emailed again another 3 days later i get a reply, problem with bank couldn’t be sorted so i downloaded xero, absolute pleasure to use.dont use quickbooks!!!!!!!!
makes it easy. i love the easy to use format and more professional looking invoices and estimates. and the format saves me a lot of time filling out forms. before i was hand writing the estimate, scanning and then emailing from my computer at home. qb does all that from my phone. it works very well for my small business.
. great app
awesome app!!!. so easy to use!
. this app sucks and has for years! maybe if they charged us $1,000 a month then they could get it to work. maybe they just don't care enough to make it work. samsung galaxy s7 will not show entire history for past customers. mildly important!
easy for newbie. started out with the desktop version of qb and migrated to the qbo platform. so much better for me and easy to use now. i can send a quote from my phone and then invoice once the job is complete which for a lazy guy like me keeps me on tasks done billing times quicker. highly recommended
. i love it on my phone . but on my tablet it's slow and says non responsive a lot.
can't bring myself to use it.. it's nowhere near as useful as the desktop app. i'd love to be able to create an invoice on my phone or tablet and upload photos right from the device. can't do it yet.
inutil. me encanta qb pero la app me parece inutil, no puedo ver bancos ni cuentas por cobrar o pagar, y para cambiar de empresa tengo q salir y volver a entrar. mejor usar la pagina web.
do not update to ios 13. if you rely on the app, don’t update to ios 13 until they make it compatible. it crashes on startup after face id.
love it!. so far the app is easy to navigate and i like using it.
can’t upload receipts. it’s incredibly ridiculous that you can’t upload receipts from anywhere but your photos app. what if you get emailed an invoice? nope can’t upload it!
great so far. hoping it keeps things simple for me
can't update credit card. i don't have access to a computer with chrome, they don't support ie 8 anymore so i can't update my credit card. so i download the app to see that my account is suspended due to wrong expiration date on my credit card but you can't update in the app. this blows and is useless
update is terrible. since the update, navigation of the app is clunky at best. you can no longer match transactions, or do anything with your banking accounts except to see the balances. no transactions will work. this update has way to many flaws. be cautious to download.
love it. so easy to use and fantastic customer support for those of us who are not good at this kind of thing, would highly recommend quickbooks for all small businesses, we love that being online we can have it on all our devices and have what ever we need on hand all the time, no more leaving quotes at home! invoicing on the run is great too.
horrible photo receipt capture function. the recent update apparently changed the algorithm for identifying receipt paper boundary in a photo that makes no sense at all. two out of three times it only capture a useless fragment of the whole receipt which the makes entering receipts a horrible and utterly frustrating experience.
please fix me. ios 13 ijust upgrade cannot write items into invoices
great app. great app for small businesses
awful. it worked on my casio commando for a year and was great for mobile invoicing and keeping track of who owed what. then i had to uninstall and reinstall and it to try and correct problem with one customer that was showing different balance on phone then pc. it hasn't worked since. i can't log on. it looks like an updated version that doesn't work with my phone. i've sent multiple error logs. waiting for help.
saves me 250month on payroll.. i can now run my corporation from my tablet, without an accountant. invoice on job site while on the clock instead of for free at home away from kids. also it’s 250 bucks a month cheaper for qb to do my payroll compared to my accountant to do quarterly sales tax reporting and weekly payroll for 1 5 employees...
great for keeping up on the go. love the ease of access to not only my business account, but clients accounts as well. i can log in from anywhere and answer questions for my clients. great tool for a bookkeeping business with clients in qbo!
". expensive, not user friendly, cannot send invoices from mobile app and support not able to solve the problem?????? update: the problem was being ""dealt with"" since 4 weeks before my rating. then a few more weeks later it mysteriously became resolved. now the announced g suite integration... where is it? i'm in the uk?"
great accounting app. i have been using this app on multiple devices, so far the ipad version is the easiest to use.
app not working on iphone. i’ve been trying to install the app on my iphone (6s) with the current version of ios for the past couple of months. the app downloads and installs. when i tap the app to open it, the screen briefly shows the intuit quickbooks logo and then closes. i called support but the told me to go to apple. the ability to use the app to capture receipts etc was a big draw to using quickbooks online. very disappointed.
after update statements wont scroll down. after bug fix for ios13, statements wont scroll down. please fix
ceo of gd2k. this is a really good app it has help our business in so many ways. it help boost our profit margin we have been able to close deals, and make invoices right on the spot. i recommend this for a lot of different business with quickbooks online.
works great. really like the functionality of the app. having it available no matter what device i want to use is a real time saver.
. this app is now horrible, it was great up until latest update and now i am unable to run my business using this app. very frustrating when an app takes steps backwards please help????
"don't download latest version!!. software was great before the latest update. now, no more touchid support, no ability to email invoices. we all remember what apple did with the maps mess, i wonder if intuit will have the testicular fortitude to ""can"" the person who attempted to update the already good software?"
few options for a businesses. quickbooks does it right but there are still many options missing. consignment sales for example. being the consignor or consignee
excellent program. we are extremely happy with this program, it has made our company administrators live so much easier.
. does not work don't waste your time.
the best app for small business owners. i own a small business near austin, tx and i used to have to drive home to write up an estimate, but with quickbooks they have truely made it easy and extremely convenient. i highly recommend this app.
. app stops working constantly. mixes up info on invoice and has even added up invoice totals wrong. update getting worse and nothing is being done to fix. have asked for help and get none. i have invoices that have disappeared off the app!? to quick books stop the b.s. and supoort your app.
some good some bad. have had several issues. mostly the program is easy to learn, use and navigate. the issues i have had are not easily resolved. they take time to fix and information for fix are not easily navigated. i do feel that it is safe to use.
great. great app
. very excited with qb, it become a breeze to navigate, and make my business very organized. love it.
so far so good.. love the app. i think it's great any time i can give an estimate, invoice on the road. thanks.
easy. easy to use, and has all the features i need to run my lawn care business. i recommend it to everyone. my only issue was getting my subscription paid for. i worked it out by calling customer service and they were awesome.
. problems with poor follow up i had problems with this app send support email and they don't follow up
good for invoices. the mobile app doesn’t have all options from the desktop app. and it’s something that makes sense... i mostly use the mobile app to check on invoices status. also the alerts ... it sent notification when an invoice is paid, and some basic information as well.
. this is what happens when a company gets too large. first app worked fine and then suddenly refuses to connect to my bank. customer service is a joke. reps were unable to figure out why error 103 kept appearing. after two hours on the phone i was then told it is a systems issue that needs its own ticket. two days later an email arrives stating that the issue is resolved. guess what, it wasn't!! come up intuit! you can do better than this
mobile glitches... love using quickbooks but i run my business out of town where we are not able to have wifi other than mobile hotspot. using the quickbooks mobile has been convenient but also a p.i.t.a... glitches, closes on its own, logs me out, and sometimes doesn’t save invoicesestimates. has been like this for a while and haven’t had any changes..

update. please fix soon app opens and closes after update.
. like it. very convenient app.
. quickbooks allows me to be able to manage my business while i'm at my computer, or while i'm on the road. the analytics allow me to see the highs and lows of my business and it allows me to see my biggest expenses search that i can mitigate if necessary
rnm media and sound. it’s a great app and system. lovely to use and easy to get around. they must just add online reception and receiving of payments. this will make business much much easier.
couldn't ask for more!. everything you need, intuitive and great access with mobile apps!
keeps me connected to my business. the qbo online app is a great compliment to qbo online when i am on the go and do not have access to my laptop or computer. i love the fact that i am always connected to my business even when i have only my mobile phone.
great app. very functional and easy to understand. works well with desktop version.
qbo saves us time and unnecessary work.. we love using the app at our company. integrating the payments and signing contracts on ipads has helped make a huge difference.
awesome!. great app, easy to use.
. country like bahrain and kuwait currency has three decimal. is there any option to set currency in three decimal? we submitted so many requests regarding this issue but no response
buggy. login with my correct password but it's buggy and won't login. asked me to restart the application many times.
accounts don't always show. sometimes my accounts don't load hence i can't reconcile transactions from the phone.
great app. i use this everyday and love it. very easy to use.
. great app! i use it all the time!
. love this app. i'm not that great with technology, but this is so easy to use!
. expenses do not load
great app. app is never up today's with invoices. the app has become useless to me other than being able to find customers phone numbers and addresses. please fix asap.
statement from app ?. works great for me but i wish you were able to print off a statement from the app.
great app. the app is easier to use than the online version on a laptop. well done.
. this app loads so unbelievably slowly and hangs all the time. it also has different data from the web version in the p&l reports along with not being able to categorize expenses into some chart of accounts however works fine in the web page version.
way too limited. i can’t even use the app to see if a bill was processed. it only allows you to view check or ach transactions and deposits. checks processed through bill pay don resigister as activity.
". mobile app is full of bugs, recent ""update"" has now made it so my account is unable to sync and wont let me log in. not very useful for my mobile business. tried reinstalling the app, still no luck."
. bad tech support app has tons of errors had it for a year and a half and hate it !!
great companion app to the main qbo. i like this app a lot. it really helps run my business and to continually update my main desktop app.
great functionality. exactly what my clients need. i can review all transactions from all my clients on the go, this makes bookkeeping fun for my customers and saves a lot of time and money that's what i love!
i love it.. i used to have to enter in expenses and sales, but now all that stuff shows up automatically with my banks being connected. i love it!
. love this app!
awesome app. i waited to rate this app because i knew eventually everything was going to be available on the mobile app. this makes my job so much easier start to finish.
. horrible. difficulty in getting customer service rep. when asked to speak to a manager she continued to argue. not easy to speak to a rep. i signed in and went thru steps to set up quick books it didn't like my information to deposit money. horrible and don't advise wasting money. sat on hold for a manager for an extremely long time more than 15 minutes.
awesome app, love quickbooks. use it often to add expenses and check bank data. nice feature of receipt photo, works great
. quickbooks does not work. it's a terrible program with a zero customer support. the problems i have are very basic and i'm certain others experience the same problems yet they are never resolved. i can't attach screenshots and i don't have the patience to enter all the problems experienced but i hate quickbooks and it's a shame that have such a grip on the industry because i would dump them with a smile immediately if i could
. invoices do not show units sold the invoices total price only show the amount sold
superb app. i'm an electrician and run my entire business on this app it's makes my life so easy :)
great on the move!. really easy to use, keeps my accounts up to date all the time, so much easier than finding time when i'm back home! clients get invoices instantly and i keep on top of payments and expenses. first class
great app. really happy and love quickbooks
can't sync. can't upload data from my desktop to qb online. i have qb pro 2009. is it not compatible?
sweet baby jesus this is exactly what i need. it has never been so easy to stay so financially organized. as someone who os chronically disorganized this app is a blessing. definitely worth the price when you need to record your expenses and write receipts, invoices and all sorts of other business related things to be professional.
so far so good.. love the app. i think it's great any time i can give an estimate, invoice on the road. thanks.
super awesome tool. best app you can get so you have total control over your accounts
great app. easy to use for on the go business. wish it had check printing feature. please add that.
organized. been in business for 20 years and been using this app for a year. love it. still lots beyond my abilities and i wish there was a little more help in the app for the accounting inept like me but i just bring the app to my accountant and they can pull all the data needed. recommend it. see sales, cost, accounts receivable at any given moment.
terrible experience with customer support. we had terrible experience with customer support. for a very important issue we contact qb customer support team, we wait for 6 days an never respond our request. for this incident we can't bill our invoices. we hate our experience. consider customer support if your company needs help.
major flaw  can’t add receipts to expenses. no dropbox or photo option. they advertise this system as super easy and convenient. you can’t add receipts from photos or dropbox. that makes the ‘add attachment ‘ pretty much pointless. i take a picture of an expense receipt but 0 way of adding it ... seriously. who designed this app.???
. app does not sync automatically.
professional.. this app helps me quickly and easily stay looking professional and on time with my invoices and government payments
so far i have enjoyed the freedom from sitting at my computer. i can make estimates send invoices and do my banking right on my phone anytime anyplace.. sweet app
bad program. won't send estimates and invoices. buisness cash flow has been screwed up.
. great app & software on the go.
could use improving. i love that i can quickly post payment and send invoices, but there needs to be a way to see everything and use all of the features. a contractors version would rate more stars from me.
". refreshing bank transactions doesn't work. after refresh and upade still say "" ! error 22 days ago"". causes double entry after entering expenses manually by no refreshing and posting them. doesn't refresh bank data."
. not fully fledged it's great but doesn't do much nor the basic things i would want in an app.. basic reporting, easy input of invoice (picture maybe ocr), accepting account transactions.
great improvement!. makes entering expenses & invoicing so much easier.
. do not use the cc service. they will hold your money for a week and charge you a service charge a week before you receive your money. horrible service.
need improvement asap. need to approve the app asap due to many loss of customers. disappointed of the high price.
keeps locking up. the app keeps telling me i need to update to the latest version, but i already have it. it won't let me log on. frustrating. please fix or revert back to previous version until glitches are fixed.
. best app ive ever purchased
great for simple tasks. love the quick view and invoicing. easy to attach receipts. wish i could do bank rec
junk  plagued with issues. this is is great when it works, but is plagued with bugs. as of recently it logs me out to “refresh,” then when i log back it it tells me the account doesn’t exist. i fix this i have to delete the app and reinstall it, every, single, time. and their customer service is terrible. they never have any solutions.
. great app
disaster. was forced to use qb online due to always changing fees for desktop version. always crashes. hard to use. terrible. wish i could use another program. new version has new colours!! yay so practical!! doesn’t accommodate qc payroll deductions like cssnt but that’s ok, it’s colourful. intuit idiots.
hands down makes your business easier!. i've used qb for years. and and i've come and go thinking i'll find something easier. today's version of qb particularly with the mobile app hands down makes it so easy for me to track everything i do in my business. worth every penny you spend ... and oh ya ... it's a write off!
. love that i can create invoices and estimates on the go. although i would like to manage payroll wirelessly.
excellent. great software
. good only good for invoicing. no way of viewing financial reports via this app.
best app for small businesses. i own and operate a small it consulting company and this is the best business management app in the world. i can literally walk into an office or home of a new customer, add their information and invoice them on the spot. no need to mail an invoice and wait days or weeks. not to mention its very inexpensive.
brilliant on note 4.. just updating my review... still awesome. ;) widget is particularly time saving. widget image needs to be higher resolution so it's a little clearer on my big screen though.
. truly powerful software! takes a bit of getting used to, but once you grasp how it works, which is relatively simple, you're able to meaningfully track the financial health of your business.
new horizons glass wa. works great. do all my bidding and estimates with this app.
efficient. makes my life a lot easier i can create invoices. customers can pay their bill right in front of me what i sent them to the email. can’t get no better than that
quickbooks app. as a finally self employed electrician after many many years in the trade i decided to try qb online & it is quite simply amazing, easy, intuitive, versatile & very good value, looks professional and cannot recommend higher. thank you, matt m.b.s. electrical, jersey
. been using this app for almost a full year was working great, now get error and will not sync data. if it does not get fixed will be forced to move to different accounting solution update; tried your solutions and emailed the error to support multiple times no response. i created another trial account and that one retrieved data no issue. it just wont retrieve data on mobile from my actual company account.
pretty useless. very slow and painful to use, doesn’t let you bank any payments etc. probably only useful for those who wish to produce very basic invoices
coffee machine doctor. this is the safest and fastest accounting system ever just like a shot of espresso
just about there.. for a small business the app makes on the go entries easy. saves me a lot of time when i'm next at the pc. i have issues with some functionality of the software that missed the port from desktop to cloud.
. very easy to use mobile accounting app
. i love that i can do everything for my business through this app!
missing a major key demographic.. although a good application, there are some things missing  like the ability to do business income taxes for t2 (corporations). this feature should be able to send those docs to cra in a format that ready to go. especially when small business corporations are being targeted in the media. help make this easier  there's no reason this feature should not be incorporated into the software.
. great app
not working properly after update #2. people have businesses to run!! i understand glitches from freecheap apps. not something that costs $360year. my books don't match from my phone to my computer. the pin still doesn't work, every time i edited an invoice it magically created a copy of an invoice that showed up 2 days later. now i have a ton of clean up to do in my books. it's time for me to find new accounting software.
love this app. efficient
. i am totally dissatisfied with qb small business app and quickbooks in general. i'm also using an android and having the same syncing problem. i will be cancelling my subscription with quickbooks altogether and will be going with one of their competitors. it has been a waste of my time with all the phone calls with their technical support in the philippines who gave totally incorrect information about the issue which was clarified when i spoke to customer service in sydney.
. very nice shop, darin is very helpful
no support for timesheets. also no custom reports
easy to use and keeps me updated. works great on my s4.
. quick books is a wonderful and helpful program. when i have questions i am assisted by technical support team.
. this app doesn't allow me to add expenses. please fix it. thank you.
excellent app. keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
. very handy makes office life so much easier when having to do things on the run
easy to use. excellent app. very straight forward to use. the only issue i have is not been able to raise purchase orders on the app. this is very important to me because of the nature of my business, other than that it's spot on.
still useless for me. all i want to do is add my time activity and delayed charges for my clients via my iphone. that's my necessary daily task. i don't need to look at my balance sheet every day, change my company information, or customize my default email message with my iphone.
works smoothly. can't tell you how much time i've saved tagging receipts in this app. simple and useful.
business owner. this app has all the features i need to run a small but quickly growing business. easy to navigate.
. the best part for me is the ability to create and email an invoice then recieve payment all from my smartphone.
pointless. the subset of features accessible from this app is so tiny even trivial tasks are impossible. if i have to have a browser open anyway, there's no need for this app. save your time and patienceskip this app and use qbo in a browser.
. on the iphone app you can swipe left or right on expenses, depending on wether it is business or personal, is there a way to do this on the android app? thanks!
i spoke, they listnened. i have had my fair share of frustrations with intuit and when they send out questionnaires i answer them and my biggest complaint was no access to a p&l which is now apart of the app. it's perfect for what i use it for and there's nothing like creating invoices and getting paid on the go. great update and thanks for listening.
found a problem. when creating an invoice adding parts even if you search when you go back to it to add another part it’s still in that same form from before and if you cancel nothing happens you would have to search for whatever else you want by name, you can’t just scroll please fix
don’t update to ios 13 if you want this to work. there a so many bugs with this app now that ios version 13 has been released. you can’t even enter an expense now without an error popping up that you need to create a template. quickbooks online support has been no help. they advised i use the browser on my phone. what’s the point of the app then? test test test folks.
. can't acess since last update!!!!!
great app. great mobile app. only gripe is i wish they would integrate bill pay. other than that, solid app.
download app just to be taken to the browser.. not the self employed version.
. super easy to use...love that we can use it on multiple divices. awesome program
. no good for basic simple book keeping and way to complicated. why would you trust a group of app developers will your banking details
loved it. does exactly what you want. needs more access to desktop features but generally great app
stops unexpectedly. i can never really depend on this app because it shuts down unexpectedly. i can't really get anything done on the mobile app.
connecting my business. as a carpender who has been in business for almost 20 years switching over to quickbooks this year has allowed a much more efficient process. the phone app has changed the speed at which i can respond to customers.
. on the go always..this app helps me stay on the go!!
happy. so far so good, but needed my accountant to help me make head n tails of it. i'm a worrier and was concerned about the financial side of my business. now i'm happy. taken the stress away.
best accounting app except for some glitch. it is the best accounting app that i had so far. i like the inventory part. what i don't like is that the activities for the suppliers are empty but with the web and desktop app the activities appear.
very handy. excellent app love it save me hours in office
great. best tool for small biz ! make my life easier and my customers happy...10stars..
app shows incorrect transactions. transactions do not match the selected vendor. works when you have few transactions. once you pass 20k it becomes slow and inaccurate.
. kinda tricky at first but easily learned
pretty good. the app allows you to record expenses on the go as they happen. nice to be able to balance the books as you go along instead of waiting until you are back at your computer. :)
. where a brand new bakery, and this has been great! we can quickly do invoices and get paid. our bookkeeper especially loves this!
needs work!. not very user friendly... makes me download my companies data every time i login and takes forever and sometimes crashes while downloading it so have to restart the download again. qbo is great but they really need to work on the app cause i could really use it when on the road. but incapable due to its functionality at the moment.
not useful yet. it is okay to check open balances and receive payments, but other than that, there is little functionality. qboa continues to improve, so i expect this app will improve as well.
nice. nice software
. app great for small businesses.
. tried to use it to review transactions, banking section is permanently glitched and won't load transactions or activity.
worthless!. until this app can sync with the desktop version of quickbooks, it is worthless to my business. i'm sorry i downloaded it. but i have already deleted it.
. sucks keeps saying i have update available but then everytime i try to download the upgrade i get error code 927 saying unable to complete download. with current app it doesn't allow me to look up past invoices. the things i use most are not on mobile app. all i do with it is print current invoices with my wireless eprinter and find customer contact numbers to call them. needs upgrading with more features.
crashes non stop on ipad. crashes non stop on ipad
. great app for my small buisness. quickbooks is always improving. best customer service when you have questions.
. great app making it easier to track all of my business finances. and the fact that i can connect it to my other business apps saves me so much time.
. as stated on my previous review,, i have tried every method including the ones quickbooks suggest and i still cannot find an unsubscribe button anywhere, this is very frustrating and ironic in the fact this app is ment to save you time, i spent half a day trying to unsubscribe to this with still no joy , last result to phone the number which does not work over a weekend.
. disappointed!!!! what i need is the ability to download and accept new banking transactions, while on the go. having that ability would allow me to spend only a few minutes everyday updating my books, versus having to sit down at a computer to do this. please add this functionality to the android version of qbo. i can do it on the mint app, but not qbo for android : (
needs some improvements. great app only thing that would make it better is an offline version for the ipad
capturing expenses? approving transactions?. really nothing no support for the consultant on the go? why can't i shoot a picture of a receipt put a dollar value a catagory and a note and have it either for review or added to my expenses. what about my transaction list i can't see the same information from the full website here at all. throw us a bone man....
incomparable with ipad pro. this app works terrible with ipad pro. basically made this business expense a complete waste as the app and web program useless on the ipad pro. extremely disappointed and frustrated.
terrible app...... terrible app it does not work. since last update👿
it's a great app.. good to create invoices on the run, and keep track of your business. my only complaint is that there is no place to put in a po or job name. i would also like if customers could sign with a stylist or finger on a touch screen phone. i have a samsung note 3 and would like to see that option. but still a good app.
organized. been in business for 20 years and been using this app for a year. love it. still lots beyond my abilities and i wish there was a little more help in the app for the accounting inept like me but i just bring the app to my accountant and they can pull all the data needed. recommend it. see sales, cost, accounts receivable at any given moment.
need to support multi account. i have 2 accounts abs it’s a pain in but to switch.
. easy to use, great for keeping track of expenses, account payable, billing invoices, service. link to your bank account to keep track of everything all in one place
love it!. i am a locksmith, need an easy and efficient easy to manage invoicing, books, transactions... qbo has saved me hours every night logging and sending invoices, billing, and balancing my books through my bank. i send invoices on the fly now, and all of the related bookwork is completed simultaneously... seriously wonder how i found the time to complete everything this does for me from my phone or tablet in my car. a real time saver!
. the reviews here are enough to completely switch me off. there's no way i could possibly give you guys money for a service that is clearly dysfunctional. the internet is littered, utterly littered with scathing and brutal truth from frustrated customers it's almost hard to believe. the sheer weight of numbers are irrefutable though. you guys clearly just don't care. wow.
multiple crashes. multiple crashes when trying to add expenses on the iphone.
. after eading all the problems and seeing 90% of the reviews being 1 star im going to save a headache on this scam app should be taken off the market or sued for false advertising and costing people thousands of dollars. all the responses from support sound like they are prewritten for the complaints. please take app off the market and quit ruing the admin side of peoples hard work to start a business.
amazing app. wouldn’t be able to run my business without quickbooks. thank you for the prompt ios 13 update!
room for improvement. it’s a good app, with some good features, perfect for using on your phone. it would be nice, however, if the ipad version was more like the web version with more of the features available there. it’s frustrating having to switch between the two versions.
never worked. downloaded app but it has consistently failed to open. only the message 'unfortunately quickbooks online has stopped'. tried all the suggested work rounds, uninstall, clear data, clear cache. called help centre and their agent couldn't have been any more disinterested. appalling customer service. not worth subscribing. dreadful service.
crashes on open. useful app until this update. it crashes on open, both on ipad and iphone. cannot do business this way...
used to work. this last update has my app crashing and signing me out almost every time i use it. usually this is fixed quickly but it’s been a while now. please update the app so it’s doesn’t crash on the iphone x
hot garbage. latest update to this piece of garbage app requires you to log in every single time. pathetic these guys can’t get it right. update 020219; still has constant logout problems after all these years. would give 0 stars if i could.
. great app
. crashes on loading. android 7
. it's easy to use, and connects with my regular program back and my office seamlessly! one of the best apps i've ever used for my business, keeps me moving smoothly along!
. great app
. after new update the app is crashing
great program!. the pc version is wonderful the mobile app is steadily on its way
. the quickbooks app has been a life saver! very easy to use and helps when i need to do estimates or invoices on the go.
brian peterson remodel. great app. wish i could attach pictures to estimates and invoices using my mobile app.
can't create po's through app. i use quickbooks for 2 things mainly. to create estimatesinvoices and send pos once the invoice has been paid. i can't create po's with the app so it's useless. i have to go to the website every time i want to create a po. it makes no sense that they would leave this feature out.
. user friendly app that makes me very efficient in my field .
"yay...it's working again!!. qbs has been quite efficient and easy to use! i appreciate like the constant improvements!! however, note to developer...i wish this app gave ""real time"" remindsnotices of when to bill a client based on days, just to make it more customized???!? maybe add a calendar with an to synchronize with the personalipad calendars??? i down know, i just find myself calculating day for my customized client each time, instead of just getting a notification. thank, still love this app!!!"
continuous improvements appreciated. keep the updates and enhancements coming!
great app, very useful and always improving!. this app is the greatest tool in our businesses ability to streamline work, easy to use.
stopped recognizing transactions. after the last update it stopped recognizing transactions. even after the manual editing, still does not add them to my income. the same with the desktop app. the only difference is that the manual editing works on desktop.
very happy with qbo. first of all i'm saving a lot of time versus i tried so many apps. i even had qbo one time and canceled hoping i can win. not really quickbooks online is the only way to go. very straight forward.
latest update crashing on iphone 7. app crashes 2sec after being turned on on iphone7. restarted phone, no luck
excellent piece of kit. i've held back from making a review as the requests for a review before really using an app seems pointless. i have now used quickbooks for around five months and to be honest i now could not imagine working without it. it is easy to use, clear and without doubt a high quality product. first class and highly recommended.
great app. i run my one person business on quikbooks and i am not a detail person. my clients comment all the time on the ease of payment!! love it love it
. dreadful experience so far. bought qb 16th dec 2019 and cant get a call back from an english speaker to help me with set up despite multiple attempts! why is sales uk based but support isnt? this is 2nd review  1st disappeared!!! so disappointed and very desperate to get started.
best accounting software. best investment made so far on quickbooks and the app just excels... this is really awesome :) big ups intuit
need ability to accept and categorize bank transactions. an app is supposed to make our lives better. all the bells and whistles in the world to date on qb app don't help if i can't sync my bank and credit card transactions while on the go. can't this be prioritized? surely i'm not the only user who needs to clear my banking transactions and relies on that for expense side.
. best accounting on the good app
tonya pitchford. app and product are useless for my particular business. very hard to deal with, fees are high
solid gold. the transition to the new version was almost unbearably rough, but i am so happy with this platform for my staff + i. still the gold standard, looking forward to more compatible apps...
love it. this app works great for me.. .
good program. wish i could see if my estimates were “viewed”, like my invoices.
great for my small business. integrates well with my online booking app and square reader. helps me to stay organized, spend less time doing administrative duties and more time to focus on what i love to do.
no more bank sync?. used to be able to sync to bank in qbo. please bring it back! 37 did refresh but still no bank tab like in qbo with balance?
good for review but limited functionality. this is a subset of qb online functions good for quick checking on the business but not a working system much like the ipad version of word or powerpoint you get to do a bit but need the full version for the program to be useful
very useful, ios 13 login issue however. as the title says. this software, when combined with the website version, can be incredible useful. the layout is good. i use it for work and once you get to know it it’s pretty good. currently there is an issue logging in with ios 13.
great to use on the go!. love this app. i use it alongside the website, this is on my phone. it's not as easy to navigate around as the website but it's not intended to use totally on its own. i love being able to send invoices whilst doing other things  really helps me to consolidate my time.
business owner mechanical contractor. qbo, has been the best program for my business. i am really impressed with its capabilities, and have been a user for several years now. i am currently trying to integrate every day work apps with qbo for a single point of origin business management software.
. switch to xero even though its more expensive. better off wasting money on a useless app. cant even save a transaction. lousy support and engineering team to not resolve such a essential feauture after 1 month. subscribe at your own risk.
stay well away!. worst software i have used to date. zero customer service. ignores all complaints. takes forever to load. constant problems. not user friendly.
great app. makes life easy. one addition will make it perfect. add journal entry to the app.
glitchy, incomplete features, and poor data. this app needs serious attention. after years of putting up with this hot mess i’m fed up and rarely use it any more. no matter what i do i can’t get data to load that is any more recent than 2016 for most vendors. no one from tech support replies  ever. american express transactions can’t be synched or approved in the app. about the only thing it’s useful for is matching typical transactions in our checking account.
makes life easy. great app that makes accounting on the fly so simple.
small business owner. absolutely awful. i was forced to switch to online because of a fatal error of the desktop version on mac seirra. there are so many bugs and things that aren't available on online that were on the desktop. i literally call support for 2hrs a day.
handy app for small businesses. *****
h2a solutions. best way to invoice my customers
disappointing. i've been a longtime user of the desktop version of quickbooks for the past 20 years and just recently switched to quickbooks online. i was really looking forward to managing my company's expenses, print checks, and enter bills from my new ipad. i am terribly disappointed in the complete lack of features available in this app. it's actually completely useless and a waste of memory. how could intuit release such a piece of garbage such as this?
new app is great!. the new app is super user friendly and versatile. it’s easier to use quickbooks from my phone than it is from my pc now. vast improvement over the previous versions.
app login. i can not login to app using my online login details. have reset again and again and nothing works. very frustrating
expensive. great program, easy to use and has lots of feature. at $20 month is pretty expensive for small small businesses.
landscaping on the run. always busy. not a lot of time set aside for paperwork. i'm loving the convenience of this app
horrible support and wrong selling from sales team. very poor sales knowledge of the product and service is horrible.. following up since morning and they buy 2030 mins and been more than 7 hours concerned person with resolutions didn’t happen
. this app sucks! i can't even login
meh, no project profitability reports in the app. as a construction business all our accounting revolves around p&l reports per project. the onlinedesktop app gives us the project report but the app does not, which makes the app pretty much useless. our best solution is to login to our qbo account through safari on the phone to see the real time project profitability, shouldn’t the app do that?
easily the worst app on ios. this is the single worst and buggiest app on the app store. it is buggy, gives random permissions errors, and generally fails to get the job done.
. so far i've loved everything about this app.
. handy but a little slow
easy for small business. especially for a business in another location
is not accurate. my accounts are not in sync with my bank and credit card ontime balance. needs update.
timed out....... worked for 2 hours on typing big estimate, session timed out, lost everything, how is this able to happen? we send people to the moon in 1969 yet we can’t safeguardprevent this app from wasting hard work and precious time. it’s the first time i thought i could throw my ipad into the next county. fix this stupidity
"not working. i just downloaded it and it said it was free. it sent me a verification code. when i went back to the app now it is saying i have no subscription. i wish it could have said that in the begging because now my business email is ""registered"" and i can't find a way to delete my email address from this program."
awesome app. this is a brilliant app. i have all my invoices and expenses at my fingertips. very easy to use and synchs perfectly with qbo on my mac. keeps me on track with daily reminders of overdue invoices. no one gets away with not paying me now.
horrible!! worst waste of space ever!. would give negative stars if i could. absolutely horrible app, can't do a damned thing; can't enter or edit or view bills, can't enter new customers, can't enter new or edit existing invoices, can't enter new expenses or edit existing, can't enter or edit payments. can't figure out what this is supposed to do except take up space and cause frustration. do not waste your time downloading. like others said, use excel and a shoebox.
slowly losing my business. i'm about tired of this app not functioning properly. embarrassing to say the least when i have a customer trying to pay their bill and i can't even connect to quickbooks online server. none of your apps are working as advertised. $25month for what again? vendor profile on iphone isn't in sync with current information online. trying to enterview bills within a certain vendor and it's showing info from 2016.
it's a pos. i wouldn't have given it a star at all. you can't tell if they person paid you or if you just accidently out it in as a payment. it's hard to use,hard to understand and honestly i lost 134 dollars in sales because i couldn't figure how to use this thing. i'll be using the square starting tomorrow
great for start ups. i am wanting to know if it has been considered for users to use their finger print as an option other than the password to sign in on the app?
easy. extremely easy to use
. very poorly designed app. with alot of limitations for a mobile device. i would strongly recommend finding another service.
. great app would be nice if you could add a logo.
. very user friendly. qbo makes my task simple and easy.
falta información. deberían dar acceso a inventario. aún que sea sin los reportes, para dar una mejor experiencia al usuario y enamorarlo más de app
. the app format doesn't reflect the desktop format menu  confusing for the user. also, the sales  invoice page is different to desktop, with not the same information when shown side by side. the app needs a bitbof work.
. great program to use. super simple to learn. has everything you need to run a small business.
co owner. we opened a small furniture and decor store. we use quickbooks online with few problems, however the go payments part was terrible. on our opening day it couldn't process 5 credit card transactions and has been sporadic ever since. we bought a new i pad hoping the faster processor would help wrong.
. these days, i'm having trouble attaching my pdf scans of receipts to my expenses. i keep getting the error message that says that it can't be processed right now and i have to contact 1800... for assistance. please do something about it! it's getting really frustrating.
. it's an ok app, tends to crash here and there.
. the app is a wonderful accompaniment to the software which makes tracking expenses and invoices really easy
a great improvement over the mac desktop version. it saves me tons of time that i used to spend recording payments, expenses and running reports. client payments are easily paid via credit card by the client and automatically applied to the invoice. it has simplified my accounting.
quickbooks renew account??. renewed my subscription for a year and i'm still locked out, every time i log in it keeps telling me to subscribe for 1 month i tried to go that way and it asked if i wanted to change my current year subscription? makes no sense.. wish some (tech support or program owner) fixes it i'm about to cancel it all..... wy small business owner
game changer. totally transformed my business. really great software, so informative and nice community to support you. no brainer. can't believe i'm raving about accountancy software!
its coming along well. this program is coming along well and expecting some big things
feed. need to be able to change from sales receipt to invoice without canceling and starting over. would also be nice if every few months we didn’t have to delete and reinstall
great for on the go. it helps me send my customers invoices while i'm in the field
biz essential. still learning to capitalize on having my business so accessible on the fly. i send estimates and invoices before i leave the bid sometimes.
. not sure if this was resolved but in reviewing past expenses and invoices, it looks like 85% have disappeared. if i entered more than 1 expense on a single day, it kept 1. some days i entered 56 receipts if not more and now i'm redoing them all. switched to a bookkeeper this year so haven't used the app in 6+ months.
. great app... i like that i can do everything i need to do, and it updates on my other devices too. i would like the option to print invoices from the app that would be a great update.
. restart the app error. uninstalled and reinstalled app. same error.
useless. won't accept my phone number so can't go any further ill look elsewhere for a app that works
fantastic app for small business. i have been using quickbooks for a year now. before i used to use myob and it used to cost me double what i pay now. it has all the features i need and usually works without any problems. i can write up quotes onsite, and send invoices before i leave the job. i highly recommend this app for small businesses.
. great app to manage all paper work and finance.
great app. qb app is great and it's only improving. i can't wait to see how this app will operate in a year.
. great app
cannot input supplier invoices you have to upgrade. bought quickbooks for our subsidiary business, input invoices, pay suppliers etc to find out you can’t actually input supplier invoices unless you upgrade! so from £11.99 a month to £18.99 a month just to input purchase, very odd
. i would rate the app 5 stars if you could trust that the info was accurate. i have, so many times, quoted customers their balance on my route only to discover that it is missing invoices. it appears that this app is virtually worthless as recent invoices are never uploaded to app.
the best!. i can't live without my quick books app! better than paying hundreds of dollars for an accountant
crash with ios13. app does not launch.
awesome app. i'm in sales and this app is so much easier to use than my computer. it takes me 2 minutes to fill in the info and i'm done and my costumers can be on there way. thanks quick book.
junk. this app is an embarrassment to use. doesn't attach correct to emails, rude default email tags, and prints too light to fax. i used qb contractor for 10 years before being talked into ipad by apple as the way to go mobile. save your money do things right. this freezes up a lot too which if you have time to wait may be for you.
i am truly loving this app. been hunting for a simple app for managing the finances of my farm business. this helps me with capturing and analysis of all my expenses and income. the reporting is also amazing. i also love the fact that i can even get more stats and reports via the web. amazing stuff. already introduced it to quite a number of industry colleagues. truly an amazing app
. i use it to attach photos to my transactions.
horrible. worst company and app to deal with. had to click 1 star they are negative 5 stars
loved it indeed. this app works the way i think, i'm considering useing it in my next business. thanks
. it makes life so much easier and its eady to learn and gain knowledge and experience
owner. we own a hvac business. this software is awesome.
extremely slow. painfully slow on both my mobile device and macbook. also, i have to refresh the app over and over to see the latest data. that wasn’t the case before. when i opened the app, it used to show the new data.
so easy to use!. i hate accounting, so this app makes my life so easy!
app doesn’t get updated with the website!. this is most ridiculous app! it doesn’t get updated with the website! they charge you $40.00 per month with no resolution in the near future.
glitchy, incomplete features, and poor data. this app needs serious attention. after years of putting up with this hot mess i’m fed up and rarely use it any more. no matter what i do i can’t get data to load that is any more recent than 2016 for most vendors. no one from tech support replies  ever. american express transactions can’t be synched or approved in the app. about the only thing it’s useful for is matching typical transactions in our checking account.
handyman. love it
easy to use. with no little accounting knowledge you can operate this online tool.
. really nice accounting app. loads of integrations via desktop browser. even a desk top app that i suspect is node based. the best feature which is lacking in other accounting apps is transaction memos. that £200 i lent my mate in july is useful info when you look back a year later.
great. great app easy to use and all but needs a mileage tracker logbook like the quickbooks self employed has
everything i need. qb is perfect for my small business needs. i tried myob and this is so much easier to use. easy to navigate or just get a snapshot
saves me 250month on payroll.. i can now run my corporation from my tablet, without an accountant. invoice on job site while on the clock instead of for free at home away from kids. also it’s 250 bucks a month cheaper for qb to do my payroll compared to my accountant to do quarterly sales tax reporting and weekly payroll for 1 5 employees...
. great app for tracking expenses and payments
great app  easy to use. enough said. it helps me keep track of my invoicing as well as my expenses. great for small businesses.
nice. good app for business
unreliable. this app is buggy and slow. logging in is very hit or miss. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't for no apparent reason. i have not been able to log in for a week. all i get is an error message telling me to try again later. called support and i was told that they are working on it. this app has been out for years, and there is no excuse for it being so unpredictable.
easy to use. i love my quickbooks app. this is the first year my taxes will be done on time because i didn't have to spend hours at desk!
problem with update please fix. iphone x, after updating the app, it doesn’t let me edit any transactions at all, i can only approve what is recognized transaction, an unrecognized transaction is not responsive to touchscreen commands so i have to cancel edit. please fix
login. wont let me log in on app or internet
app says i don’t have an account. the desktop app and now the ios app don’t work. and accessing quickbooks online from the ios browser is a poor experience. from reading other reviews, this seems to be a known issue that has no resolution to date.
cis deductions on apps!. unable to do a cis invoice on the app.. massive let down as this is not a feature yet
quickbooks online rocks!. setting up qbonline to invoice, purchase, and banking downloads makes it possible to be completely mobile with your business! to reconcile accounts you'll need to access the full power of qbonline on a browser, preferably on your laptop or desktop.
very good app. app is ok,but expense entry is still missing on mobile app. from the last update am not able to create invoice or add any items in this app.
excellent. i been using quickbooks in various versions since 1996. i upgraded to online in 2015. as i am a working at customers premises, sometimes 15 different a day, the instant invoicing using my iphone saves me having to sit at my office at the end of the day invoicing. another great thing about online is to check any outstanding invoices from customers who request unscheduled visits.
. keeping on top of expenses and invoicing is easy with quickbooks online.
awesome. this app is great and extremely helpful with my small business. it saves a lot of time and work. not only do i find it very resourceful but it's easy to use. customizing my invoices and estimates is probably the best part of the application aside from it allowing me to check my profit and loss. i recommend this app to any user, especially a business owner.
. how do i quote in this app?
. sales receipt and invoice not round off available in mobile apps create invoice not show retail invoice and tax invoice in mobile i am a paid version user and i am pc login all options are work properly but mobile apps issue i have made complete 4 tims in call center but agent ask me team work this issue
easy to use. keeps me on top of my expenses every day. should have started using it months ago!
love it. i love the quickbooks program because all of my employees can log into the program from different locations at the same time. it works great with my small business to easily access invoices as well as the payment logs.
is this a lite version? where are the other features?. the features included in the app are good, but i wish it was a bit fuller. it's like a lite version. more capability with a paid add maybe?
. would be great if you could actually see activity on vendors or customers instead of just there profile. have had this app for 3 years now and has never fully synced only pulls up a quarter of the information that you see online.
. says an update is available and exits, while an update doesn't exist. given how overpriced qbo is, would be nice if the android app worked...and was half as nice as the ios equivalent.
doesn’t let you do self assessment tax. this app only does my business tax return, and whilst it doesn’t explicitly promise more, because it doesn’t let me do my self assessment (buy to let) it means i still need another app to do this. and an account on top. being such a major tax app, the fact it can’t deal with all my tax matters is a major fail.
does the job. great app for fast results
. this app has changed the way i do business for the better. i can update invoices, check profit reports, and so much more very easily.
great app!. at first, i thought that this app was pretty clunky and i didn't enjoy using it. in the last couple of years or so, it has gotten considerably better. i really like using it now.
content lacking. content and information through the app is basically useless. there are no features available for in depth data reporting. absolutely atrocious if not using a laptop.
touchid?. would be nice if app supported touchid since it will not save your password and logs you off automatically.
mobile genius. i'm on the road most of the time. being able to check invoices, write them and get paid is invaluable. it takes a little time to get the hang of, but once you do, it rocks.
awesome app. this is a brilliant app. i have all my invoices and expenses at my fingertips. very easy to use and synchs perfectly with qbo on my mac. keeps me on track with daily reminders of overdue invoices. no one gets away with not paying me now.
love this app!. easy to use on the go!
can't do my expenses on the app. i've started using quickbooks a few months ago. all was going ok but now i can't do my expenses on my app anymore. can't take pictures of my receipts to add them to my expenses. i contacted them and they said they are dealing with it but still no luck after a few weeks waiting. very frustrating. all other functions are working fine though. depe
. great customers support
good if you use quickbooks for limited functions. lacks access to a lot of what exists in the full browser experience. particularly frustrating that not only can you not create a po, you cannot view them. other simple stuff missing or not quite matched up as far as fields being available for adding products, suppliers, customers etc. in light of them increasing their monthly subscription fees, hopefully some money is going to be spent bringing feature parity to their access tools.
. very disappointed, missing 6 months of transactions from my bank, tried to fix it as i was instructed to but couldn't, you can't get someone to speak to, no customer service. big joke, i don't recommend it to anyone
okay. i'm new to doing my own bookkeeping and find this product clunky and not very easy to use. issues with importing transactions and program changing dates and the order compared to the bank. it's not very easy to see what account transfers are moving tofrom. it's hard to distinguish credits for debits. poor customer service. no good summary graphs. slow to attach receipts. multiple clicks to do basic things. cuts off file names if there too long.
easy, quick & thorough!. love this online version! i've been using it for my business for over a year! we send out about 100 different invoices every month and it's great!
newest update is nothing but problems. can no longer update estimates. freezes and have to close app. also cannot see new estimates fellow employees have created. app ran perfectly prior to the update. intuit needs to launch new update asap or they are losing my business.
. deleting your account is a nightmare!!
missing too much functionality. basic features like looking at an account are missing. my chart of accounts are listed but clicking to view transactions says this account not viewable in the mobile app.
. love that i can send invoices from my phone!
best accounting software i ve used so far.. after using some 10 accounting softwares i ve chosen quickbooks. this the most easiest and best option available in the indian market....and of course most affordable also.
. slow customer service meant i was unable to upgrade from qbse to quickbooks online. tried clear books instead, app is not great but otherwise they are a vast improvement, particularly the bank sync which is so much more reliable. i get the feeling qb have grown too quickly and do not have the infrastructure to support their customers.
not sure yet. too early to rate this app. only second time me using it. ill check back in a couple of months with a more thought out opinion.
. app does not launch on my phone
no support. very disappointed i am no longer able to access p&l or balance sheets on ipad. it’s been over 1 month and still the brain trust cannot make it work...
crashes. app crashes every time i'm using a lg g5 emailed support for help 3 weeks ago no response.sent response never heard back.
don’t use the pay options.. app is great but don’t use the pay option. it took a week for the money to hit my account.
terrible. glitchy. doesn't update new transactions. hard to navigate compared to desktop qbo app. honestly, intuit knows it can do better than this. they're just greedy.
great small business tool. great for sending invoices, tracking due invoices, and emailing with document or pic attachments. cut out a good deal of my paperwork.
basic app. app functions are extremely limited, and i can't use qb web on any browser on ios devices (ipadipad pro 12.9iphone 7plus) as all browsers including safari, chrome and dolphin run in zoomed mode when want to enter invoice, payments, receipts and bills or even check reports and make unusable.
. ok app email invoice doesn't work version 3.8 been unable to send invoices via email for over a week now.
unable to access quickbooks through ipad. everytime time i try to access the quickbooks it says i need to verify first my login which can be verified by sending an email. when i choose this option it says the time has ran out and goes back to the login menu. i am able to get in through the web but never in the app
qb. it would be 5 but i use it on several devices doesn't sync well phone app need more functilnality
. everything is simple and easy to use
. i am unable to see invoices dated back more than a few months. it is also hard to search by name.
. worthless, the accounting app never worked. it kept kicking me out.
. cant add expenses or clients to qb through my smart phone
great update. now i can record my expenses.
better than xero. brilliant app. seamless to use. all of my clients now use it!
. this is of great help! i can update our business transactions anytime, anywhere! thanks! 😊
i can't stand this program. logins don't work most of the time. functionality is severely limited (no expense tracking, no bill entry?! seriously). crashes regularly. horrible customer service.
. rubbish interface, doesnt send invoices when you press send, had multiple invoices paid late due to this, will be looking for a decent online app to run my business. how can an invoice be overdue if my customer never received it because the app sent it? how do i tell if my estimates have actually been sent? its extremely unprofessional having to contact my customers and ask them if they've recieved invoices and expenses because this software is not up to scratch.
. moderate user, nice to estimate and invoice on the go
. great app making it easier to track all of my business finances. and the fact that i can connect it to my other business apps saves me so much time.
quickbooks online for the ipad. it works great!! anywhere at anytime. create your customers, create the estimate and then bill it out!! if your smart you will setup the direct payment to your bank account too!!
crashes, isn't sign in. stock nexus 5x. app won't sign in, hangs, now crashes every time.
. enjoying the ease of use. good app!
can't even start the program. i use quickbooks online. when i saw the app, i was excited. i cannot even get past the login screen as it continuously tells me that i have no internet connection (even though i do). if i can't login, the app is useless.
. trola app
it’s 2018. it’s 2018 and still no turbotax integration or automated receipt scanning integration. you still have to manually enter all of the receipt data. if this is about “streamlining” small business time then make things streamlined. no new advances or major improvements in the past 2 years. im in the market for a new system.
. edit 12319: thanks for the fix and newer versions. this app has been updated and expanded to be a powerful tool on the go. crash problem fixed. love qbo i love that this app is a limited version of the qbo for your desktop browser: however, it crashes on start up all the time rendering it useless.
. not able to login to app since one month now.
. wonderful apps but still need to improve .
awesome. a great app that i use frequently to help organize my buisness
like. nice app , liked
quickbooks is genius. i don't normally write reviews for apps. but quickbooks online is simply amazing. i've been using it for over a year and i absolutely love it. i can download transactions from the bank so no boring data entry and can create invoices on the go on my phone. so good.
app lacks functionality. info being offered isn't current 2017 information. try looking up purchase orders per vendor and it displays last years (2016) scattered information. not very useful... this app is only good for sales invoices and p&l reports. that's about it. and who's to say that stuff is even current without double checking with the online database from your computer. payments: unreliable looks like i'm sticking with the gopayment app. just another step to my day to day book keeping tasks...
top notch. this app works great, easy to use after i played around with it for a bit. very convenient and quick to use.
business solutions made simple. it's really great to have such an app to manage the business. the best part is linking the bank account with the quickbooks gives the brilliant touch of managing accounts easily. it's been more than 6 months since i started using. one suggestion is that if they could add the birthday remainders that would be great. recommended for start ups and pioneers.
amazing app. everything in one
excellent. does what it says on the tin.. excellent app. works brilliantly on the ipad, sometimes find it a little sluggish on the iphone but i put that down to the poor wifi we sometimes have and bad signal from phone operator. anyways it's so easy to use and i can produce an invoice there and then and email to the client instantly. don't know why i took so long to move from desktop to quickbooks online.
. not very user friendly. can't enter data easily. the point to download the app was to have an easy access to my account when i am out working or if i have walkups. i will be able to easily send out an invoice or charge a credit card.
owner. i can't add attachments without it freezing. crashes constantly and touch id does not work
. great app. no problems
. app runs extremely slowly and often won't even open. it freezes almost constantly. using a galaxy s8 phone.
can't login. worked fine, but now asking me to login and then keeps saying there's been an error. please fix!
. extremely organized and great looking invoice platform. it's an amazing app.
. i use this for my business and can't imagine going without it. gave a 4star because i wish i had a help guide on the app for certain circumstances.
need other option. need an option for employees that travel to do trip expense that import as a bundle. i use pro premier 2015
". i scanned several receipts and submitted them through the app. they were confirmed by the app as ""added"". half of them are now missing with no explanation of where they went. those receipts were already disposed of. completely unacceptable."
great way to run a business. the way razorsync and quickbooks works together makes it possible for me to have a life after work! there are a few more things that would make life easier but overall a big thumbs up!
works good. easy to use.. it's really easy to file expenses with this. that's all i really need a mobile accounting app for.
. limited bank support. no good for personal finance. not many german banks supported.
does not work. i have just spotted an ad on the bus in london. installd the app. created an account. it was difficult to activate my account as the app does not read sms itself. all in all, after logon the carches  it is not unable at all. i use galaxy s6.
. love it very helpful and easy to use looks very professional for estimates and invoices
great for in the field. love the app. it would be even better if you could use the reoccurring invoice list from the app.
. i was not aware that you needed their main subscription of $25 per month to access this extra monthly charge. also i am still being charged my one month payment for thinking i could use this on my andeoid only and signing up. not impressed for a co.pany i worked with their software for years. now like microsoft, it's a money grab with subscriptions. sad. loved them for years.
lowered rating. gave it 4 stars last year. since then it is completely unreliable and almost useless.
. it's a great app for the phone.
. good program, app needs to be able to modify more though like the desktop version
needs updates. same app. works okay but very limited functionality. i figured since online version was updated they would've made changes here too. disappointed at how's long it's taking qb to add accounting functionality to this app.
. not a bad app
lousy service. spent all morning trying to upload an expense only to be told i had no internet connection. can't it determine i have no server connection? so most of the morning i spent in one que after another and finally hanging up. i must say that the convenience of being mobile outweighed the inconvenience of not having too much versatility, but only if i am able to be mobile. i hate wasting time, and so i want payback.
. lots of odd problems. invoices dissapering invoices with same number invoice not adding correctly.
not great but ok. i gave a review a few years ago when the online version first came out and it was bad. they resolved many of the issues and now it runs really well. i don't have any crashes can do almost everything that my laptop version online can do. i highly recommend it.
useless. the app keeps crashing, if you’re in the middle of typing a long estimate or creating an invoice, it crashes and your file is gone, you have to keep saving your project, otherwise when it crashes, your project is gone. very disappointed, going to a different app or software at the beginning of the year, three years with this crap, paying high monthly rates, and for nothing.
awesome. makes life so much easier. at home or on go.
crashes when downloading. crashes when downloading after initial setup. have not been able to use app. disappointing.
simplicity. this app has only gotten better and better with each update.
application ios. bonjour, enfin l’application ios a quand les prochaines mise à jour ? 1 adresse d’expédition inexistant dans les factures et les devis ? 2 impossible accéder au facture qui se trouve dans les brouillons 3 impossible de rapprocher les opérations avec la banque en ligne 4 impossible de mettre des pièces jointe dans les factures et devis
. horrible, did not notify of subscription issue. data entered not commited to database. double charged my credit card. terrible customer service (james refusing a last name or initial from customer care) experience, nothing resolved. no response from error logs. called and even gave control of my computer. never did intuit offer any fix. ongoing issues over 6 months damaging my business.
needs more work. how about an already paid check box ? also an option for tax inclusive default would be nice. it would save half the time making an invoice if it had these options.
. having a horrible time with quick books. everytime i try to start the free trial just to check efficiency of the app so that i can go purchase it. but as soon as i go to enter the company name the app hangs and closes off.
flawed. i am going to reinstall the old app. the new app will not allow me to add a customer from my phone's contact list.
subscription bug driving me crazy!. for the last few weeks the quickbooks app has been unusable! it alerts me that my subscription has expired and will lock me out of any activities. i have been on the phone with tech support, my subscription is up to date, it gets fixed for a day and then the problem re emerges the next day. this is an excellent app when this problem does not exist. i use a fully updated ipad pro. please fix this bug!
love it. great app, couldnt do anything without it!
. you should make the interface exactly the same as the desktop version. we don't mind paying more for online, knowing that we constantly get updates, and logon capabilityfrom any computer and can have the online backups. but having the desktop vs online being totally different and opposite from eachother is annoying. i will give 5 stars when this changes.
. is it possible to link this app with my desktop quickbooks software?
utter crap. if i could give no stars i would app crashes all the time won't send invoices to customers i have had for years have been struggling on with quickbooks for several years but now can't take the frustration anymore caused by this utter waste of money.
. great product easy to use and understand. not complicated at all make changes view reports and see everything clearly.
. great accounting for reasonable price... fairly user friendly
great. awsome when on the road, good functions available. overall solid app. definitely comes in handy
so much better. intuit have certainly listened to there customers and have massively improved the app with some recent updates. so much better and easier to use than before. well done intuit finally glad a huge company has finally listened to its customers
. great app for billing lets you work right from your phone
disaster to sign out. i happened to see this app and found it is interesting to scan invoices but turns to be that i have to be a “company” to use it and have to pay so much for it! so expensive!!!!!!
. would be nice to be able to record deposits through the app. the whole reason i have this app is so i don't have to go onto a pc. also, an option for digital payment, ie paypal venmo etc.
. great app wish it was free for small home based enterprises
no support for canadian tax system. intuit's quickbooks for web does not support the canadian tax system. not sure why this app is appearing in the canadian app store.
great. i love this app. it does what i need.
thuglife23. i be countin ma hunnit dolla billz easy up in this bictch
fire the entire team. worst app. login doesn't work. recovery doesn't work. craptastic adventure
extremely limited, useless. inability to enter time activity which is basic functionality that’s extremely useful on mobile.
nice app. nice app, quick and easy. smart invoices and bank matches. i don't like paypal, so wouldn't use that payment option.
love using quickbooks!!. i love using it and it makes my business so easy and don't even need to carry my computer. i can actually do all of my invoices estimates anytime anywhere with my cell phone!
excellent. excellent app
getting better.... last used this bout a year ago. i dunno if it's me or the app but it seems much more intuitive now.
. this program will not let me separate my inactive accounts from my active accounts. also navigation is not intuitive to me.
. you need this app if your running a business
". so broken that the ""report an issue"" button doesn't even work. login takes multiple tries, vendor activities are all empty, clearing cache does not help, android back buttom exits the app without even a confirmation. as much as i enjoy using the website, this app is pure frustration."
. i am sara. i am new to social media. i found it to be useful aka practical here.
. mindful movers uses quickbooks. very simple.
great app.. wonderful!
not reliable. app logged you out while you’re still driving or doesn’t log you when you need it to. this used to be a great app but then this glitch happen with it not logging in and logging you out when you don’t want it to and when you contact customer service there’s no help other than delete the app and redownload it relogin yeah that doesn’t work.
mgrm. great app. useful and easy to use.
great when working. this app is a great app , however every time that apple do an update it seems to cause issue in regards to the program recognising that you have a up to date subscription
great app. everything you need to do is at your fingertips.
fair at what it does. still lacks time entry, which remains a problematic task for new and occasionally seasoned employees using our tablets on the shop floor since qbo time entry mode does not support mobile browsers and uses a antiquated interface. can not issue or do anything with po's. will not refresh bank data (from bank).
roofing business. i have been using quickbooks for almost a year for my husband roofing business and i love it! why we are out looking at jobs i can do an invoice on my phone and email it right away to the customer! and i can go home and work from laptop as well! i recommend quickbooks for book keeping for business!
. simple to use and quick
excellent. quickbooks online works great for me and makes my work much easier especially with the phone app
. great app. would like to see a banking tab like online.
quickbooks online plus. loving the new updates with invoice tracking and the ease of excepting credit cards in the app. getting paid is easier and quicker than ever.
it's got some great ideas however. ... i think there is so much potential here but....it all drops off cause any time i've sent an invoice it drops it and i have to resend several times. it took 3 months to be able to connect to my bank and there are a few other issues. not sure yet if i'm going to cancel or not.
not great. there are multiple problems wrong with this program. you can't bill a customer when you attach a receipt which means i constantly have to switch between devices. my expenses according to the customer are incorrect. i'd like to see my estimateinvoice minus my expenses per job. the only reason i switched to this program from freshbooks, which is way less expensive and more user friendly is because quickbooks has a balance sheet, which our accountant required.
refund made impossible. i’ve been making payment on this stupid app not using it at all. there’s no easy way to refund or unsubscribe this stupid app. who do i bring the attention to since quickbook site says they have nothing to do with the billing and subscription?
. app stopped syncing transactions, useless!
extremely slow. painfully slow on both my mobile device and macbook. also, i have to refresh the app over and over to see the latest data. that wasn’t the case before. when i opened the app, it used to show the new data.
. does not work well with android. the keyboard covers the buttons which kept me stuck when creating an invoice. invoices cannot be sorted by invoice numbers. why?!
. monthly charge. i'm sure the app works great, but there's no mention of a fee until they have your information.
update terrible. completely broken at this point. searching for a viable alternative
no refund and help support was clueless.. called twice no one could help me and both phone numbers proved useless. billing support was not helpful. could not even locate my ipad online subscription thru itunes. waste of time and money in my experience.
highly recommend this app. i have a mobile veterinary service and use this for all of my billing while i'm on the road. it saves me time by allowing me to bill my clients on site at the time of service, and even process the credit card if they choose to pay that way.
awesome app. awesome app very convenient use it on a daily basis.
bad program. won't send estimates and invoices. buisness cash flow has been screwed up.
confused. unlike using my laptop to filter purchases, payments, and deposits the app is extremely confusing and when purchases are made you cannot view them live or even see previous ones, instead i have to spend a lot of time logging them in. i purchased the quickbooks online through my laptop in hopes that the app would make my accounting easier by using my phone, as i do not have time to constantly log into my laptop. the app is too time consuming and confusing.
. i don't usually write reviews, i always dread using the app. i have a lot of receipt that i need to add to expenses. it's a big effort to find the right transaction and add the receipt. it's painful to juggle between banking transaction and expenses. if usability of the app doesn't improve it's enough for me to pay extra and move to xero.
good resource. i will update this as i see necessary, haven't made a customer service call yet. but overall the navigation is something to get used to because it's very in depth and many details that you would expect are included with the software.
owner. quickbooks online, so far we like everything about except for the fact that it works like crap on an ipad. please come out with an update and patch work soon it's not worth it.
. awesome app makes life simple for small businesses
disaster. was forced to use qb online due to always changing fees for desktop version. always crashes. hard to use. terrible. wish i could use another program. new version has new colours!! yay so practical!! doesn’t accommodate qc payroll deductions like cssnt but that’s ok, it’s colourful. intuit idiots.
great app. absolutely helpful and useful
please fix it !. with ios13 the app is crashing all the time , for example when a i select a client immediately crash
convenient but you pay for it. this app is really handy but they jack the prices up on you once you’ve gone through all the hassle of inputting your info. they know you won’t probably mess with changing programs once you’ve wasted all that time and energy. it is nice to use, however.
bitch ur fucked. all over culiacan and the net
brilliant. used other software apps before now and this one knocks socks off them, can access all my account details and add bills and send invoices so much easier during the day now, knocks about 30minutes a night off my admin
. very useful for small and midam business company
meh, no project profitability reports in the app. as a construction business all our accounting revolves around p&l reports per project. the onlinedesktop app gives us the project report but the app does not, which makes the app pretty much useless. our best solution is to login to our qbo account through safari on the phone to see the real time project profitability, shouldn’t the app do that?
. interface not good compared to the ios version.
very good!. really does help to keep everything at your finger tips, it's a convenient way to keep track of your earnings and invoices. one quick glance and you know where your company is at! 👍🏻
great work!. the app works great and is a very useful tool for on the go business matters. i have not yet figured out how to add single time activities on the app ... not sure this feature is available. but other then that it's great!
great app!. so easy to use, really makes a difference to be able to invoice and do payments on the move.
. no need for a secretary qb does it all
awesome app. easy to use. intuitive. great mobile app.
. best accounting app ever
small business owner. this app is perfect! 100% of what i need all the time!
. great app, does everything i need while out and about. makes evening paperwork easier.
doesn’t keep track of suppliers. this app works fine as long as you only want to send novices. unfortunately it doesn’t tell what you owe your suppliers and allow you to pay their bills, so while you are running around invoicing clients the suppliers will be sending the bailiffs round to your office.
freezes all the time. it will kick me out several times in a session and it freezes up and doesn't save the work that i have done. not very user friendly for newcomers.
beware price increases.. i love the functionality, but i've had two price increases since becoming a subscriber to the online service. the entire point of a subscription model is so that the company has a sustained income in order to continue developing and my costs stay fixed every month. this isn't acceptable so i'll be looking for other solutions soon.
dispatcher. i can actually keep up with calls now with this mobile app
love this app. couldn't see running my business without it!!
works great. works great for my small business. not sure why there are bad reviews, qbo keeps up with my customers information, invoices, and estimates. very easy to use. now on this last update, i did have to uninstall and reinstall on my andriod phone, but within 5 minutes i was back up and running.
useless since update. the last update brings a gorgeous splash screen. i know this because i see it dozens of times each day since i have to log in every time i open the app! completely useless now.
changed the way we do business. i love this app. we needed something that we could easily use in the field. we can create estimates, invoices, receive payments and even attach check images to those payments. our productivity has skyrocketed. quickbooks has figured out the mobile accounting software. customers for life.
. brilliant app filled with bugs. trying to email invoices and get endless waiting screen. try and update contact details and it cant upload the details. sort it out or im off as im sure most others will be.
great app. very user friendly. easy to edit and add customers.
needs features. app seems to get bug fixes but vary rarely does it get new features. as a mobile professional i would like to have the same features in the app as on the computer. currently investigating other more powerful mobile options vs quick books update: can't even enter expenses with the app only a pc! in the usa they can enter expenses with the app.... wish i could deduct an extra star just for that.
"cool expenses feature allows upload of receipt  needs croppdf tool. one of the best parts of the app is the ""expenses"" feature, which allows you to enter all of the details of an expense on the go, including the expense account, how you paid (credit card, etc), and any memodescription of the transaction. i'd like to see the image upload function in expense allow for cropping, and even better, auto pdf conversion with cropping, like the camscanner app"
wow! loving the switch!. it's more than i had ever expected. using square or other solutions or good old fashion checks in the mail are nothing compared to how seamless qbo has made my life. that mac app, ipad app, iphone app and even the apple watch app give me the pulse on our company that i've needed for so long. can't wait to grow into more solutions with qbo!
. great app, love throwing away receipts just take a picture of the expense, document it, and bam, you're done.
. i like the app, but i can't view all of the vendor bills and payments on the mobile app. i've tried multiple android and ios devices and just can't see the vendor bills and payments. i can see them online, but it would be nice to be able to view them in the app as well.
. easy to use, simple and the lack of paper is a plus
crashes constantly. i hate the mobile app so much. i will be talking with a customer and try to pull up their account and then it will freeze and crash. the worst.
getting better. you can keep doing more and more on phone. great for us small business owners. it would be 5 but when i first downloaded there was not a lot to transactions you could complete on app.
problem with account.. website says i got android subscription. android says i dont. account about to expire and there isn't a easy or direct way to renew... guess it will be running out
do not switch. if you use tradition quickbooks, do not switch. you will be very disappointed with the lack of simple features that are standard on traditional versions.
love it. makes accounting and payroll and taxes and everything a complete nobrainer.
. this app isn't ready for primetime. used to work better. the reconciliation doesn't work if you need to hit the back button on any transaction no matter how many you approve before it. completely frustrating and gets worse with time.
. the service online is terrific. the app errors anytime i try to update from my smartphone for over a month now. support is unresponsive via email.
business. i'm very happy with this app help me a lot
. am trying to login, wont let me, technical problems. i have all my expenses in there...
. so far so good. only been using for a short time and still getting to grips with things. will update as i go.
". quickbooks is okay but the app is bad. won't ever let me log in the screen just hangs on ""hang on, we are getting your quickbooks data"" and then says that it can't connect..."
it could use some improvements. i would like to have the option to send partial invoices from the app
gary stanton. this app means i can seem to know what i am doing, it actually works for me.
quickbooks. absolutely great piece of software making my business so much easier to run.
. a very good app for accounting. has made my life better.
. would be 5☆ if only they'd allow a workorder between estimate & invoice.
junk. won't sign in crashes in sign in screen
multiple currencies. it should support multiple currencies. can't key in expenses that are not in my home currency
. always having an error notice when signing in
ceo of gd2k. this is a really good app it has help our business in so many ways. it help boost our profit margin we have been able to close deals, and make invoices right on the spot. i recommend this for a lot of different business with quickbooks online.
invoice won’t work with ios 13. i’m trying to put a new customer in on a invoice and the app just turns black and white screen. plz update! i run my entire business off this app
keeps me on track. i'm so happy with qb. makes estimates, invoices and takes payment. that's what's most important to me. haven't used it to pay my bills yet. i'll explore it later. wish i could set alarms to do estimate followup. would be so helpful
. so far this is okay still need to learn
. love this app
. i operate two companies through the app and notice that suppliers and customers from one company end up being listed in the other! i would give more stars, but this is a glaring issue that needs resolving urgently.
best for my business. the package has everything that my small business requires. many thanks.
great app. love the details and ability to invoice or add customers on the go!
rp. would love to be able to print invoices from my phone. is this an option?
fix needed. over all ok program... the problem is you can get an error, saying deposit on hold. not your problem as a user, the user did nothing wrong. and quickbooks will not fix it. your account balance will be off and no way to fix it. all quickbooks fault and they don't care, support it or fix it! very bad customer service!!!
rubbish. absolutely rubbish since the last update . keeps crashing on iphone xr. screen message = app needs to close due to critical updates. happens 2030 x times a day when trying to set up an invoice estimate etc. test your updates before release you them, you idiots!
19.11.2 awful update. first thing i noticed was there is no search bar for customers, so i have to scroll through thousands of customers to find the one i’m looking for. secondly, i had hoped that we’d be able to view estimates and invoices in landscape mode to see them better, nope. then, when i tried to navigate back to the main customer list, there’s no back button! this version was nowhere near ready to be released.
i love it!. works great! love the accessibility, i use the app to send invoices easily while i'm on the go and my clients can pay online, through the invoices i send them. definitely worth every penny!!
. easy to use, nononsense basic accounting software that even firsttimers like myself can master. smooth invoicing, affordable, all you could really ask for. not as fancy as se other accounting software out there but then again, for a sole trader like me, more than sufficient.
sssloooow so very slow. latest update takes forever to load splash screen about 8 seconds then face id happens fast then loading data: no problems. just takes for ever on the front side to get going.
can't even start the program. i use quickbooks online. when i saw the app, i was excited. i cannot even get past the login screen as it continuously tells me that i have no internet connection (even though i do). if i can't login, the app is useless.
so easy to use. such a great platform to use. i can easily work remotely or at home and have no issues. as a finance professional i recommend quickbooks to anyone who is a non accountant
user friendly. love how easy it is to invoice clients
. great used old quick book enjoying this although i don't find it as easy to navigate my way around.
nice interface, would like more features. works well for basic tasks. needs a few more features to be really helpful.
great app but not perfect yet. if they add more customization to this app like adding letterhead to purchase order and provide educational videos on every topic it would make a best app ever.
can't log in.. it worked with my old phone. since i upgraded to an lg g5, i can't use it.
. great app
quickbooks review. i'm just getting started and i'm definitely not a detail oriented person. quickbooks (so far) has made it very easy to input and the ability to link accounts makes it very simple.
great app!!. i love it! this program has totally transformed our family business!!
taking too long to integrate with desktop version and ask for id code almost every time. still not as useful as the desktop version. also extremely frustrated having to get a code to identify myself almost every time i go to log in. have now decided it is easier to tether the laptop to the ipad.
excelente aplicación. tengo un negocio de control de plagas y esta aplicación me a permitido realizar cotizaciones y facturas mientras estoy fuera de la oficina.
quick books. awsome app. helps when your always on the go.
love it. great app
. great accounting app
expenses. how do add an expense thats on a 30 or 60 day account?
payroll. it is worthless for me. uninstalled it as soon as it was installed. can't do payroll.
working great. seem to be doing really well. some things are better done on desktop but for the most part can do a invoice from phone and accept payments.
can't get anything!. i use qb at home and this app does not bring up any information that is needed. very frustrating when on the go. please fix!!!
app problems. app keeps crashing haven’t been able to create invoices for days
help. the android app is very very slow it takes a long time to change a estimate to a invoice i have emailed support several times about the issue with no reply please speed it up.
. the app is horrible. doesn't update ky information, ia like a month behind. very frustrating. you are good at billing me every month, that part is up to date🙄.
. mobile invoicing, categorizing expenses, pandl, ect. powerful. get it to save money and sky rocket efficiency in business. sooo good!
great app. for on the go consultants, this is amazing. get paid faster by sending an invoice right after a service visit.
. great app to managing income and expenses
quick books. your small business fiance organization and report app.do all your small business tasks from here.
how to raise downloads by 10 times?. how to raise downloads by 10 times? service, daily installs can reach 3000+. ping me at skype& whatsapp:+8615282351612 facebook:aso888. every one can get a test promotion for 3 days now!
. too often getting experiencing technical difficulties when trying to login.
. horribly unresponsive and buggy. lacks feature parity with ios.
prestige fleet maintenance. would love to be able to have card transactions go through quicker. takes 34 days then additional 12 days to be deposited in my account about a week waiting on money is hard for a start up business. would love next day deposits! other than that i like the system!
. makes my job so much easier
very nice!. i love have this power in my phone! i can email invoices or print them out, all on my phone! this app is easy to learn and soooooo fast when you get used to it. there was a lot of thinking when they designed this app, wow
. awful customer service
great app. i'm a new business owner and i couldn't have been successful without this app!!
. good app
new update 1120. your new update is garbage. app shuts down immediately when it’s opened.
. very fine app
. dreadful experience so far. bought qb 16th dec 2019 and cant get a call back from an english speaker to help me with set up despite multiple attempts! why is sales uk based but support isnt? this is 2nd review  1st disappeared!!! so disappointed and very desperate to get started. i can login to qb online but says im in usa not uk please tell me who to email in response qb
. love it! hard to navigate at first but you get the hang of it.
super cool. i have it with me know on the go and the reporting is also cool. had some challenges as the i initially bought the app through apple but once the i was migrated, problem was solved. i can't stop talking about this app to friends and colleagues. is there a bonus for referring people?
great app. this does everything i need it to do!
excellent on ipad, good on iphone. i use this app on my ipad and iphone, it's pretty good on the iphone but it's darned good on the ipad. hopefully they will develop more features on both over time as it's still not a total replacement for the web browser version.
app crashes constantly. i used to love this app. the last couple of months the app crashes daily and multiple times. i’m in the middle of working and the app says critical updates are needed and logs me out. i’m extremely frustrated with this considering i pay over $20month to use this software across all my devices. no resolution or contact from customer service. it happens almost weekly. what a nightmare. looking for alternatives.
crashes every time i try to open anything.. i hate this app.
quickbooks. does exactly what on tin. takes fair bit to set up but boy its worth it
app can’t find our data. we are days into this app not being able to access our data: accounting, banking, billing. access is only available through certain browsers on a laptopdesktop. the support team is friendly and wished me luck.
keeps getting better and better!. indispensable for small businesses. qb online and ipads are a big part of our ability to maintain triple digit growth year over year.
power super app. superb..safe my time
occasional early glitches with mobile overall v good. i use the mobile version and it's access to my phone contacts makes it really good. there have been a few minor glitches with support but this is getting better and better  so apart from the few minor glitches early on then it would be getting 5⭐️ latest update after 6 months  excellent 5 ⭐️
limited functionality. the app has very little of the on line functionality. and the on line version of qb has less functionality than the desktop pro version that i used previously. very much regret going to the on line version.
"too many free apps for me to pay for this service!!. if they are a ""top developer"" then make a free version with limited functionality for basic users like myself and a full subscription app for small business owners like your competitors do."
. as a selfemployed individual, you get no support. do not buy. wasted over two hours on the phone with various customer service reps and was informed that you get online support. lost three weeks of work in few mins. they won't even give me refund. wish i can give negative stars!!!
. some features only available through the desktop dashboard ...
. quick and convenient full service bookkeeping app for my small business!
. account function is good . but technical support & help customer service is poor, not responding. wrost app
. extremely easy to use. great app to create and send invoices and accept payments, track business and personal spending... and it's all in one place. plus lots more.
. great app
please fix it. is freezing and scratching often
. great app for small business. easy to use and saves me a ton of time doing my accounting. accounts payable and receivable couldn't be easier. i really like the free bank transfer option i can provide my customers in their invoices. taxes are quicker and easier thanever everything is in one place and no more collecting receipts. i highly recommend quickbooks to anyone running a small business.
"don't bother. it says above ""get full access to everything quickbooks online has on the web"". but in fact it is a totally different application geared to salesmen on the road. don't expect to see your accounts here, all you have is:  customers  estimates  your invoices and sales receipts. very disappointing; forget it"
great tool for any business.. i like quickbooks online period. the app is great. as owner of the company, i value being able to monitor whats going on financially with the business while i'm on the go. i would highly recommend getting away from the software version of quickbooks and switching to qb online just for this app.
why use the app when you it lacks the features of the website. you can’t change the status of in invoice on the app and must be done online only. this is a major flaw in the app. once i do my taxes i will no longer be using quick books, because of the enforced complexity the system is rendered mostly useless. the app needs to have complete functionality of the site.
desktop should be same as app. great app but a shame that the desktop version dies not have the same functionality
easy to use. great app! gives me most things i need to know on the go. however, i wish it would show me revenueexpense charts.
garbage. i still can't login since last updated. it's been a freaking month
. great app very convenient and allows me to manage my accounts on the road. i have a business where i am always out driving and the app saves me a lot of time & it allows me to get things done while i'm out of the office.
love it. great app
great app. coming from microsoft office, i enjoy quickbooks so much. it is so mobile and easy to use. there have been a few questions i had, but a quick search led me to the answer. i recommend the program and the app.
i really like it.. works great. easy to use. a business must have! (1) suggestion is being able to lock in and automatically applying sales tax to invoices. now we have to apply it manually for each item.
. great app
. the easy access to my qb account has been great to keep a pulse on the business as well as getting cash expenses in before i forget about them.
where is the option to invoice % of jobs.. i’m a painting contractor and i’ll do $100,000 job and be invoicing progress payments along the way and do not have the ability to invoice for percentage of the job that’s complete. it be nice to see that option in quickbooks online
. dashboard is broken!! loads but shows up blank. i can see things in the activity page but everything else doesn't work!! please fix this. i'm running android 10
greatest app ever. i love the “capture receipt” feature. makes life a whole lot easier.
love it and support intuit provides. very convenient app for expensing. had an issue crashing while logging in and customer support was very quick to respond.
qb app is useless. i’ve been quickbooks user for a long time and discovered this app gives a totally different set of numbers than quickbooks online does. expenses are different than real version so please beware, you can’t trust the numbers. contacted support to no avail. i guess they don’t read the other reviews either.
. ceashes all the time, does weord stuff with data, doesnt save lots of bugs on android
partial functionality. every time i need to produce or view an invoice qb says i need to use web version because of register items that cannot be viewed. so basically ios version is not productive.
love the desktop version. the app needs work.. limited functionality. i can't even update the credit card i use to pay quickbooks in the app. tough to send invoices to clients
really frustrating app. very frustrating app both on iphone and qbo. very glitchy and customer support is terrible. if the they didn't force you to use a subscriptionbased model, i'd use the installable version on quickbooks. i'm sure other have less problems, but it has not been a good experience for myself or my company.
it gets better and better. i was a huge sceptic (i have been a pro advisor for several years)and very had a very negative opinion of qb online. that was until a couple of years ago when i attended a presentation of the capabilities of the software. i was sold on its usefulness and have been using and recommending it ever since. qb online adds important features regularly. buy it!!! you won't be disappointed
great accounting app. very happy with my quickbooks app.
worst in india. i install it after that i it not support in india can you suggest me other options for android
this has helped me have a life. without this software i would be buried in paperwork . it helps me stay organized. i have been using one version or another since 2003. thank you
not pleased. i put the qb online app on my new ipad thinking i wouldn't have to lug my laptop around the country anymore.... it does not have the functionality or settings i need in canada. it's made for the states, which normally isn't a huge deal because we are very similar. but i couldn't input my tax codes or even my province! lame........
need to be able to add bills and accept transactions’s that should match to bills. i think the title says it all. qbo is amazing such a great product but the app needs more functionality. mainly the bills, i need to add a bill from my phone and then be able to match multiple bills as one payment to relevant bills on payment. so frustrating having to find a computer to do this.
. effectively useless. crashes after tapping on anything
quickbook online plus. it's alright. i hope u can work on the invoice template options to add: * individual discount% column for each input * additional description column * additional customized invoice number top rhs * ability to change currency on the invoice itself * add exchange rate manually
i like it because of the receipt picture. some areas need getting use to
makes me look like a pro!. i'm just a dude that runs a small business. i'm good at what i do, but i'm not an accountant or bookkeeper. quickbooks online let's me do what i'm good at and not worry about the details.
needs improvement. the bottom line is its a half attempt at a usable app the key features such as updating and access to registers don't work and the work around snare to tedious
very beneficial app. this is a very beneficial app. it does not replace the pc version but is an excellent aid. it's helpful to send invoices on the go or at the end of a service call. the sooner the customer pays the more chance you will get paid. as long as you keep things simple it is a very good aid!
. very good app
still can’t attach a receipt. even after the most recent update, i still can’t attach a photo of a receipt. i can select the photo from my library, but the save button has been missing since the last ios update.
great service. login problems.. live this service. just got a new phone (note 4). cannot login. i get emailpassword error. i've reset my password several times and can login online just fine.
very unintuitive. is hard to tell which expenses are finalized which ones aren't. it's just not a very friendly interface.
missing deductions!!. the main reason i’d want to use the app is unfortunately not available in france photographing any expense receipts i have and immediately entering in deductions when i make purchases. until this part of the app isn’t migrated over to the french version, the app is almost totally worthless to me. so bummed. however 3 stars because the app runs smoothly in what it does, even if you can really only enter sales and receive payments.
incredibly glitchy. the app is glitchy despite updates. i’m not super impressed by intuit in general. i use their payroll for my business, a lot of glitches there too. app crashes or spontaneously exits my selections to “accept” for no reason and i have to start over. does not learn well, i have to reteach things over and over.
user friendly. this app is so nice when i am out and about getting good items for our business i can input them right then and there. i don't have to come home a do it, sometimes i forget then i get unorganized and have missing receipts that i later find. i love this app.
owner light it up. cannot login iphone 6s qb update will not download properly can't get into customer information what the cuss😡😡
billing. i subcribe my licence but i can't do billing ...or even upgrade online ??
. don't like that you have update in order to open app.
. great app. no problems
viewable. error message on download is gone, but the app lacks functionality like syncing bank data and the payroll app doesn't allow me employee editing options. if i need to see what is happening in quickbooks its all right, but it's definitely not quickbooks online mobile version
. i haven't been able to update a draft invoice via mobile in over 2 years and it's been a known issue? instead of adding new reports all the time, work on the basics please.
. can't log in, useless!
. great app to use along side quickbooks online. i like being able to send estimates and invoices on my mobile device with the quickbooks app!
. a sham of a company, that don't care if your data goes missing, or you have to waste hours of your life rebuilding expenses and mileage data from other sources. the app isn't reliable, doesn't integrate with your other accounting and it's difficult to use. steer clear.
perfect. this is a great app and works perfect for my business
. great app for small business
excelente. es una app genial me a facilitado el trayecto administrativo un 100%
works well and good value. we migrated from the desktop version and that was relatively easy to do and the online version is cost effective and does what it says on the tin! it's great that it's on my phone and ipad as well as desktop gives me access when i need it. no issues so far and the support is good.
ios 13 crash. an awful app that is made even less useful in ios13 because it just crashes straight after running.
great. app used to be useless while desktop version did what i needed. now app is highly functional and i use it constantly for my business. great, reasonably priced. i highly recommend.
great app. the app is great for on the move and for keeping you up to date on invoice payments, you believe you can invoice from the app but we only use it for day to day updates
easy to use. with our business at the end of our fingertips, quickbooks provides the ease required to manage our income and expenses quickly and effortlessly. having used most of the other leading brands, we find this is the best by far!
disaster. was forced to use qb online due to always changing fees for desktop version. always crashes. hard to use. terrible. wish i could use another program. new version has new colours!! yay so practical!! doesn’t accommodate qc payroll deductions like cssnt but that’s ok, it’s colourful. intuit idiots.
two thumbs up!. have only been using for about 30 minutes and has made my business 1000x easier!
paypal integration very poor. quickbooks say it integrates with paypal and automatically downloads transactions. well, it does partly, but doesn't download into expenses the transaction fees with paypal here, meaning you have to do it manually. it will do it for an online purchase to the same account so why it doesn't work properly is a complete mystery and one support do not help with.
. why does it keep saying that there is technical difficulties in using the app? even before prior update, it had this issue. no issue with the ios app though
. fantastic app! so easy to use and send invoices in seconds. love it!
. overall a great app. wish quoted were an option on the dashboard rather than accessing them from invoices then customers.
boost to my business image with my ipad!. i went from handwriting every estimate, sales receipt and invoice to bringing in new paperless technology. at the end of the day i would have to have my wife input everything in our quick books online. then file everything in our office. it's not only impressive to our clients, but it also eliminates filing and an extra step of data entry, it saves time and money and gives you a competitive edge over your competition!
brilliant. excellent accounting software for new small business. only issue i have is that i bought a subscription online and the app keeps telling me to subscribe
. makes life easier!
pretty good..... i'm somewhat of a novice independent contractorpsychotherapist. i've been using quickbooks since 2014 and have been using the app for about a year. the dates of invoice reflect the date of service so this is helpful. i know for sure i do not use all features to their full capacity but it's worth the monthly investment for sure.
. actually very important app for business and its very easy to handle good app.
invoice and estimates not saving after last update. you will have to delete app. then reinstall then it will save.
app is crap. the quickbooks app very rarely lets us sign in and when it does many of the functions do not work. i’ve contacted customer service which is a complete joke. their suggestion was to check out the message board to see who else may have the problem we have! why? how about fix the problem!
best app for my business!. i already have invoicesasap, now i have it's companion, quickbooks! love how they sync and work together to help me understand my finances!
. fantastic app for keeping my expenses up to date on the go and much more!
session expired loop. every time i log in i get a session expired message and logs me out. app is not usable.
office assistant. i am still a huge fan of the desktop version! the one great thing about the qbo is the online feature! it still needs improvements. if you have multi companies you have to pay individual packages for each company and log out to be able to log on the other. there is no switch between companies feature on the phone app like on the desktop and the full qbo site.
. quickbooks is great. i've been using it for a few years. customers can pay directly through their email and it makes keeping track of sales and expenses very easy.
. couldn't run by business without quickbooks online. i love all the integrated features from processing invoices, payroll, and running company financials. i'm liking the new projects feature to examine profit and loss per client per project. i love being a part of priority circle. great value for the cost! i only use the app to review everything at a glance and maybe send invoices. however, it lacks some of the key features from the online version.
worthless app. i was excited to find this app and, unfortunately, downloaded it. i really cannot figure out what is good for other than creating invoices. confusing when you open the app, it does not get better as you get into it, not that there is anything to get into. i run a small non profit & just found this app useless, except for taking up space. what a pity as i have been a qb user for years.
. customer service is absolutely horrible. signed up yesterday online. found out customizing invoices function has been broken for 3 months. call this morning to cancel subscription and get a refund. they're answer basically was we've got your money we're not going to refund it. you have been warned stay away from quickbooks
convenience. i really love the convenience and accessibility of this app and quickbooks online. since switching from desktop pro to this i've been able to keep up with paperwork in the field. i think it's great. i just wish they made an upgrade so i could automatically subtract expenses from specific jobs. having everything separate is a real hassle.
sales tax calculation is wrong. when creating an invoice, the app does not honor customer's sales tax setting. it applies tax even on customers with tax turned off. please fix asap!!!!
doesn't work for ipad. this app doesn't even load my company info. it keeps returning error trying to load company info. i have contacted quickbooks a number of times and all they say is they are working on the issue and to use a web browser version in the mean time. i have seen about 4 updates released and not one of them has fixed this issue. when will this be fixed?
new ios too many bugs. cannot open customer invoices. please correct asap!
frustrated. the is helpful in many ways, but it crashes too much with ipad and locks you out at random times. the screen locks out of focus sometimes too.
love it for our small businesses. love using quickbooks for both our small businesses! makes collecting our invoices and communicating with our customers super easy!
kmec. looks great so far, only a few hours in but promising.
app crashes on splash screen. on iphone 6s plus. this has been happening for so long and there is no action taken. i’ve tried uninstall and reinstall multiple times and nothing is working.
does not function. doesn't load new invoices. app is now useless.
app crashes. everything was great until one day the app crashed. now crashes every time i open it. reinstalled and same issue. help????
keeps crashing in iso 13, can’t even start up. didn’t they have enough time to test before the final release of ios13? minor issues are one thing but the app doesn’t even start, that’s a sev1 that should have been caught long time ago.
. absolutely do not know how i managed my business before this app!
brian peterson remodel. great app. wish i could attach pictures to estimates and invoices using my mobile app.
need a guide. new user here and i need this apps for my business... but i wanna know how to entry my daily sales..
awful. never updates correctly. cannot find my existing customers. just cumbersome. not enough options for menus.. see above frustrations
. i basically keep my accouting up to date with this app. there are functions that i still need my pc for, but i can mostly work from the app.
banking on the go!. it's a great app because i can work from anywhere.
bills for suppliers cannot be viewed. as the title suggests. this is a big negative point for me.
needs more... this app needs to have the ability to process statements. then we would not need to use a computer at all. i was expecting to not to need a computer anymore and be completely self sufficient using my ipad or iphone. otherwise it is ok. statements is a huge thing for me.
absolutely inconsistent. probably the worst app i had on my phone. i have deleted it. it gives incorrect, inconsistent notifications. it’s completely useless to access certain parts of qbo. how incredibly unfortunate that intuit can’t build an app that can compare with the advances made in qbo.
. after upgrading to lg g6 the app no longer works. can't even get it to load. reinstalled, rebooted still nothing.
better than before. i like the ability to record expenses on the fly and take a picture of the receipt. would be better if the smart logic time saving features in quickbooks online were incorporated.
. not very user friendly. can't preview invoices. can't load tax keeps giving errors. can't setup invoice layout with logo ect.... already paid in advance but can't use it.
good, but could be great!. it doesn't allow you to giveoffer a customer discount (% off the customers bill). it also doesn't transfer the customer notes from estimates to the final invoice. we have to copy & paste or write the description all over again. otherwise, it's pretty user friendly.
. it makes creating estimates simpler. i used to fumble my way thru, now it's simple and fun!
. this app isn't ready for primetime. used to work better. the reconciliation doesn't work if you need to hit the back button on any transaction no matter how many you approve before it. completely frustrating and gets worse with time.
. excellent app can do more on the app on android then on the iphone. works great!!
made my job way easier. been really useful for creating invoices and collecting payments for our company!
not easy to use. simple tasks like entering a transaction are complex. app and online qb have a slow response when tapping things. just overall frustrating trying to switch from desktop qb to the app and online qb.
no good. this app only works if you have the online account version
. the apps always crashes!
great as an assistant to the desktop version.. i've found this app to be a great mobile partner to the full desktop (or online) version. there's a couple functions that aren't available in the app but everything you do need is easily available. i can't connect my bank account because my (non us) bank isn't listed but being able to input expenses as they happen is a great way of keeping updated accounts. reconciliation is a breeze afterwards. it's a great app.
. excellent accounting software for my business and my clients. it makes my job very easy
great app. love this app
. with no access to the register and a very clunky interface the app is very difficult to use. it is far from useless but also far from essential.
terrible. terrible functionality. doesn’t process many transactions. don’t buy.
great app. far easier to use than desktop quickbooks. great software
loved it. does exactly what you want. needs more access to desktop features but generally great app
many issues.... most of the time they come up with an update it does not work well after we update the app. they should test this updates before releasing it.
it's a good app. very convenient. the mobile app isn't perfect, and as some have pointed out a few features are missing in the mobile app. but qb is convenient. i can take payments, check accounts, and do basic things while i'm out and about. it's good, and quickbooks online support has been great lately.
almost great. this app would be better if it had a little more functionality. i would love to be able to upload photos to invoices or even send an invoice from the app. i find myself not really using the app very much because it does not have full functionality. it would be nice if qb could mirror their web based app.
. excelente app para llevar las finanzas del negocio.
awesome interface. awesome app. that's what it says it will do. the only problem is when i log an expense it attaches receipts as images and not as pdfs. also i do not like the image scanner it doesn't trim around the edges of the receipt. i end up having to use a pdf scanner and then attach the receipt in quickbooks online in a browser.
not industry standard software. this is a clunky, disappointing, entry level piece of work. qb has been available for many years and i cannot believe that, having been recommended to download by our accountant, it feel like it has barely reached beta testing level. a real pity that microsoft money is no longer supported. that’s how to put a piece of software together. i have littleno confidence in the product.
easy. seems to do everything i need it to.
. account function is good . but technical support & help customer service is poor, not responding. wrost app
great. amazing app but whoever did that last update screw it all up. can save estimate or invoices. horrible. i hope they refund at least a month of fees because i'm loosing money having to do all my estimatesinvoices at my house instead. needs to be fixed asap.
good for on the road. let's me add invoices and expenses while away from the office, works well.
must have. this app is an all around life saver for the on the go business minded person! freedom to work on the go!! absolutely love it!
statements. can't send statements or use bundles in the app. email customer services about it and they send you a email about doing it on your desk top. been asking for 6 months to have it added to the app. just get the same response while they add useless gimmicks to the app.
convenient. qbo is very convenient for checking biz summary on the go. especially if you are traveling and client asking for some info. invoicing is pretty easy too.
great little app, controls most bookkeeping chores saving my time and legal requirements.. just a great app for keeping track of your debtors, creditors and making the calculating of bas and payroll liabilities a breeze.
great app. qbo is a fantastic app for small business. it makes balancing the books easy and less time consuming than the old paper method. it syncs with your business accounts making the job of keeping track of your business accounts easy. you can get a snapshot of your business's finances, balance sheet, p & l from the report tab on the app.
no more ios 8 support. disappointed that app developers are dropping ios8 support. not everyone upgrades the second apple comes out with a new ios
. simple. easy to use. reliable. 5 stars all around.
"rarely works. the quickbooks app worked great for awhile. now with the last update, nothing refreshes. i'm always receiving messages that it can't ""update at this time. try again later."" very disappointing"
. great app to have if you starting your own business, you need to have this app. you can keep track through laptop, tablet and phone. you can make it as simple as you like or as detailed you want to be! awesome!
. i thibk quickbooks hitnthe mark here verybwell nice app not but having a subscription for it all worth it
. makes life easier for thse of us with mathmatical challenges and poor memories.
disappointed. i’ve been using the phone app for a year now. when the app works it is fine however it constantly freezes and my only option is to restart my phone. i have deleted and downloaded the app several times but it has not fixed the issues.
. signed up to app. no clear pricing. my invoice had vat numbers all over it but i'm not vat registered. seems impossible to take vat number off invoices. customer service very slow and hard to get though to. no tel number.
. great app. handy
"convenient. having a small business can be challenging...a customer requested a copy of invoice to be resent from my office.... ""i have no office"".....downloaded d app and baam, job done....awesome!!!!!!"
"about 710. not bad but not good. the app keeps requiring updates if used on apple products. not an issue but the updates never appear. quickbooks blames apple and apple blame quickbooks. we ""updated to the cloud version"" from a pcm based quickbooks. so far we are very very disappointed."
. great app. links with square pay pos. allows me to keep an eye in real time and also makes liaising with my accountant seamless. great value for money and highly recommended.
very good mobile app. i use this on my computer and when i noticed that there was an app for android, i immediately installed it on my tablet and phone. a must have if you have a mobile business or have to give invoices on the go.
worst customer service. i love the idea of the app but it’s too confusing i don’t get a lot of the options and customer service i barely understood anything was no help at all. i just simply needed the app to track incomeexpense and personal pay.
so easy to go work with!!!. as a new business owner this app makes the process of dealing with the administrative side of it easy and convenient!
. does not work
can't log in?. login problems because i used turbotax. it says i already have an account but won't let me log into quickbooks because i don't have an account!?!
. this app doesn't work! such a disappointment to say the least! i'll edit my review once the app is available for use! still not working!
worthless. so cluncky so slow impossible to make an invoice unless you want it to take a half hour to create one.
very good app. good
love it!. we've used qb for about a decade, and looove the new app. makes life easier!!
hard to navigate. hard to navigate
great app. i personally find the app easier then the desktop version. everything is quick and easy to do. raise an invoice or estimate instantly and see your bank account balance. great.
great app. works great for managing customers and invoices for our company!
buggy. try to submit feedback and can’t within the app. they removed the quantity column from invoices and their support is dismissive. this is a big company who price gouges and doesn’t really care about it’s customers.
. no good for basic simple book keeping and way to complicated. why would you trust a group of app developers will your banking details
love it. done right.. finances done right. only quirk is the need to type password fairly regularly, plus only prompted touch id some of the time. apple watch app often wants me to log in on phone first.
used to work. are you ever going to fix the ap
still does not allow entering employee time. the ability to enter employee time is a must for professionals that are on the road all day. other services like freshbooks already have this ability. until intuit makes this very important addition to the mould app, it does not deserve 5 stars!
quickbooks app is a perfect companion to quickbooks online. quickbooks app is a perfect companion to quickbooks online. it works seamlessly allowing you to read through your transactions and even create most of the common tasks. ( with the exception of vat tasks) qb online is the perfect accounts program
signature issues. the app crashes every time i get a signature or it doesn't save the signature. please resolve this issue. it has now been a week and this is still an issue.
dirty tactics for subscription. unsubscribing to this app is so difficult. an error prompt always appears everytime i process unsubscribing. but if it’s any form of purchase, upgrading, downgrading, anything other than unsubscribing works just fine. no reply from their customer service since i contacted them a few weeks ago. i hope other people who has the same problems with this app comes forward so this developer stops milking money from unwilling customers.
. i'm new to the app but so far loving it.
struggle. guys i've been struggling to log in onto this app from my galaxy s6 for several weeks now, i'm considering switching to another provider. please fix this bug. ive tried for hours at a time, everytime it asks me if i am a robot, but it never logs in just hours of saying signign in. the whole point of having this app is being able to do stuff on the go and right now thats not working...
great app!. awesome tool for your business. if you don’t have a background in basic accounting principals, get a bookkeeper to help you set it up. a great chart of accounts will make the reports super useful.
amazing. i haven't seen smart accounting software like this 👍🏼
. easy to invoice clients and get paid fast.
could be better!. need reoccurring billing, invoices need to be more clear after multiple invoices have been sent. it would b a great idea to have some agreement templates.
love this app!. i actually find this easier to use than the desktop version.
email issue. when emailing invoicesestimates with other attachments the quickbooks attachment doesn't go through
the android app is so diffrent than the ios app.. ios app has the functionality to select multiple items too an estimateorder with the multi select feature. this is missing in android. also before the update, the send comand asked the way we wanted to send the invoice and we can select email, fax application. but with the update it only send with the quickbooks email. cant send by fax anymore. please provide the share option on invoice and estimates atleast.
. really slow compared to desktop
just ok. the mobile version is fine. it the desktop version is full of bugs and slow. wastes a lot of my valuable billing time.
great app!. easy to navigate and great to have access with you at all times. love it!
. why can't i see bank account details in the app? you can on the ios app contacted help desk who couldn't help! without access to accounts the app is effectively useless. i have done everything you suggest. home screen is now blank! so even worse than when i started. i have also contacted support with no solution as yet.
. unless you are truly tech savvy avoid this app since finding help was as bad as getting help from fb or instagram in my opinion.
great app. app is great and worked well with my iphone x but just updated to iphone 11 pro mac and app will not open crashes and closes every time please fix
tax ratescounties are incorrect. when i create an invoice from this app, it doesn’t select the correct county even when i manually change it. it causes it to transfer back to desktop version as the wrong county when saved and will not account for that county. please fix
. great app, i am a self employed consultant, i invoice with ach bank transfers for 0.0% free! all accounts synced. good stuff!
user friendly but. this program is extremely user friendly and makes book keeping easy for small business owners but the cost of doing payroll for employees is extremely expensive. i have 5 employees and it costs way to much for me to use quickbooks 👎
. qbo much improved over original launch product, and tge app has brought qbo up.to date. i love the ability to upload receipts tgat immediately sync with qbo and match to vendorsexpenses. qbos ability to have multiple ysrs working simultaneously is huge . realtime collaboration with my bookkeeper and accountant is now easy. no more thirdparty file sharing apps and concerns about version control. with the app i can now monitor financials on the fly. highly recommend!
love it!. makes tracking my business expenses super easy.
mgrm. great app. useful and easy to use.
. i've had nothing but trouble with this app. i've sent numerous error reports made several attempts to contact customer support with no reply.
. works great until about a week ago. now i can't save anything from the app it won't sync basically nothing is working right with the app. i even tried installing it on another android phone and had identical problems. don't bother trying to call customer service they say they have nothing to do with the app and that's it.
best addition for any business on the go!. the free trial was amazing. my favorite part is having the ability to send invoices. while setting up my merchant services, customer support was kind and easy to work with. now it's easier to bill my clients from my phone. i track everything. get the quickbooks app. you won't regret it!
very helpful. i just started my free trial and this is such a great tool for me on the go.
never disappointed. best accounting software available!
favorite app. my favorite app. i use it on a daily biases to send invoices right after i complete a job. makes my life so much less stressful.
"qbo is getting better. after learning qbo and using it for the past 2 years, i can say it is slowly improving as a software. it infuriated me in the beginning. and it still can be cantankerous at times. it is also not as robust as the desktop qbs. but it has slowly gotten better. now i kind of ""get"" qbo and find it useful. please continue to improve it."
. dashboard won't even populate. menu button doesn't work. i can only see recent activity. i can not use the app at all!!!!
ios 13. app crashes before opening! please fix asap!
. the app is unusable and highly inferior to the web interface. when you create an invoice, it always defaults to retail invoice without the facility to change to tax invoice, so i'm forced to use the web interface for invoicing. suppliers activity always shows a blank page so again need web interface to view suppliers balance, expenses etc. can't you people make a decent app ?
this app rocks!.
. doesn't work on my galaxy note 5
confusing. very difficult to use.
quickbooks online app. although i do like quickbooks online, the mobile app version is horrible. i downloaded and logged in and it did give me my balance sheet, but said i had no expenses, i could not find a way to put in a journal entry and other reports showed zeros as well. i deleted it from my ipad and will just use the nonapp version ( which you need google chrome vs safari to work properly not a big deal but a bit odd).
ease of use. being able to utilize the app on mobile has made billing my customers so much easier for my transport company. editing and immediately sending invoices for quick pay is a great option as well. i've been a quickbooks user for 20 years now and will likely not stop anytime soon.
doesn't work. omg i'm so frustrated with this app...now it doesn't work at all on my note 5 i've report the error so many times and no reply
slow books. can’t accept transactions in banking section. sluggish app, end up using the computer more often.
quickbooks mobile app. awesome app that let's me quickly and easily access and review what is happening at my business especially when i am away!
good but it needs a work!. quickbooks online is just brilliant, but on the android app you can't switch between companies only by signing out (unlike windowsmac app it's just a matter of a pull down)
great features. great features but would love if i could do sales receipts (and attach photo) and credit card refunds on the mobile app. everything works great and it's very nice having the option to use the mobile or the desktop.
wonderful app. this is a great way to keep books. thank you.
great piece of kit for small business. i have a small business servicing skis and selling waxes from home, i had to send all my invoices out using a word template, this has streamlined all my admin and accounting processes leaving me more time to work with my customers equipment. highly recommended
quick books. love this app. very easy to use!
. this used to be a great app, i have used it for 4 years but unfortunately it is no longer working... i can no longer login, i keep getting an error saying it can't sync. i hope this gets fixed soon, i run 90% of my business from my phone and having a working phone app is part of the fee we pay for qb online.
. great app, works well with the desktop and online versions. great to have my financial info at my fingertips when i need it.
electrical contracting business. very easy and convenient to use. my accountant can log on to it from her office saving me the time and the trip. i appreciate the phone app especially for unexpected service calls.
super functional..extremely helpful. quick books app is fantastic! makes using my phone for invoicing and estimates very easy! recommend to anyone..... no glitches, no hang ups..... you won't be disappointed!
pretty good. app doesnt have enough functionality though, need to go to the website version all the time
. umhhh love it yar
. game changer. invoicing and tracking expenses just got so easy. it's amazing, and i am only sad i didn't know about it sooner!
reduced feature set. previous version:the feature set of the web based app is not matched. (previous mentioned currency and time records). update: removed a lot of preexisting functionality and did not add any missing functions. much worse than before. cannot find a list of invoices due to a supplier. clicking on a particular supplier brings up only the address particulars.
easy to use. as a small business i find this to be a fabulous experience of accounting software integrated across all my various devices. i feel far more in control of my books than any other format or program i have used before. highly recommend this to any mobile business.
. update has not fixed this issue! why can't i see bank account details in the app? you can on the ios app contacted help desk who couldn't help! without access to accounts the app is effectively useless. i have done everything you suggest. home screen is now blank! so even worse than when i started. i have also contacted support with no solution as yet.
it works ok...but, be warned!!. they state 25 business days for payments to clear to your bank account, truth is it typically takes 510 days and way longer if payments are more than a few thousand dollars. they make you wait on your $ while they snag a chunk of interest on your funds. it’s been almost 12 months and we’ve decided to go back to square for their faster processing.
owner. its great doing my acct on the go, staying current. great mobile app adding more features all the the time!
. problem tried to sync my company data, refresh it. and now the app crashes as it is loading my company invoices. it seems to log in fine. just gets hung up when trying to load. was working great at the end of last year. but now it won't work....please help! i was using the app a lot. just want it to work again. p.s. i am using a galaxy s4 android 4.3 thanks!
quick books app. have been using quick books app for my business for a few months now, and i am very impressed with the package, as it's great value for money. i enjoy being able to use the app on my phone as it offer all the services that i need to be able to quickly raise and send invoices and pull up important info.
absolutely love it! best business accounting app. great mobile online app tool that syncs with your online quickbooks on both mac and pcs. is everything that you could ever want or need for bookkeeping, accounting, invoicing and estimates.
. great accounting program thanks!
works 80% of the time.. otherwise does make running a mobile business a lot easier.
please fix!!. i have used this app for the last few years for my business and have loved it. this latest update has made the app virtually unusable. it won't let me save an invoice, doesn't show payments made, makes me sign in every time even though i have a pin and the list goes on. very disappointed and hoping this is fixed soon.
very disappointed. ever since i updated it doesn't save my expenses and crashes a lot. very disappointed.
cool app. i would have given it 5 stars, but it just doesn't have the power that i'm used to with the real quickbooks, but it's ease of use and functionality is still great for a new app.
really good app. still need some more features like invoice customization
. good app for accounting
. i have been using this app for years to run my small construction company. i have never had major issues.
. great app
. works very well for how i use the app within my business.
. good app very good addition to qb online really convenient. no issues or problems so far and seems quite secure. simple to use
loads of bugs since updating to ios 13. broken links. can’t call up customer information. dashboard only shows banking information. invoices and estimates haven’t saved when generated on mobile device.
can’t bill my time from mobile. overall it’s a good app. my only complaint is that i can’t report my billable time using the apps. they have a nice integration on qb online with google calendar, it would be nice if they also add that to the mobile app. at minimum you should be able to report time to a project in the mobile app.
. convenient app. helps me keep up with my accounts.
continuing issues. i've had the online and app for over a year and a half but the last 6 months it's a pain. double entries and trouble meshin with my bank for 2.5 months. ugh frustrating
really!!. i have business to run. fix it !!
awesome app. awesome app and online as well. runs rings around xero. app is 100x better
. does a good job. thanks
". error message that cannot be fix ""cannot add this invoice, if error continues, please contact support"" that cannot be fix from quickbooks my android app been like this close to 1 month cannot create invoices estimates so on my business suffer cause of that, have use regular computer to create what was said. not good for business all subscriptions are active."
. how does this app can help the people in the mlm business ? ( ex: amway , avon and tuperware )
. thanks for not overcharging me. not bad it's good app for accounting.
fantastic features. all the features that works under this single app. i used to work with excel spreadsheet, invoice app, expense app to complete the business on the go. now everything has being simplify into this one subscription saving me time and double entry. i am absolutely happy that i can email invoice, take pictures and enter expense using my iphone. best of all these is update into the cloud. great excellent accounting software nothing comes close after trying others accounting software.
accept button doesn’t work.. love the app however this latest update the accept button doesn’t seem to work so you can’t accept the new line items from your bank feed.
. good app at new start...
great but needs improvement. app is really great other then one key thing missing. i need access to employees and doing payruns while on the go and be able to enter in employees hours for casuals with ease.
. excellent app
good and convenient. i can sync quickbooks on my computer, ipad and iphone. convenient
. takes awhile for the accurate data to load. you have to refresh a few times. does not pull up anything when selecting any kind of activity on a customers account.
not great. there are multiple problems wrong with this program. you can't bill a customer when you attach a receipt which means i constantly have to switch between devices. my expenses according to the customer are incorrect. i'd like to see my estimateinvoice minus my expenses per job. the only reason i switched to this program from freshbooks, which is way less expensive and more user friendly is because quickbooks has a balance sheet, which our accountant required.
. i love it on my phone . but on my tablet it's slow and says non responsive a lot.
great app. accounting on the go!. ahh my favorite part of the day just got a whole lot easier. this app lets you track you individual transactions on the fly. it also lets you categorize and itemize expenses. if you like neat books and your on your phone a lot this app makes things easy. it's free so just try it out.
only for ar. this app pretty much just acts as a payments rec'd recorder. has no other functionality that i can see. need to enter vendor invoices on the go so it would be nice if , even if it doesn't have full functionality, you could at least handle vendors and customers on the go.
demoted from 5 stars to 4. using the app on ipad and iphone for more than 5 years. dashboard has been unable to properly show invoice status for at least 3 months now. version 17.9, at least 3 updates ago? no fix yet nor response from intuit after feedback. while i’m not fond of frequent updates, one expects to have these kinds of obvious bugs fixed in the next update.
app needs major work. the app is useless, i have to pull out my laptop or wait till i get to my home or office. i would love to use my ipad pro, that i carry everywhere but the app is literally useless!!! please fix asap
"ireland. works well in ireland but some difficulties with irish vat which for small businesses operate on ""receipts basis"" for vat. but work arounds available.. reporting is great. emailing invoice is so easy. this is cloud accounting at the best and improving all the time. david fields in dublin ireland"
prettt good. it’s a good app, i’d have given it 5 stars but the sequential number doesn’t load when using the app. this means to produce an invoice you have to go back and look up the last invoice number.
need o and p. really need to add a way for someone to mark up of the invoice and show change orders to estimates.
. this app requires a password even though i chose google login. if i need a password anyway, what's the point of a google login?! quickbooks online doesn't require it. disappointed and uninstalling. i have enough accounts as it is.
convenient & helpful. as a new business owner and usually overwhelmed with just running the business, the app and website make the financial and tax side of the business easy to stay current and accurate. once i got the initial tax required and payroll payments set up, it's made my life easier.
slow to respond from time to time .. the app is sometimes slow to respond.
liking it more and more. was able to set it up to do sale receipts on all devices. keep finding more and more to do with the app. would like to see reports on mobile devices.
great app. i’ve been using this app for about a week now so far it’s been great.
work in progress, work not yet completed. very convenient and functional tomorrow to add expenses and receipts on the go. however only expenses not bills or other random transactions can be accessed through the mobile app. hoping intuit sees the feedback and that all transactions available including bills to be accessed on the mobile app.
great. amazing app but whoever did that last update screw it all up. can save estimate or invoices. horrible. i hope they refund at least a month of fees because i'm loosing money having to do all my estimatesinvoices at my house instead. needs to be fixed asap.
great for small business. i am a partner in a small mobile based business and the financial dealings are my responsibility. quick books online along with the app make everything so much easier than what we were previously using. using the app is pretty intuitive and you can accomplish anything i need to at a job site.
. very good program
some good some bad. have had several issues. mostly the program is easy to learn, use and navigate. the issues i have had are not easily resolved. they take time to fix and information for fix are not easily navigated. i do feel that it is safe to use.
. very easy to navigate!
qb app. not useful as it could be as you can't enter a bill! not being able to enter a bill makes it useless to work from an ipad or tablet device.
broken update. your update broke the app.
shiny, pretty and useless. the shinier they make it, the more confusing and unfriendly it gets. no reminders, no scheduled transactions and no searchable help. i have the ipad app to make accounting quick and easy when i travel not to have something new to learn.
great app. this app helps tremendously! great work and thank you for making book keeping so simple.
great app. easy to use
ios 13 problems. quickbooks is normally pretty good, the online version is fantastic. unfortunately the app no longer works on ios13, i will come back once the app has been updated and revise my review.
inexplicably no timesheet support in app. the most obviously missing feature is time sheet support. the support team is also quite useless and closes cases without resolving them or providing any assistance.
. such an amazing app for storing all your business expenses.it's very convenient and easy to use.those who have difficulty in managing their business transactions should definitely go for this app.
. will not let me create and save new transactions with htc one. please fix this issue. using mobile browser is very frustrating.
great business app. i truly do not know where my business would be without this app.
keeps getting better. interface much improved and good to have access to bank transactions.
crashing non stop. keeps crashing when trying to sign in, couldn't even use trial, useless crap, trial expired, done the usual uninstallreinstall, still didn't work
. love the flexibility of using the app in keeping the business running.
. easy to use and navigate. makes business life so much easier
. great program, and getting better all the time.
so far so good!. easy to use, quick, simple. like it so far...
great app. quickbooks online works really well, fits my needs as an independent consultant. the mobile app is great for keeping me current on the fly.
. love this app. hardly have to get on my computer
horrible. it’s true the only reason i will install qb on my phone is to record expense on the fly,and it doesn’t do it
. its a good app but they keep raising the monthly charge by more than 25% every 10 months... i'm no paying $35month. i will be looking for a new accounting software.
missing functions. great app for its current functions but it is missing functions such as entering bills while on the road. most of my purchases are on accounts so it leaves me doing my book work at home like the old systems. if this gets added i will stay a happy user if not back to one of the other competitors.
. easy to use and navigate
pretty good but no international customers?. the vendors that are set up as eu or other don't show up on interface, a problem when half your business is international. also, entering invoices is cumbersome, only use for extreme circumstances. but nice to have something that partially functions when on the run.
instant customer service 👌. great app for small to mid size business. phenomenal integration from windows 10. so far so good. thanks.
rubbish. doesn't work. need to add bills but can't. how ridiculous to not have this function. deleted. no support from customer service
poorest customer service i’ve ever experienced. wow quickbooks has done it again making key changes without customer notification changes leave me hanging with no ability to do business then phone calls to customer service are long waits. must be effecting a whole lot of customers just a simple email or cs agent phone call might help. but the changes for worse again. seriously poorest service ever!!
quickbooks. absolutely great piece of software making my business so much easier to run.
fix finally now i can get back to work.. this version fixed the errors from the last update. glad it working again. quickbooks has been good except the last update. this one fixed the issue. we us this app for our onsite business and it's great. several times i would send an invoice to the customer when i'm leaving their home and before i get to the next job it's already paid.
. best app
. i got this to sync with my online account and it doesn't. also it won't let me add a sales tax. and so what's the point if i hafta enter everything into separate accounts.
. great app, makes accounting easy!
. sucks. terrible app
. why does it keep saying that there is technical difficulties in using the app? even before prior update, it had this issue. no issue with the ios app though
great and very useful. don't leave home without it
useless. invoices won't save please fix
. often doesn't work. customer service tells me not to use the app, to access account from web browser. the numbers you get there may be undependable. don't trust it.
great app. loving it  i love keeping track of expenses on the go and how it syncs with quickbooks online.
simple to use. easy to use and cuts out all the paperwork and spreadsheets
quickbooks is quirky. i am not a fan because they just don't embrace mac users. the app is not reliably working.
excellent solution. moved from qb desktop longtime user 9+ years this app and the online approach work really well.
. so how long is your app going to be temporarily unavailable? we're going on 3 days now and i need to bill people.
horrible accounting program. barely an accounting program. one would think qb would create an online version mirroring their desktop software. navigating the online software is a headache, let alone using it for basic accounting purposes. of course qb ever improving their software is as likely to happen as me winning the lottery.
. halimuzzaman syed. islami bank ltd bangladesh.
"great app. android sg5 needs (negative) """" option when editing the amount entry on invoices."
brilliant. i'm not great with keeping up with book work but this app makes it so easy that i actually want to put the time in and do it properly. a must have for small business
excellent software. best products, excellent customer service, can't imagine how i would manage without it. thanks quickbooks!!!
. excellent app, love it.
. i love the app! there are a few updates i'd like to see on the estimates and order entry fields but it's still saves so much time. it really has changed the way i do business. great app and program.
useless for sure. qbo is useless. can’t login with google account. forces me to create a newseparate password. can’t really access qbo via a browser on ipad. overall terrible experience. i’m sure it’s equally apple and qbo fault.
. after upgrading to lg g6 the app no longer works. can't even get it to load. reinstalled, rebooted still nothing.
excellent app. superb app living my life by it now couldn't recommend enough
"app now totally dead, cannot login at all.. can't login anymore, giving a weird ""suspicious activity detected"" error and refuses to login, running android 5.0. works fine on my pc, osx laptops and ios devices. this is a known problem on android. see this https:community.intuit.comquestions1281477cannotloginmobileapp. still can't create purchase orders on android or ios! that's almost a deal breaker for me. i can search for items while creating invoicesestimates in android  but not ios?"
. love this app. makes tax time so much easier. couldn't be much happier.
qb online is awesome. i was using qb the software was yrs. i changed over to online do to ease of everything. it's great everything syncs up after easy setup. love it
absolutely stunning app. best of all the time n useful too
switching between account requires logout and login. so annoying, especially since there is no support for touch id. why can't you let us switch from within the app?
. great app. makes paperwork a lot easier.
. i'm getting sick of this app real fast it comes tr manly crashes i try calling the 1800 number and nothing
. exceptional experience and great customer service.
. keeps my accountant happy 😇
. used to work perfect ever since update it's very unreliable. can't log into app reliably. it often locks me out right when i'm standing in a customer's house trying to invoice them or locks me out when i need to go through my client list for a phone number etc. i suggest you consider competitors software until the app becomes stable again.
update breaks layout in iphone xr. latest update breaks the invoices page layout. long client names force the amount column into a single space column. now the amounts show like this. $1 2 3 4 instead if this $1234
crashes. every time i try signing in the app says my sign in has expired.
disappointed. this app falls short. for one you can't see inventory. can't create po. can't enter a bill against a po. on the online version one cannot enter a partial bill against a po. cannot creat inventory level alarms. come on man!
. why doesn't this app work at all on my samsung?? its saying it can't be supported.
very useful!. great functionality!
i can't run a business with quick books. the format is different on my ipad that it is on my iphone. i don't have the ability to do half the stuff i can do from my computer, which is a huge inconvenience when i'm in the field. i wouldn't recommend quickbooks or the apps to anybody.
. really helps me track my buisness expenses
". takes customer support weeks to respond, and even then, they have no idea what causes the many errors. be prepared to find work around and give up on certain functions. regret the decision to work with qbo. unable to sync with my data through app, after 3 days of ""engineers working on it"" (or are they off on the weekend even though your problem started onba friday?)"
great app. first time running a business and this is everything i need i love it
great but needs some updates. just recently i am unable to log in to my company. i can get on to my online account, but not on the app?? says my email and password isn’t found?
to glitchy. way to many glitches but worst of all it is supposed to be exactly the same on the deferent computers and some times the same invoices show up on one computer and not on my i pad and only sometimes on my i phone 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
. fast and simple to use.
couldn't perform like we do without. great app!!!! highly recommended. tracks and categories everything with moderate input from you. great on tax day!
. this app has never worked on my phone. it gives me the login screen, i enter my password, and the app force closes.
getting better. they've agressively added functionality over the past year...becoming a more complete app!
owner eleganttouchlimos llc. the best off best. quick book i ben used last 4 years the make my busnise everything easy. invoice custumer and recipts i like it thank you so much. good job
great for my small business!. all my invoices, sales receipts and estimates right at my finger tips. no need to wait until i have computer access. saves tons of time and i can get paid much quicker!
roofing company. the app is great, although it needs an update with bugs fixed. the app won't allow me to modify, save or send invoices. very frustrating.
. great app
. thank you for the update guys 😊 perfect accounting app for my firm
. does what i need when i don't have computer access.
. this app works really good makes owning a service business simple. love that i can get done at a customers house and send an invoice
loved it. its very useful app to track expenses and invoice.
i can’t do payroll from the app. it works great and is much improved from the original versions but i do not have a desktoplaptop pc........ only ipads and android phones and the apps limits my access way to much i currently use the chrome browser but it’s horrible only part of the screen is visible on the ipad some save buttons can not be accessed thanks for your help
i love quickbooks online. i love quickbooks online & my accountant does also. this app is really good for doing your expenses on but as far as invoicing i still do it on the computer. it's very handy for a small business. the fact you can enter an expense, take a picture of the receipt & go on your merry way. i'm sold.
. small business owner. this app is terrible, do not not rely on it. does not work well on android devices, no matter how many times the browser is reset along with strong data connection.
. horrible, spent 2 hours trying to cancel subscription. they don't have the cancel button. called them...45 min wait. terrible service.
great app. overall its a great app. you can do many things from the app that you can do on the desktop version. i would like to be able to enter the worked hours on the app and also to be able register vendor invoices not only expenses.
major flaw. the app ui is pretty good and i really like the interface. the problem is that a lot of my invoices are not even viewable on the app. basically anything that has a delayed charge on it won't show up so there is a major glitch there or something.
not good after update. used to send invoices via email through my phone android before update cannot anymore. called customer service told me to uninstall and reinstall still same problem.. had to buy an ipad in able to send invoices :( horrible!
richard. great app, great product.
. really like being able to send invoices and estimates out in the field.
good but can be better. like that i can update bank info. does double entry sometimes.
just started. i just started my business and only had a few transactions. when i downloaded qb online it was simple and everything reconciled perfectly. it's easier then the old software too which i am use to using.
. there are many bugs and glitches. the ios version allows bank feed updates and this one doesn't!! still doesn't. still buggy.
great app! very easy to understand and use!. great app! very easy to understand and use! david lorea farrington
best for small businesses on the go. i'm a cpa consultant that specializes in accounting systems and qb and its other products qbo are the most popular in our vancouver market. it's popular simple to use, has good built in reporting, and lots of apps. and it's adaptable for virtually all small businesses.
update is horrible!. i've been using qb online app for a long time. and it seem like the app finally had started to improve and now this latest update has caused some great frustration. i do not recommend updating totally get these glitches resolved.
best app. will recommend for everyone
. good this is a pretty good program. it would be better if you could create purchase orders and make deposits.
fantastic app for a superb product!!. i've been using quickbooks since i began my private voice and piano studio. i am able to easily track invoices and payments and send reminders to my students and their parents. the app has helped me save time when adding payments so i can focus my time on my students. i also love how i can send receipts and reminder invoices even when i am on the run! definitely a 5 star product & app!
slow and buggy. disappointed in app. doesn't correlate well with desktop version. slow to load information and sometimes won't update accounts.
not working properly after update. i just updated the app and now every time i try to edit an invoice it forces me to refresh the invoice and i lose my changes. the pin number does't work, i added it again and made sure it is turned on, but i have to sign in with my username and password each time. it worked perfectly on the last update.
. love the app, have used it for years. just wish by now they would add biometric log in.
useless. won't accept my phone number so can't go any further ill look elsewhere for a app that works
i can't run a business with quick books. the format is different on my ipad that it is on my iphone. i don't have the ability to do half the stuff i can do from my computer, which is a huge inconvenience when i'm in the field. i wouldn't recommend quickbooks or the apps to anybody.
best app for business. let's me do all my work on the go
needs some improvements. great app only thing that would make it better is an offline version for the ipad
a good idea but not very useful yet. there is not access to the important online reports. there is no access to fx transactions or accounts in a foreign currency. i live overseas and bill my clients in us dollars and as such have no access to client information or us dollars sales and accounts. if the app mirrored the online program it would be great but it doesnt!!
great app if it worked.. this app was really promising at first, but now it seems like i consistently have issues with chase bank accounts and american express accounts updating. it’s monday and sine thursday my alchase accounts say they are updated when they are not and my amex continuously has error connections. and then u call customer service and they ask you if you called amex to see why there was a connection problem. a shame.
. i can't login my account
. being mainly a cis contractor it won't let me make invoices in app so have to use browser which doesn't work so have to wait till i get home to invoice from laptop. any chance of this being resolved. please note i have tried multiple phones and it is near impossible on mobile browser. trying to keep keyboard up is a nightmare.
missing one major feature of a mobile app: time tracking!. a deal breaker for me, you can't track time while on the move! the rest seems good but without this feature there is no point in me evaluating it any further :(
great app. works great for invoicing or estimating on the go. 5 stars if it was completely synced to my laptop. sometimes i don't see estimates that were done in the office available to seeedit on the mobile app.
don't support in india. if you don't support in india why you create account in first place.
works great. this app works perfect for recording our small farms purchases and sales. it is very easy and convenient to use.
crashes, not usable, nexus 5x. crashes and no longer usable on a stock nexus 5x on android 6.0.1. app is now useless to me on my phone which is a major problem.
. this app is easy to use and keep on top of, all business activites are in one place and the calculations are done for you!
very nice!. i love have this power in my phone! i can email invoices or print them out, all on my phone! this app is easy to learn and soooooo fast when you get used to it. there was a lot of thinking when they designed this app, wow
excelente app. helpful tool
great app. been with quickbooks for two years now and still really impressed very easy to use and works across all platforms would strongly recommend
still needs work. not all features are equally accessible on pc, ipad or iphone, such as selecting different estimate and invoicing templates. most likely a bug and would love to see that fixed . the online version on the pc is slowwww
. useless app. can't integrate one of the biggest bank of australia (cba) with this app. support is just forwarding issue from one team to other. wated almost one hour on the phone. solution is to forward the issue to next level. there are three companies under my account with same name. cannot delete company. how app allow to create three identical names?? wast of time and money.
great app but one major flaw. overall this is a fantastic app that allows me to keep up on my books. there is one thing that is extremely annoying though.. the camera and auto crop feature is terrible! please don't assume my images need to be cropped because the tool cuts off the image most of the time. maybe make this optional?
how can a customer approve an estimate??. why do you have the electronic signature function available for the ipad and not android?? it defeats the purpose of having a tablet on the job site. i may as well stick with my 3 part form.
quick books makes my life easier!. doing estimates and sending invoices is easier then ever!
does everything i need.. if i could see my outstanding bills on the dashboard, i would say it was perfect. but even though qb have chosen not to include this requested feature, i am still happy to recommend.
almost perfect. it would be perfect if there was an overview dashboard that showed outstanding invoices like the online dashboard.
great mobile app. allows me to take my business anywhere.
needs work. it's better than before but still doesn't download recent transactions with the ap. must log in on the computer to keep updated. why is that? needs attention.
management. good online on the go, but it has too many breakdowns, constantly has crashes, and makes it frustrating when you needed, if there were another online app that i will use i probably would consider on changing, for something simple is probably the right one for many customer that used the app.
good app. excellent
. still somewhat confusing.
. very slow and not convenient as current fast trend requirements....it's waste of money..i really suggest for zoho..very good..very fast ....best service and users convenient... still after your review, i'll suggest for zoho because of there are many function which is available on handly face which is many time i was given suggestion to quick books team but there was nothing improvement and after waiting so much time, i'll go for zoho which is too much easy to made my business. not given refund
app is changed for the worse. i am not sure when this happened, but the app is now useless and does not have the functionality it used to have. i now need to do everything on computer. not good.
good app. it does ok in a pinch. certainly easier to search transactions on a computer.
. auto mileage tracker not working despite being set to do so. need to add starting and ending mileage and let the app calculate distance.
awesome, powerful app. we've been using quickbooks for years, this app allows us to take all our bookkeeping at our finger tips
hong leong connect first. i don’t get to link to my leong connect first account. please fix this so that i use it right away. my sister told me this app is superb.
love it. so easy and convenient to use !
. good accounting sofware, horrible on intuitively usage. just try and make an estimate or invoice online with an android tablet or phone and you will experience what i am talking about, it is very lacking the ease of usage, also lacking on choices when you select services, clients, and want to make a quarry forget about it! for accounting it works but, to simple for customer management.
. when it works it works great. however i have to periodically delete and reinstall the app because it gets buggy entering new expenses. it will get locked in the expense screen. in the locked screen if i hit save 5 times it will record the transaction 5 times while still sitting in the entry screen.
good, but could be great!. it doesn't allow you to giveoffer a customer discount (% off the customers bill). it also doesn't transfer the customer notes from estimates to the final invoice. we have to copy & paste or write the description all over again. otherwise, it's pretty user friendly.
crashes every time i try to open anything.. i hate this app.
crashes on iphone x. crashing on iphone x
. great app!!!
excellent tool. the industry benchmark. does exactly what i need  and on the fly too!
. sending invoices from my phone is super easy and i love it.
. love the ease of use for this app.
. tried twice now to add my bank account and no luck, keeps saying i'm logged in on another device but i'm not. been into online support twice now and they can't fix it so the app is pointless to me
"quick books is the bombdiggity!! ya heard!. as a small business owner it saves me time, click, picture of the receipt, click and the expense is logged in real live time. no more saving piles and piles of receipts. it also pin point tracks your expenditures. it's the ""bombdiggity""!"
no date field in invoice line items?. i have asked many times and still haven't seen a date field in the invoice line items. you have it on the online version but can't access it from these applications so these applications are basically freaking worthless to me!
major flaw  can't run payroll or attached from dropbox. 3 stars as you are unable to run payrol on the go or even view payroll  employees wages which is a major part of this app that is missing. also when uploading attachments you can attached anything other than a photo. no links to dropbox etc which again is a major flaw
lacking compared to ios version. the layout and functionality compared to the ipad version is horrible and hard to use. plus there is no way for the customer to sign for invoice or estimate on tablet or phone. i am an android fan all the way, but i am going to have to purchase an ipad to get the functionality i need. i am very disappointed.
taking our business to a new level. we have been so happy since we switched to quickbooks online plus! it has allowed us to streamline our invoicing and bookkeeping. our clients love how easy it is to pay invoices online. we love knowing we've received payment for each cleaning performed! qb customer service is excellent.
. reasonable app, i don't ask much of it to be honest but being able to invoice onsite is nice. the feature for photographing receipts is pointless as you still have to enter all of the information anyhow, and it would be nice to be able to send a customer a statement from the app while i'm stood in front of them. i don't use the receive online payment option so i can't comment.
. makes my job sooooo,much easier
save so much time. love this app. now i can review customer history in the field, and even get some of my bookkeeping done wherever i am. its fast, has options i need, and fits in my pocket.
basic functionality. just signed up for quickbooks online. the android app installed fine on my new samsung tablet. no issues running and using app. however, the app is minimal functionality. there is also no good dashboards like the pc or online web version of the program. pretty disappointed being development of such features is not complicated nor expensive for a home dashboard.
love it. love this app. makes business so easy!
perfect business program. only thing missing is purchase order creation
bad update. i was having trouble with the mileage tracker and now with the update i can’t even check the settings. please fix this. i am paying for this service to help run my business. this isn’t a free game app.
too many problems entering expenses. he expenses are not taking the payee. i had to switch to desktop to enter the expenses with the payee. hopefully quickbooks will address it.
reports needed. need simple reports such as sales tally for a given day. unnecessary steps required for multiple entries, should use 'save and next.'
great app!!. this app helps me stay connected to my office while being out on jobsites. i can check customer invoices from previous jobs to see what process was done. great app.
awesome app. this is a brilliant app. i have all my invoices and expenses at my fingertips. very easy to use and synchs perfectly with qbo on my mac. keeps me on track with daily reminders of overdue invoices. no one gets away with not paying me now.
quickbook app. quick and easy
i like the app but having issues. the app is good when it works however for several i have had issues with the app not opening. not sure what is causing it
. does not work in india. restarts the phone . takes too long to uninstall
replacing invoice2go after 7years. excellent software
fantastic qb's app. this app is great! works just as good, if not better, as the desktop version. to me it seems even more user friendly & it is just so convenient when on the go. definitely download! it works so well, i decided to pay the monthly fee to use it.
. office on the go! i run a tree service so i'm never in the office. this app let's me take care of businesses while in the field and frees up time when i get home at night.
perfect!!!. this software is perfect!!!!
if only i could run payroll. the only thing the app is missing is the ability to run payroll from the app. if it had payroll it would be a 5 star app rating.
awesome app. it's a womderful app, so versatile and functional
. its pathetic. downloaded it and got it all started and when i try to connect my bank it tells me i have an internet connection problem when i'm on a super awesome lte connection. reinstalled it with no change. talk about trust issues before we even get started.
great program. i love the program and still give it 5 stars nonlinear issue is i can’t run credit cards on the ipad version. wish it worked.
". we really like quickbooks online. it works nice but, the android phone and apple ipad apps still need some work. while functional in some things, overall app needs improved. we still use it, only when absolutely necessary, not a go to thing. my rating will change to 10 stars when  ""if"" they update these apps. but qb in general, love it!"
. great ape i like it i can manage my customers from anywhere,good ape
. very nice.
unable to login via iphoneipad. every time i try and login from my iphone or ipad it tells me no account associated with the given information. but when i login via a web browser with the exact same information i have no problem. basically defeating the purpose of the app. fix asap please
quickbooks fanatic. loving using quickbooks for my diesel mechanic business keeps all my files invoices in order... highly recommend this application gotta love it
quickbooks online. great app. saves having to cart round invoice pads.
. loving quickbooks! so easy doing invoices and tracking payments etc. would recommend this to any business owner.
. works great to create sales receipts in the go and accept transactions into the register. have to do deposits on a computer. but love qbo for being able to use on all platforms.
good app poor customer service. was trying to switch over my account settings and the representative i had helping me seemed very lost and wasn’t of any help. still confused on how to swap my account to a different package and receive refunds on duplicate charges. really quite frustrated. besides that the app itself provides the services i need.
review this, quickbooks. i was using the app on my ipad, and kept getting a notice to ‘submit a review’. only choice was ‘ not now ‘ . after every transaction, after every page change, the message came up to ‘submit a review’ i pay a monthly subscription, stop bugging me. here’s your review.
. haven't been able to access my books since early september, can only use desktop app, browser and mobile app gives error message. contacted support 4+, engineers are working on known problem...10 weeks and counting
poor. the program is slow and it is hard to find what you want. does not compare to their desktop version.
great app when it works.... after update to ios 13 as well as the latest version of the qbo app, i cannot access supplier information. on top of that, i am unable to save expenses that i am trying to enter too. there goes the productivity. qbo team really need to be better at this!
makes life easy. great app that makes accounting on the fly so simple.
keep crashing. after last update june 12 2019 keep crashing. new update came just an hour ago still same crash???!!!doesn’t launch the app. please fix asap pleasseeee
should have been ready for io13. i waited patiently while running the io13 beta & this app not working. but now that the official io13 public release is available i have to give this 1 star, 0 if i could. the app just crashes!! quickbooks, you should have had your app ready way before this public release.
. so watered down it's basically useless. better off waiting until you get to a computer if you're actually trying to accomplish anything.
good unless u need their help. i had a problem as accidentally created 2 companies in the one profile. subscription applied to wrong company and they had no idea how to fix it. the company with all my accounting was cancelled as ‘trial ended’ but other company with no data was fully subscribed. very frustrating when dealing with idiots in the phone!
. incredibly hard to unsubscribe, i have been paying for this app and do not need it after 2 years. i still cannot find the unsubscribe part on google play and have followed the useless instructions to do so. not happy.
fits my needs. easy app, portable. thank you
". would give 5 stars if i could put a message on an invoice or estimate; like ""work location"""
. just unistalled and reinstalled the app hopefully it is going to work. after doing over 70 invoices it stopped working dashboard showed blank 😕
great app. just started my own business and having quick books is a lifesaver. easily customized and user friendly. the app saves time since i can maintain my books on the go and my cpa sees the same thing instantly. great app for a service business
. simple and easy to use
absolutely terrible!!!!!. this app is garbage. funny that intuit is in their name because there is nothing intuitive about anything in this app at all. complete waste of time!!! complete garbage. just trying to set up the basic information about accounts that i use and tailor the app to my needs was excruciating. i can’t say enough about how bad this is!!!!!!
easy to use. excellent app. very straight forward to use. the only issue i have is not been able to raise purchase orders on the app. this is very important to me because of the nature of my business, other than that it's spot on.
great app. works well recommend for chippys like myself :)
useful app. simplified accounting package.
won’t interface to bank any more. after several months since my bank kicked qb out of accessing my bank account for reconciling, the problem still remains. accessing my bank account and reconciling all transactions over my iphone was my number one reason to use qb. still disappointed. i have to pay a bookkeeper to do my books with qb now. why can xero have bank access but qb can’t sort itself out after several months !
. very easy to use with my mobile business. i can instantly manage my finances and customer service. awesome app!
. great app! easy to use.
. good apps
slow at the app not compatible with ipad. something wrong with this app , slowly uploading and not easily manageable on the ipad
don’t update to ios 13 if you want this to work. there a so many bugs with this app now that ios version 13 has been released. you can’t even enter an expense now without an error popping up that you need to create a template. quickbooks online support has been no help. they advised i use the browser on my phone. what’s the point of the app then? test test test folks.
so. slow.. this app functions ok, i guess but it runs so slow! taking a receipt picture to enter an expense, for example, should be a quick and easy fast but the app moves so slow and it takes too many taps to complete such a simple task.
worse than useless. i downloaded this app as use quickbooks daily, the pc software is great! the apple app is such a waste of time, i can’t access any reports and the info it does show me is a waste of my time just a load of numbers that don’t mean anything. no thought has gone into this app i suspect it’s just a tick box exercise creating an app...
. terrible. my bank account will not sync and support refuse to contact me. no transactions show up other than the ones that appeared the first time i downloaded this app. definitely not worth paying for the full version.
. good app
beyond useless. i have long been frustrated by intuit's decision to bar users on ipads from accessing any real functionality in quickbooks. i thought this app might address that problem, but it does not. it does not offer anything useful to me.
. this app doesn't allow me to sign in, so it's been useless.
drat! not even close. this has no more functionality than the mobile ap, very disappointing! access to the banking tab & registers to make and receive payments, along with access to the entire vendor tab & reporting would be helpful. i am not sure why intuit focused its efforts on creating an app that imports images & info from social networking sites intead of focusing on making better functionality of what it actually takes to run a business.
. does all that i need for my lawn and landscape company.
. great app. works for everything i need. had a few issues but they were resolved.
quick oops for android.. cool app. it would be better if it operated like the desktop version..
. issue with app was directed in app to call quickbooks online customer service. no solution after being on the phone for 2 hours, they ended up calling android and at&t to try and fix the issue, which made absolutely no sense to me and got us nowhere. customer service has no clue about anything app related including when the password reset does not send verification code. i ended up having a different company to resolve the issue for me. below instructions solved nothing.
. i've tyred everything!! deleted re download log in log out tryed it on anthoer phone i've rung your company up i've taken out a case and nothing has been done it's under investigation been like 4 days now!!
please make it work with desk top. great app wish it worked with the desk top version
. its pretty good, but the scroll bar on the side of the expenses list is driving me absolutely insane because i keep accidentally scrolling and jumping through the list
mostly simple app. mostly simple app. only issue is posting payments to invoice within app but online no problem.
great app for your business. very easy to use. i love the p&l feature and how everything syncs together. really nice app. no complaints
the option yo use qbo doea not work for ages. the option to use google maps for location misdirects you to install google maps even if it is already installed. this issue had been there since ages and they don't fix it. that's why rated bad. google maps is a must for me. apple maps suck but the app leaves you helpless with apple maps.
latest update issue. the latest update does not allow you to create a sales receipt, estimate, invoice, etc., from the customer, you need to go to the home screen to work around it. this is better than the last time this happened (within the last several months) at which point there was no work around. at least we can process cards for now...
beware the wifi!. after a recent update the invoicing does not work over wifi. forced to do invoices over my iphone on the network. fix it!!!!
. brilliant app, very easy to use even for beginners. also has great customer support for your problems and queries.
works well for me. i am the only employee of my corporation so my books are pretty simple. i have been using the desktop version for years. i switched to this so i could take pictures of my receipts on the go and have them attached to my books. generally, i'm happy with the online version. makes doing my taxes a breeze.
. very hard to do on phone
mr. great app for when i'm running around out of the office.
. very happy with this program an app hats off to u for such an awesome buisness solution
mr. doesn't work on ipad pro or iphone. it says my subscription has expired. i have had it for several years and it still works on macbook but on ios it thinks i am on a free trial until 13th april but still locks me out saying i need to update my subscription. it is useless to me if it won,t work on ipad because i photograph all my receipts into the app. will cancel subscription if it doesn't work soon.
. i've been using this for my business for 5 years. i love it because i csn do it on my phone through the app and desktop! it is also easy to collect and sibmitt all my tax info at tax time. works for me, easy to learn, and reliable.
update google signin never works. update: quickbooks support contacted me. i uninstalled and reinstalled the app and it works now.  i have tried and tried to get into the quickbooks app using the google signin. i get it to work maybe 1 out of every 50 times i try to login. i don't know why they haven't fixed this issue yet. i always end up logging in on my mobile browser instead. fail
. it's good app , little bit negative about the help desk of qb , i had requested lots of time for some query but noboday can answer.
. perfect app
best accounting app. easy to understand & learn
. good and easy to use great app
. quickbooks online has been an invaluable management tool for my small business. i give professional estimates for services & am able to create invoices, receive payment, & track income, expenses, etc.
excellent. love this app!!
great app. great app saves time works well recommend for chippys like myself :)
. brilliant app, very easy to use even for beginners. also has great customer support for your problems and queries.
quickbooks. quickbooks has been absolutely amazing overall. main issue is customer service and their ability to provide customer support for the app. i was required to ph 3 different numbers, one being out of service. once i finally spoke to csr he was extremely friendly but did state they haven’t been provided proper training to assist with app related issues but would do his best to help. i would upgrade to 4 or 5 stars if they provide a user friendly option for support.
. it seems like every time the app updates it turns off automatic mialage tracking. what a pain. then i have to review my calendar and recreate mialage and likely to miss some.
mrs. love quickbooks and this app is sooo easy to use and love it!
. used it for a while. but went back to desktop premier. for the constructionrenovation business it didn't support job costing, change orders or progress invoicing.
ios 11 not ready? lot of bugs and crashes. every time i’m make a new invoice it crashes and take a lot to load and open, still missing two things, send invoices by text message and option to choice your start screen menu
angela. i had quick books in the past when i ran a shoe store and it was wonderful. my problem today is i'm starting a night club and the app has been installing for an hour with no response could you please assist me i'm down loading it on my android phone. it's very important that i hear from you because this system was wonderful.
create a project under a customer for ios. this needs to be added asap. we are a mobile company and would very much utilize creating a project on the go in ios. both for ipad and iphone. thanks.
. nice but needs more. as a bookkeeper, i love quickbooks online because you can access it from anywhere. i like this app but wish i could deposit my payments and see my register. i'm so busy that it would be nice to do my personal business on the go instead of from my computer. i hope that these features will be available soon otherwise i will have to cancel after my 30 day free trial.
no longer works properly. since latest update i can no longer do anything in the banking section. i can’t accept or change any transactions.
great. helps me track all of my business needs from estimates and invoicing to financing. great app!
easy to use. intuit would benefit by watching what new users struggle with. one major thing i think would be nice is an easier way to account for merchant fees when processing payment receipts.
keep up the good work!. i really like the platform. it is very user friendly. it has to be for me to figure it out. works every time i use it. no crashes. keep it up!
great app!. this app saves me so much time! it lets me run my business much more efficiently! wouldn't be quite as successful without it. it also has very professional invoices and estimates
. since they changed the app its not working properly nothing appears on the dashboard and can't produce invoices
. great business program
3 stars. doesn't do everything i would like it to do but overall pleased with this app.
please fix. 1. when creating an estimate or invoice you can not add the project location. 2. also i have an item for notes on my estimates which should not show any price numbers (0.00) 3.i can not edit the way estimates  invoices look. i try it in android and apple both apps have the same problem. if you fix that the app will be perfect.
password paste does not work. i use a pw management tool and can no longer paste it into the app. this is really annoying as my password is totally random and 15 characters long!!!
love it. i'm no doing anything super sophisticated but i love the app. easy to use to keep invoices and expenses current on the go!
didn't work for me. kept getting an error that i don't have an online account. yet it asks me to verify and gives me my cell or email to verify with.
. i'm amazed by how much i can do quickly in the app, but the number of touches it takes to switch back and forth between screens gets old fast. the app dies every time i switch to a different app to look up a piece of information, and when i start the app back up, it has completely forgotten what screens i was last in.
. i don't know how to express or show and i am not going back and back or round like a clock. wise, but i only know 1+1% i am still in? so i am going to use quickbooks account. and thanks again. i'm happy for every thing.
stop downloading.. i have redone load company data every time i log on the app which can take hours, and essentially makes the apps convenience useless.
kerry pabian. are you kidding me !!! app is crashing on my ipad since the update ! why do you always do updates right before its time to do billing ?
. it's been years and the login still fails 80% of the time. have to clear data in the app just to login. it's a nightmare.
beautiful, so simple.. really great app.
not able to login. never download this app. i have reported this error many times to the quickbooks support team. till this date they haven't even just looked into this issue.
. love doing invoices and estimates right on the phone
editing chart of accounts. i love everything except for when i'm editing my chart of accounts. when i go back to upload pics of receipts, fix categories and dates the phone app on iphone crashes. it's been doing it for several months. i have passed on the information, updated my phone, updated the app to no avail. very frustrating as it's an integral part of accounting for my small business.
small business owner. i have been skeptical about leaving all my business information in an external server, thinking that one day, the software seller is not longer in business. intuit has given me that confidence and now i am very excited with services i have received so far. the program is easy to set up and easy to use. very friendly menus. you can use as many functions you wish. is good even for those who have little experience keeping track of business.
item searching is harder then it should be when creating an invoice or estimate. wish there was a search bar that filters through my sales items easier. i should just type in a few letters and all the related items with those letter should pop up
. great app
too expensive. i do to want to pay for s subscription , i just want to buy the software
. buy the extras!
2x features missing from making this 5 stars.... 1: ability to do ‘purchase orders’ in expenses 2: ‘void’ sales invoices
. this is not mobile supportive app in india
crashing in on the reliable. overall not a great product  i actually do enjoy quickbooks online. but this app is just atrocious. history improve in so many ways just to get one more star out of me
slow to respond from time to time .. the app is sometimes slow to respond.
. i am really happy by the way it helps me keep track of my expenses and consumption taxes. one thing i would like to see on the mobile app is being able to view your taxes, same as you can on the desktop version.
. i love this new app
where are all my estimates????. in our business the estimates are the most important... most of our customers on app do not show their estimates!!!! if we cannot access all our estimates through the app...it's worthless. since i can't run our business from my ipad...quickbooks isn't for us..
great app. i am enjoying staying on top of things while on the go.
. always been a great app! wish we had better designable invoices but oh well. thank you!!
. good app
well made basic accounting. quickbooks online has been extremely useful. i have a small contracting business, and i can record an expense in seconds, photo the receipt, create an invoice or estimate, and email these to customers. syncs instantly and automatically across multiple devices, so it's on my phone, tablet and online. the cost is tiny, and it takes care of itself  no more shoebox!
getting too flaky. i’ve been a subscriber for about 2 years now but am now randomly getting locked out of the app where it thinks i don’t have a subscription! i’ve reported the issue , it always gets resolved but then returns ! went to do my accounts and quotes this weekend and guess what .... i’m locked out ... again! is that acceptable for a business app ! definitely not.
bank sync. errors while synching bank accounts for matching invoices. this is a basic function and not sure why they cant fix it. account shows as not deposited though its in bank. please fix this.
i spoke, they listnened. i have had my fair share of frustrations with intuit and when they send out questionnaires i answer them and my biggest complaint was no access to a p&l which is now apart of the app. it's perfect for what i use it for and there's nothing like creating invoices and getting paid on the go. great update and thanks for listening.
improving phase one detsiling. awesome app to help budget and keep my finances straight. the one feature that i love is how our customers are not only sync online on our computer but also our iphones and android lg tablets. that is priceless
. don't make a mistake on quickbooks online! if you do i was told by customers service that i would need to delete all transactions 1 by 1. i have over 10,000 haha. or to delete this account & open a new account, which i did & was told i would be refunded. nope! i'm now being double charged now. thanks quickbooks for wasting a few days of my time and getting nothing done & have to start all over
easy to use. love this app, easy to use.
love this product. i've been using qb for years. every year it get better than the year before. i won't use any other accounting software.
great app. allows me to enter expenses right away.
sales manager. love this app very easy to use has all i need to conduct business on a dayli basis
experience getting worse. entering transaction requires way too many taps. it isn’t location aware to suggest transactions you just always search. recent updates have some bug that makes the app download the data file with almost every login and login often you must. usually twice a week it loses my password. i have enjoyed quickbooks online but this app experience may have me evaluating competitors in december.
unreliable. seems to have several issues when using apple products. macipad or phone.
. great app except one thing... why is intuit nickel and dimming us for tools and apps. i can understand pay extra for using the payroll feature in the actual program but paying for an app is stupid. if they made this app free i would be will to bet sales for software and online versions would increase more than enough to pay for the app development and running costs. other than that, great app.
. this app makes my life so much easier.
. the app is unusable and highly inferior to the web interface. when you create an invoice, it always defaults to retail invoice without the facility to change to tax invoice, so i'm forced to use the web interface for invoicing. suppliers activity always shows a blank page so again need web interface to view suppliers balance, expenses etc. can't you people make a decent app ?
great app. it works great on android.
". downloaded the app to be able to view estimates and invoices from phone while i'm away from my computer and someone calls wanting to know ""how much did we have in this job or that job"" well, the app is prettt useless when you have hundreds of estimates out and you're trying to find a particular one , but there is no ""search"" tool to look for what you're trying to find."
easy to use, no enough control. the app looks great and is easy to use. it does not however, give me basic options. one example is that i can't seem to add the cost of materials and labor for an item that i sell. only the price of the sale. i have to manually add in expenses for each item. it's tedious and doesn't give me a good reading of how my business is doing.
. great app, sometimes had trouble with login
. easy to navigate! great app!
"missing some elements, overall good. i like this app. great to be able to give client receipt right away. wish we could do deposits and reconciliations and change default ""payment due"" area."
terrible. i have had nothing but issues. last financial year it worked fine now it attached to my bank account it’s shocking. press accept for payments and expenses do the full month, i then go to profit and loss and shows no where near what i put in. 4 hours of my life i won’t get back i give up and cancelling my subs
app stopped loading after ios update. please fix
. i am a electrician and gas engineer, product is great , can do all invoicing on the move
good but app missing functionality. the app does not compare to the desktop version. the app does not show menu item for employees. i am using android and have reinstalled as advised by qb support but it makes no difference.
. great app
. awesome app
so much better than sage one!. can you compare two apps and have one be easier to use and more powerful? yes.
". ""get paid faster"" is a lie. it is intuit policy to hold funds for 6 days for your first credit card transaction and, at their discretion, any transaction after that."
so easy to do books on the go!. i cannot say enough about the convenience of the app. i use it as soon as i get paid to log payments on it novices and enter sales receipts. this app and hiring a bookkeeper have been the best financial tools for the success of my business!
. very good app
pdf note on ipad. why can't we add a pdf note on ipad app. i can do it by accessing desktop version on ipad. but it's a pain doing it that way. it would be simpler to add that option to the app. come on guys keep up with the technology. quit lagging behind.
. apps bad after last update... you can't easily see invoice and or estimate amount anymore, you have to click each invoice & estimate to see numbers... i will be changing program's soon if not fixed.... we need to be able to easily scroll up and down the hundreds of open invoices and see where things are, not open each invoice to get information... way to timeconsuming... can't screenshot what's going on because the update before prohibits this now.... please devs fix
. generally amazing but not perfect i like this. to be able to do this on the move on my phone is great. i have had a few issues with my personalised invoices and some of the functionality which i added.
. having trouble switching the email account i want to use with this app. it keeps defaulting to my phone email.
changed our business. from the first version of this app with the online version of quickbooks, this has changed our business. no more scribbled notes on sticky paper or back of a student roster. sales are done immediately and nothing is lost or forgotten. my only request is to please add time tracking fit our instructors into the app, then it would be perfect!
very weak. i have been a quickbooks user for years but the app is just weak. employee transactions are not possible and reports are minimal. i consider these critical aspects of good accounting software and they almost do not exist in the app. i don’t need an app to write an invoice or figure out that someone owes me money. however, keeping track of my reporting to the government and paying employees is critical and these do not exist in the app.
this has helped me have a life. without this software i would be buried in paperwork . it helps me stay organized. i have been using one version or another since 2003. thank you
. the app makes use in the field easy.
. great app. for business on the go. love doing invoices com my smart phone.
. i have had this app on my phone for years. i tried opening it and i was told to update the app. so i did. now it will not open. it just keeps telling me to update. i have uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it still does not work. my business is important and this makes me very mad
". getting this message for the last 3 days on my android. ""there was a problem syncing your data. wait a few minutes and try again"". please fix this edit: i have done all those steps, cleared cache, uninstalled, reinstalled, gave all permissions, even did a full factory reset on the phone and still same issue.."
great app. works really well easy to use good customer care
. great app. very functional.
amazing app when it works. haven’t been able to use this app as of late because i use a password manager and the quickbooks app stopped allowing me to paste my password into the password field at login. tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, still didn’t work. this issue has to be fixed.
good app and makes life easier. it's a easy app to use and simple to navigate.
crashes. app crashes every time i'm using a lg g5 emailed support for help 3 weeks ago no response.sent response never heard back.
verging on useless. download it but don’t expect to get much out of it. how a multibillion dollar company can produce a product so lacking in functionality boggles the mind. it’s almost as if intuit is intentionally trying to offend its customers.
. helps me, my customers, and my accountant!!
service after the sale is nonexistant!. i’ve been trying to get incorrect billing corrected for almost a month now. customer service directs me to my sales rep and the sales rep no longer responds to emails from me or his coworkers in customer service. try waveapps...it seems to be comparable to the simple start plan and it’s free!
good but few bugs. i can see some of the expenses and bills of some suppliers but not all. i would think that if it syncs it should sync for all no?
great app!. easy to navigate and great to have access with you at all times. love it!
. doesn't give the full qbo experience, if it is it's not the same ui edit  dislike that devs pick what they feel is most convenient.
not a good app. too many bugs.
. goid app
feedback. the app would be better if you were able to enter bills not just expenses. very annoying to have to also use my desktop computer to finish my book work.
. i would like to create, edit and update projects in the app. thanks
. the best business app
took out deposit option! why?. i can no longer record simple deposits from the mobile app. i’ve been using quickbooks online for over a year now and make use of that functionality weekly. why did they take it away? not every deposit is an invoice payment.
love it. just be cautious when trying 30 free trail. i loaded half a dozen customers and lots of estimates,invoices etc. and then purchased the 6 month subscription after i got familiar with software. well it led to doing work twice. because you can only have one or the other, free trail discounted 6 months subscription.
excellent companion to your quickbooks online subscription.. i rated this app lower than 5 stars when i first reviewed it. purely because it showed my invoices in usd and not gbp. unfortunately there was no way to change it once set. recently i had to completely reset my phone. this gave me the opportunity to install the app fresh. this time it picked up my local currency correctly. so, 5stars from me now.
love😻this app. must have for small business owners.. or even for personal use. don't know what i'd do with out it. been using for 3 years now😊
good start, but i need to enter time tickets on this app.. hopefully they add that feature soon.
love it. i'm no doing anything super sophisticated but i love the app. easy to use to keep invoices and expenses current on the go!
. still relatively new to quickbooks, but the more i use it the more i like it. the mobile app is proving to be a huge benefit!
love this app. i enjoy all the features it provides and the simplicity of using it.
. pathetic app works too slow with a fast internet connection.. takes hours to get refreshed highly disappointed
not ipad friendly. although the web based system works pretty well from a desktop or laptop it is very unfriendly on the ipad.
discount. why in the world would you apply the discount after sales tax? in the mobile app, you cannot toggle the order. ridiculous.
qbo app. great to know i can do invoices etc on the go.
review. someone pretending to be quickbooks last year fraudulently took roughly a thousand saying they where i.t saying it was for servicing wish that i was told by email or phone call to look out for this type of thing
. great app
horrible customer service. horrible customer service
not what i would have expected!. had the 2010 desk top version and upgraded so the bookkeeper and i could use it at the same time. just disappointed...but trying to be open and learn it better.
. where do i start. purchased to help with accounts for small self employment business. did not upload new transactions from bank account or paypal as advertised on app or the full site. mileage tracker was not accurate. user interface too basic. so frustrating as i would use this constantly but as it does not upload my transactions properly, it is unusable. far too glitchey as an app. wish i had done free trial and not wasted money on it.
great. always easy and concise. great to do my invoices on the road!!
. great app for small business!!!
. fairly easy to use however it could be smoother when you enter new transactions instead of having to go all the way back to the drop down menu.
. explain to me why i cannot screenshot anything any more? i have multiple customers that like to see their over all balance owed but now i can't send them a screenshot anymore. so you update the app to fix things, manage to mess up the one feature that worked best for me and still haven't fixed th spelling on the word supplies (it's literally spelt suppliea). great job!
very disappointing. they frequently change the interface and items move or get hidden. e.g. customers formerly in the dashboard hidden in sales. frequently i quick on a document on a list and the wrong one opens. lists open in various formats for unknown reasons. my favorite lines of invoices disappear when i switch browser tabs to get more order information. hard to believe quickbooks has such a good reputation.
great for business on the move. this app is a solid connection to your quickbooks and allows for quick and straightforward posting of expenses, invoices and estimates.
. seriously? this is the best you can do? ! so limited on basic functions. *updated review nice try quickbooks on the reply...no, your laughable update is ridiculous! not to mention the mobile device website lockout to access via mobile browser.... taking away another star for bad public relations. welcome to 1996 if you try to rely on this app for your 2014 business.
worst service. changed a template i have used for invoices and estimates for 5 years without warning or reason i cannot access the ones i sent even one week ago customer service said i was using a classic template and it's gone and not coming back . makes zero sense it's 2017 get a clue . don't buy don't join charge back!
very good for business!. quickbooks is a great app for managing the everyday finances for my business that i just start. no matter what is a small business, this is the right one.
"what are you thinking qb???. when you send invoice or proposal email, it doesn't come from your email but from ""qb do not reply email address"". so if customer wants to email you back with question or addition they have to start new email thread."
unique landscaping. it’s simple to use and helps to keep up with you’re accounting, totally recommend it
. nice to use on the go, however does not always organize invoices in order of customer despite having it on that setting
great app. great app. can grab my ipad anywhere and do what i need to do.
what’s going on?. i’m paying almost $11month for an app that “can’t update payment information right now.” this has been going on for weeks. i can’t even send current invoices. pointless to have at this time.
qb makes me look good. qb app is fantastic. i can write and present an estimate right at the job site or give my customer an invoice, or accept payment. in brief....it makes me look good!
very pleased client. i love this app. it has saved me so many times. there are a couple things you can't do on the app that you can do on the desktop like change your payment information but i have no issue with that. thanks intuit for another great product.
bugs and bugs it a jungle. 1. kicking out of the app very often. 2. not able to email multiple invoices at one time. 3. limited search capabilities. cant search notes and description. :(
. re routing several pages.. but not able to sign in.. after installation of app and having my all personal details it's showing that we should go n check desktop version.. then why it's as android app?
very useful!. this app allows me to send clients a sales receipt as soon as they hand me the cash, invaluable when visiting clients.
quickbooks phone app. so easy i can’t believe it.
c'mon, you know you need it. subscribe already. better than zoho or jobber. very organized and useful. such a time saver and it makes my company look 5 times more professional. recommended!
great software. thanks
. quickbooks is amazing. i use it for my company and have never ran into any problems. they have a wide spectrum of things you can do, and the are probably the cheapest options for accounting software. #quickbooksforthewin
. it takes a little while to get used to the interface after switching from desktop, however having all my financials updated in real time and at my fingertips is awesome! wish i would have switched years ago!
. it's a good app. it's a little complex compared to others. it's like it's made by accountants for accountants. not made for people who need help with accounting.
good for on the go. good for on the o, definitely not the same as on the desktop, but pretty good app for most things you need to do quickly
very good and getting better!. qbo has been a great addition to our company and has many great features over qb desktop. there are some bugs to work out but i'm very happy so far with the online application.
crashes. it now crashes. tried several times. updated everything. looked at website  no help. very disappointed, we pay good money for this.
quick book rocks. best accounting package ever made. it links to your bank . cards directly. no need of much accounting knowledge. provide login to your accountant. operate from anywhere.
pathetic on ipad. i don’t know why intuit bother to have an ipad app. it never works, has less functionality than a browser. the latest update tells you your account doesnt exist, the exact same log in as a browser. someone in the development department is being paid far too much for a substandard product. avoid the app like the plague
good application. very useful and handy app. thanks qb
pretty useless. can't mark an expense as billable therefore can't create invoices by automatically including up billed expenses can't record deposits can't view downloaded trans action useless
update broke. i cannot accept transactions. the only things accessible on the baking screens are back and trash. please fix otherwise it’s useless.
. need user mode in apps
. excellent app
multitasking?. would be nice if app supported multitasking.
doesn't work on ios. unable to login. this is a known issue with qb and ios9. support states it is indefinitely not working. guess they don't have anyone capable of writing code. intuit is a real company, right? embarrassing.
appliance men. great app.. 💯. all you need to run your small business on the go ... team it up with square for the ultimate in portability team both up with an ipad and you have excellence
useless for sure. qbo is useless. can’t login with google account. forces me to create a newseparate password. can’t really access qbo via a browser on ipad. overall terrible experience. i’m sure it’s equally apple and qbo fault.
i love this app. this is the easiest to use and simplest way to use it.
very happy with app. the app is very good, and provides a lot of useful information that can be sent anytime, anywhere.
there are other options .... not with the $35 dollars they take in addition to % of every transaction. i would suggest another program and app. i personally would like the app to be able to send reminders for invoices but the app will only send them out.
liars. they lie about the app and what u can do with it. run away fast.
. i've been using quickbooks for a few years. it's been great. but lately i haven't been able to access old invoices or quotes. very inconvenient for past work that we've done. now i'm having a huge issue with latest data not syncing to my device and can't even get into my account. things should be getting better not worse. i've consulted with customer service which hasn't helped either.
pathetic. when will intuit wake up and get a real program for the ipad? very limited unless all you want is invoicing....disappointed....was hopeful at one point but have had it with intuit
simply perfect. this program allows us to work and function mire effectively
very glitchy. i like the features... when they work. i often open the app to a black screen and have to shut down my phone in order to get it working again. please have this fixed. it happens at least once a week.
why doesn't it update banking?. all i want to do is import my banking transactions and deal with them. i would think this would be basic functionality. i spent spent over half an hour on the phone with support and talked to 3 different reps who ll claimed to know almost nothing about the app. seriously, why do you even have it.
. nice accounting apps.. very usefull..
. great small business app for on the go!! love it!
. doesnt work on my google pixel 2 or pixel pad.
kerry pabian. are you kidding me !!! app is crashing on my ipad since the update ! why do you always do updates right before its time to do billing ?
. awesome app. makes running my business so much easier when i am on the go!
easy and effective. very easy and convenient, would just like if they add the ability to create a purchase order to suppliers from the app.
major flaw  can't run payrol. 3 stars as you are unable to run payrol on the go which is a major part of this app that is missing.
. can't edit invoice # can't edit invoice # so if you aren't entering the next invoice in line (like if you skip a number) there's no way to save it correctly with the correct invoice number. fail. tells me i've already got the next invoice # entered bc it won't let you edit invoice #. what's the point of trying to do it mobile if you're going to be told you have to do it online? waste of my time.
not accurate. even after the most recent update the app still dose not accurately reflect my qbo account. all information on vended and clients are not up to date. this had been an ongoing issue for more than a year now. i keep hoping with every update this will be correct, but nothing yet.
decent. if there was a crash course in it, it could be the best app but it still gets the job done 😁
hvac. allows me to estimate, invoice and collect right on site. i don't need all the extra reports payroll, not as this point. so great for my company.
no bank rec?. how do i get bank rec. myob n xero do
still many bugs. still too many problems to be solved
good on the go. it’s easy to make invoices on the spot for customers and receive payments. i still prefer sitting at a computer but this app really helps while i’m on the go!
. less useful than dealer version. convenient but sufficiently different from qb pro to require retraining staff. many favorite reports and easy navigation missing from qbo. constant strongarm marketing to upgrade or add features removed from qb pro (ie. payroll). very handy to permit off site accountant to review at their leisure
very nice!. i love have this power in my phone! i can email invoices or print them out, all on my phone! this app is easy to learn and soooooo fast when you get used to it. there was a lot of thinking when they designed this app, wow
will not stop asking for a review. trying to get work done and having to swap back and forth between invoices to get the numbers. made difficult since every time i switch back and forth it asks for me to review the app. well, there you go, 1 star, now let me work.
meh. dislike so many things about the app and online version. i would really like the ability to browse through invoices for ex. look at invoice #1 click next to see #2 and next to see #3 and the. be able to reverse this. unfortunaly this can't be done and one has to search specifically for an invoice by number.
logging out.... every time i open the app, it logs out. so now i have to keep my qb password with me. love qb but hate this app. have raised the issue, been ignored.
amazing. thank you for keeping it simple.
crashes every time. i used to like this app, but now it crashes every time. i cannot use it at all. galaxy s7 edge. support has not responded to my messages. nor my crash message notifications (and there have been plenty)
worth it!. i got the 10$month plan and it is totally worth it! you can connect your bank and organize all your expenses. view reports and detailed graphs! even plan future investments! it’s handy on ios mobile (iphone 8). and imac.
worst in india. i install it after that i it not support in india can you suggest me other options for android
all is a life saver. great support team even if you can't figure it out yourself
bookkeepers or better only! too much info available to users.. this app would allow a salesman taking orders to view way too much information. it's nice that it integrates with the qbo program, but what am i supposed to do about salesmen that only need to check inventory and write orders? surely they should be excluded from the company books! very disappointed in the time i wasted talking to intuit salespeople who materially misrepresent the functionality of the program
very weak. i have been a quickbooks user for years but the app is just weak. employee transactions are not possible and reports are minimal. i consider these critical aspects of good accounting software and they almost do not exist in the app. i don’t need an app to write an invoice or figure out that someone owes me money. however, keeping track of my reporting to the government and paying employees is critical and these do not exist in the app.
i can't get in. once i log in it loads and says error an d doesn't work !
. i wish this was a completely free app.
most productive app. using this app on my iphone and ipad hs made my life so much easier! i've been able to invoice my customers without having to lug me laptop around. truly an awesome app!
makes life easier!. helps me keep record of everything from invoices, payments customers and expenses. all from my phone
. nice and easy accounting software but the prices is high
update killed app for me!. used to love this app as i’m a paid subscriber, but the recent update doesn’t launch anymore. i’ve tried removing and reinstalling same result. iphone x.
ios 13. app crashes before opening! please fix asap!
awful!. this latest update is awful! i have had nothing but problems saving notes and attachments. plus it looks really weird! i like the previous version much better, it actually worked! thanks for messing up a perfectly good product!
. won't let me add bank accounts. app is useless.
not useful at all. this was a waste of time. i need to be able to reconcile and do more than look at my recent transactions. quick books is useless unless you're on a computer.
. good accounting sofware, horrible on intuitively usage. just try and make an estimate or invoice online with an android tablet or phone and you will experience what i am talking about, it is very lacking the ease of usage, also lacking on choices when you select services, clients, and want to make a quarry forget about it! for accounting it works but, to simple for customer management.
. you want a app to work this one does it works as it should
. great app. life gets easier.
poor. the program is slow and it is hard to find what you want. does not compare to their desktop version.
. no longer working at all on my phone which is how i do 95% of my business. nobody to call or get a hold of to fix the problem since it is a 3rd party app.
quickbooks online. there are a few little glitches between phone tablet and desktop but all in all it's a great program saves time works really well for customers send an email to confirm payment is nice adding a customer in your phone does not work but as long as i use the administrator adding names as i go it works well in the field
. i can receive money's from clientele and keep all of my expenses organized in such a simple way!
payroll unable to handle contractors. unable to pay contractors on 1099 also their supports work around took more time than outsourcing payroll. wuuuuuuut? ? i have used quicken since computers came out and it looks nice and works great for (normally) most things. cheers
. very good and intuitive, i had trouble recording all my sales, but it's super practical with the app
disappointing app. you can’t really do anything productive in this application. it’s extremely limited in functionality.
don't waste your time. everything is centred at getting your secure bank details. so they can send it off somewhere unsecure. total waste of time. smooth to use but practical use is zero. for example you can not input expenses on the go. what's the point of the app then? so many little drawbacks. at this stage intuit should have had these things covered.
. this update is very bad. activities don't come up anymore. have to navigate to long to find stuff... i don't need to see company details first. i need to see customer activities.... this is such a waste of time and very frustrating. now i have to search for a new program. the app on a mobile device doesn't even open. it says sync problem. it's been days since i logged into the app. always problems with this company. the app is terrible.....
update crashed. i have all of my quickbooks point of sale ipads that cannot open the app since the update! we have all had to resort to computers and phones to run our business! you may want to consider this before you join up with quickbooks! they are notorious for problems relating to their quickbooks online.
. extremely useless and convenient!
never has worked on my s7 edge. i loved this app when it worked with my htc. since i switched to this phone, it keeps giving me an error message and despite talking with support multiple times, nothing has been done to resolve this. i have uninstalled and reinstalled the app multiple times and it has not resolved the problem. i have seen similar issues reported with this phone.
crashes w ios 9. app crashes after you enter password. intuit has had 3 months to test on beta. customer service has no idea what ios 9 is.
broken app. unusable. app fails to load company data. waited an hour on the phone and never got help. killing my ability to invoice customers while mobile, which is the only reason i chose the online version that i pay for every month! intuit is not intuitive, they're only into your money. zero support. zero answers. zero. the worst.
great app and the best accountancy system so far.. i've tested many different products from competitors and quick books is the best so far. i've used online version first and then downloaded mac app which is quite fast to use. mobile app works seamlessly with both and its great business tool. i don't really understand other negative reviews and people having issues with software. please make sure you're using latest updated version of the app and your ios. thanks matt
can't create new invoice. very troublesome considering this was an app i raved to people about its efficiency yet now i can't even create a new invoice and earn money... just paid for premium too. very disappointed and would like my money back for each day the app is rendered useless.
offres aux nouveaux clients. je suis client depuis le début nous avons eu beaucoup de problèmes au lancement, le support était moyen... aujourd'hui il y a beaucoup d'offres pour les nouveaux clients mais rien pour les clients fidèles. et une fois en place... impossible ou presque de partir et d'exporter ses données pour un logiciel sans abonnement. le produit est désormais fonctionnel et agréable mais cher pour une petite compagnie.
. contiuous problems with syncing data and logging in. the contact center has been terrible to deal with and provide no help at all.
. great app
exactly as described. it does what it is supposed to. i am a longtime user of the desktop version and still do, however for a fledgling small business that is mobile the online version is incredibly convenient.
. quickbooks online has been an invaluable management tool for my small business. i give professional estimates for services & am able to create invoices, receive payment, & track income, expenses, etc.
just say no.. qbo is a horrible, flaky and unreliable. pushed out long before it was ready and there is no escalation for problems.
. app freezes and crashes several times a day. the photo receipt scan feature is probably the biggest culprit. even simple things like updating my business contact information yields an error message which is usually followed by a crash. the mac version of qbo isn't any better. similar issues there. very clunky, buggy applications. too much time spent troubleshooting. time for an alternative.
waste of time. horrible sync, features missing. do not waste your time.
. great app easy to use.
. if you have a card associated with your phone.......... the free trial will automatically charge you!!!!! and ........... the is no real way of deleting your account!!!!!!!! i've called, chatted, went into google play & can't do it from there either. when you call, if there was no card added to the account, that still doesn't mean that your card won't be charged thru the card on your google account!!!!!!!!
awesome. looking forward to seeing what's next!. there's times when i get fuel and the gas pump printer is out of paper. i pull out my phone, snap a picture of the purchase and expense it. brilliant. i would like to itouch login option. it's not to cool punching in your password while shivering. thanks qbo.
. can no longer open app, error returned from client
. absolutely the worst. they cost us $3,450 that a customer sent to us as a payment. they held the money from us and them. an the rep was so happy, they even closed down our account. sad
easy to learn and use. everywhere access, integrated bank and credit card transactions. easy to create transactions on the road.
. seriously guys, this app is constantly updated, but still moves at a glacial pace and consistently crashes. get your business in order so we can keep ours in order!
too extensive and yet not thoughtful enough. here's what's needed: 1) mush better limited user access ie. for delivery drivers who simply need to obtain signature but have access to all company info in the activity feed (!) 2) needs to offer lic storage for invoice signatures instead of requiring data connection as this function absolutely kills phones' battery life and also often doesn't work in concrete laden loading docks and larger buildings 3) need the mobile version to incorporate the purchase order system!
cool app. very convenient, i'm yet to use it to its fullest, but i love the way it alerts me to payments i need to make or should have received. very happy.
love it!!. makes life easier being able to enter transactions from my phone!
solid for business. great app for a small nonprofit. easy to navigate and i appreciate the prompts!
i need to actually work!. this would be an awesome app if i could do more than just send estimates and invoices. there are other tasks that need to be done and it would be really helpful if you could do everything that you can do online.
great product!. importing my company file from desktop to qbo was a breeze. love the interface, ease of use, and having access to qb anywhere i go.
perfect. works great for my contracting business. i mainly use it for estimates and invoices.
. sporadically unable to log in. app now says that the internet connection is offline which is nonsense. for a paid subscription app this has way too many issues. not good and definitely not recommended. there are better invoicing apps for less money readily available.
. sluggish app
disapponted. thus app us completely worthless to me without the register.
. very easy to use and really great accounting app
. good app
"missing some elements, overall good. i like this app. great to be able to give client receipt right away. wish we could do deposits and reconciliations and change default ""payment due"" area."
. great app
unusable. stopped working after ios 13 update, can't add expenses and support is unresponsive
very much helpful. thanks quickbooks!!! your the best!!! only suggestion is hopefully i can also view on mobile app the quantity on hand of my products... thanks for making it easy for me to manange my inventory!! i love quickbooks i use this on my 3 branches 😊😊😊
not helpful. this app doesn't help me. i get errors every time i try to match or categorize a transaction from my bank. it's useless for me.
description is misleading. there is no way to enter or see expenses in this app and of course no way to attach receipt pictures to these expenses. you can enter expenses using computer and attach picture of receipt there, but not in this app. if you need a plug in to do that, why not to say so? or just remove missing components from description.
. love being able to work in quickbooks from my phone! one of the best features is being able to take a picture of your receipt and attach it to your expenses right from your phone. makes your bookkeeping incredibly easy! wonderful customer service, love the payroll, too many good things to say about this app.!
life saver. apart from the fact i have to input my password every time, this app is a great compliment to the version i use on my laptop. so easy to use, can invoice on the spot. very happy.
. really slow compared to desktop
. great app , looking forward to getting the full version.
great app.. helps so much w billing... highly recommended. .
yamin it solutions. great application
excellent app. keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
very handy little app. as said in other reviews it is a little different from the computer version but it is such an easy way for me to do my invoices on the go! it's all set to go and it tracks all of my invoices and sends me reminds of unpaid one too! great little helper!
customer service and functions. you can be completely locked out upon renewal of your subscription. it has locked me out of entering for the last six days. tech support has been pretty useless at fixing it. with all the other flaws the online program has, avoid with every thing you have. you get no back up, high incompatibility, and many accountants hate it. your emailed invoice has a habit of hitting the spam bin,it isn't even compatible with other intuit products. avoid avoid avoid
. the app is a wonderful accompaniment to the software which makes tracking expenses and invoices really easy
very satisfied!. been using the mobile app for the past 3 months now, and i can say it does everything i need. very easy to issue invoices, receive the money, match, reconcile the bank. the support people are very helpful and have a lot of patience!
qb mobile. we use it at our retail location. love the integration the mobile app gives. its a nice feeling to know i'm always on the same sheet of music no matter where i'm at. excellent !
. great app. i love it.
please fix this asap!!!!. this update is horrible and does not work properly at all! data doesn't refresh and i keep getting error messages. the only (very temporary) fix is to delete the app and redownload it  daily! lame! this must be addressed immediately.
one best app for accounting. one of best app for accounting
quick book user. amazing app ever
like the app. just hope it would be easier to use need better access to my custumers invoice and estimates
waste of time. glad i haven't gotten past the trial offer because nothing syncs with my quickbooks online. so the obvious question is what's the freaking point of this app? completely unimpressed. someone's making money off of doing nothing. wow. i want that job!
. using a samsung note edge: cannot update estimates at all. been using this app for months and it constantly locks up and crashes. in response to the developer: it seems i have to reinstall it every day just to get it work. i have been doing this fix for a long time and it still does not resolve the locking up or crashing problem.
cannot reconcile bank accounts on app. cannot reconcile on the app. completely useless to me as the bookkeeper.
good app and service. after the last update, i can’t create an invoice after i add a customer. it crashes every time on my ipad. it still works on my phone. please fix this issue.
. great app! it makes doing my small business easier!
it’s ok, but.... it not very useful as field service software. it’s painfully sloooow to use. even on the pc it’s the same. the software crashes when i need to use it or it’s syncing.
. pretty easy to use, makes things simple 👍
. awesome... works across all of my devices so i can invoice, receive payment and create customers wherever i am. i can even check to see who has and hasn't paid me and send a reminder email to them if needs be, all from my phone, tablet or laptop... should have used this ages ago instead of previous well known others.
no good color and texture of sreen. it hard to seen no c olor in photos
major problems with the newest update!!!. the app was working great until a few days ago. now i cannot receive payments on my iphone due to a bug in the app and i also cannot send an invoice via email on my iphone or ipad now. ☹️
good......but. would be perfect if you could set up recurring expenses automatically instead of having to enter the same thing month after month.
absolutely terrible!!!!!. this app is garbage. funny that intuit is in their name because there is nothing intuitive about anything in this app at all. complete waste of time!!! complete garbage. just trying to set up the basic information about accounts that i use and tailor the app to my needs was excruciating. i can’t say enough about how bad this is!!!!!!
qbo app rocks!. finally, we given the proper tools to make educated financial decisions on the go! thank you intuit!
statements. can't send statements or use bundles in the app. email customer services about it and they send you a email about doing it on your desk top. been asking for 6 months to have it added to the app. just get the same response while they add useless gimmicks to the app.
qb app. great to have this access.and it works !
perfect for construction guys. i'm always running from job to job and the mobility to give estimates and invoice is on the spot is priceless... plus the customizable terms for each buildercustomer with the added alerts helps me stay on top of receivables
easy. i use it to view the position rather than a tool to raise invoices etc, a nice addon
. easy to use app!
. most used app on my phone
great app. easy to use.. i would like to see full desktop functionality on the mobile app.
. syncing of data is not appropriate. on online it is showing latest data. on mobile always showing data one month old. worst experience.
inventory & stock control. where do i find the inventory & stock control feature to invoice stock to the customer! is there a warehouse feature because my stock is also kept in different locations!
. very user friendly great app great technical support i recommend it to anyone
perfect for small bussines. utilisation simple et prix aceptable.
great for my small business. i could not run my business without online quick books and having it at my fingertips on my iphone, ipad and iwatch means i can check things on my downtime like when i'm sitting in traffic.
. this is what happens when a company gets too large. first app worked fine and then suddenly refuses to connect to my bank. customer service is a joke. reps were unable to figure out why error 103 kept appearing. after two hours on the phone i was then told it is a systems issue that needs its own ticket. two days later an email arrives stating that the issue is resolved. guess what, it wasn't!! come up intuit! you can do better than this
not impressed. started using the app because it was recommended to install it with quickbooks online. the app does not show any up to date transactions that were entered on the quickbooks desktop version, you cannot search by phone number or address only customer name in the app also. i would have thought the app would have been more useful to use while out in the field.
. i do a lot of running and this app helps when you have no time to sit down.
app times out occasionally during entry. app times out occasionally while i’m using it. when that happens it deletes the transaction i was working with.
. cool app.
. maks invoicing on the go fast and easy. just write it up and send it to their email.
worth it. great to organize business. love the online support when getting started!
. i hate your new update where all i can do it take a picture and its magically submitted and i can't add any of my info that i need linked to that receipt
useless. the app keeps crashing, if you’re in the middle of typing a long estimate or creating an invoice, it crashes and your file is gone, you have to keep saving your project, otherwise when it crashes, your project is gone. very disappointed, going to a different app or software at the beginning of the year, three years with this crap, paying high monthly rates, and for nothing.
. terrible. my bank account will not sync and support refuse to contact me. no transactions show up other than the ones that appeared the first time i downloaded this app. definitely not worth paying for the full version.
. great app to keep and control all aspects of your business.
scared. i added the app. haven’t used it yet. i read some of the awful reviews. decided to delete it. not worth my valuable time. don’t think it is necessary to go through the same nonsense everyone else has gone through. you may want to call it the power of reviews and lack of response from the people in charge.
excellent customer support.. features wise need lot of improvement. still giving four stars because of excellent customer support.
. doesn't have my back in its list, so it's useless. i've cancelled my subscription. when i contacted support, they were obsessed with my subscription, rather than the actual issue.
missing key functions. whilst i understand this is a mobile app, even the qbo version lags behind in key functions from its desktop predecessors, all of which intuit has had ample time to upgrade to fully integrated functionality. intuit needs to put full functionality above the profit margin and put customers above dollars.
"access. i was going to download the app until i saw the list of ""access needed"". confused why they need my contact, camera, photos, etc. to run financial program. seems a bit intrusive."
. perfect in the website version. but in the mobile version when we want to find the product cannot search by sku very inconvenient.
. i would like to use on my laptop and can not, it won't let me use it here, only on my phone or tablet where i originally signed up for use. i can't do all that work from my phone and i don't want to. if i can't use on my laptop, i will have to cancel my subscription
garbage. this app is junk!! support for this app is useless looks like i will be going back to freshbooks, it may not be a accounting solution but at least it works and i can import my info without manually entering. my business doesn't have time for me to spend hours with support when i need to be taking care of my customers ms support
. does not work its rubbish app
. great software. will continue to use as long as it makes sense for my business!
app constantly glitches and it's very slow. i've had so many issues with this app. lately it has been extremely slow, it randomly shuts down for no reason in the middle of inputting a transaction and it won't load larger invoices. i'm very disappointed as i use this on a daily basis for my business.
great for billing while traveling. this app is very hearty. i was worried how it would work from the ipad but it was so easy. let's me bill while i'm on the road so that i can keep my cash flow in order. great job, inuit!
crashes. app is unusable after ios 13.0 update.. crashes. app is unusable after ios 13.0 update.
easy to use. generally easy to use. some limitations on app.
simply, beautifully... brilliant. i've no need to log in via the laptop until the end of the month... the fact that i can capture, create but also review my expenses, my p&l and notes is simply brilliant.
. for over a week, the app has been failing to load my account details. i sent the error report by email too. i am using the correct login info and i have a samsung galaxy s10 plus. the app is poorly designed and maintained... spending all the money on those commericalsads vs on the actual product, not looking to renew once our lisence expires at this rate... we can just build our own system instead or use other functioning ones..
. awesome app. makes running my business so much easier when i am on the go!
great app!. this is a great app! only reason for 4 instead of 5 is that there is restrictions to the app but not online. i do all my business from my phone so it would be great if the app was more adapted so i could do everything from my phone.
good expense tracker. good for tracking expensing. everything else really needs to be done from the desktop version. handy little app, but it needs some work to truly run things from this app.
. won't let me sign in from phone (s10). app is useless unless used from computer
love it!. quick books merging your gmail contacts and being able to add and subtract expenses lays your invoices out really well and makes everything so easy! clients get all the information this way and it leaves them without surprises. because of the convenience it forces me and reminds me to enter all the information that i would otherwise forget to include.
so far so good. i've been using the app for a week and love it so far. i find it extremely easy to make invoices in the field, and also very convenient to accept payments.
keep crashing. after last update keep crashing. new update came just an hour ago still same crash???!!!doesn’t launch the app please fix asap
. it makes invoicing easier
ez modern business book keeping. i love this app program... it's very ez to apply it with your business services.. download it 2day!
. very happy with it.
love it!!!. i can use this app on the go!!!
great app but....:.. good application but we need features that enable generation of reports
annoyed again!!. i did the latest update and now i can’t even open this damm app! terrific ay! any suggestions qb’s!? can you get this sorted asap. a few updates prior to this lasted one, after that particular update all my company details except my abn disappeared, why? the app didn’t seem to save my details properly as i added them and it was like that until the following update. then everything was back to normal. pretty annoying!!
stop downloading.. i have redone load company data every time i log on the app which can take hours, and essentially makes the apps convenience useless.
not happy. when i first got the app i fell in love i had problems with the desktop version , with the bank option on the online version witch you removed i was able to log in my transactions very quickly , i would appreciate it if you would please bring back the bank option in the menu asap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
. good app
. square app is so much easier to navigate on mobile app. plus square has instant deposit. quick books i have to wait 2 buisness days at the least. horrible.
. the only down side i find that i cant check the inventory from the app which rely effect the mobility of it
crashed. our quickbooks crashed a week ago. they haven't been able to fix yet. frustrating
great app. accounting on the go!. ahh my favorite part of the day just got a whole lot easier. this app lets you track you individual transactions on the fly. it also lets you categorize and itemize expenses. if you like neat books and your on your phone a lot this app makes things easy. it's free so just try it out.
. the app is super easy to use and understand.
make fit 6 plus. can you make this app fit the 6 and the 6 plus? that would be cool!
. acho ótimo, muito organizado e intuitivo, tanto para uso profissional quanto pessoal.
simplesmente o melhor!!. usei vários softwares de contabilidade ambos para desktops e aplicações online, sage, xero etc nenhum chega aos pés de quickbooks! sage online a performance é abismal!
quickbooks. this app is excellent and the version on my computer is even better save's me hours when quoting well worth the money.
works sometimes. account synchronization works sometimes. paypal often stops working until i log out and log back in online. bank account takes days to update. not a great app. integration. integration needs some work.
. would be 5 stars if i could get my bank to integrate...pain in the butt to upload everything, every month.
tremendous. great app been using quickbooks over the years on desktop version specially go on mobile is the best way to go there is a couple tweaks that need to be worked on for example keeping track of inventory etc. and so forth been using quickbooks pro help ticket update these features as quickbooks from other than that it's a starter
i need this app. i really need to use this app. but everytime i try to create an account it says connection error. i have been sending multiple emails about the same for the past month and no reply. five stars if you fix this problem
not like the online version. the app is alright. missing a lot of feature (if you compare it to the online version) but if they come up with a solution and have them on the app version i would rate it 5 stars.
useless. this app is useless because if you have an online account with mac or pc you cannot use this app on your ipad! save your time, don't download it.
. nice app very usful and conviniant
. app keeps crashing on lg g6.
awesome app.. make business on the run fast secure and simple. thanks quickbooks
. love having my accounting on the go. missing a few key features in the app but hopefully they will be added soon. sure beats manually reconciliation of a paper check book!
. app has no functionality. stick with online version.
. this app is rubbish. it doesn't do the single thing you'd think was necessary using phone camera to take photo of receipt to attach to transaction.
. great app foe reciepts
terrible terrible service. i was under the impression that this was designed to make accounting easier for small businesses. emails asking to upgrade with special offers open you new accounts! no option to snap receipts and have them automatically added in essential package which was the main reason we chose it.
. help. i am trying to log in for a while but it keeps saying that there are technical issues and i need to try again later. i have been trying to get in for taxes and can't.
love qb online. i love everything about it. my favorite features are the qb app and being able to process bids and invoices from my phone! and being able to accept online payments thru the invoicing feature is awesome too.
useful but slow. quickbooks online in general is useful for sending out invoices and estimates on the go, going through expenses, etc... however the platform can be fairly slow and sometimes glitchy.
love it but..... seems like new technology with some bugs. also some reciprocity issues with what can be done on app as opposed to phone. i know intuit will refine and well worth it. it is helping me streamline my business networking system!!! love it and look forward to giving a 5 star in couple years!
user friendly but i will have to start from scratch. there is no way i can pull my two years history from my online account. the customers and vendors are not available either. not useful without importing all that data.
fee increase is a bad deal. fees increased but same services rendered. otherwise it’s a decent app. i’m disappointed that they get people to invest all there invoices and history in app and program then up the fees in them nearly double. can’t trust a company that does that to ya.
accountant owner. easy to navigate and control
. love the app feature! i'm getting work done on the bus!!!
no supplier invoice. invoices from suppliers can not be captured on the app. you have to log onto the main website  which is extremely slow and cluttered to navigate on a mobile phone.
. great app. easy too use
. well app
. app is crashing as soon as it starts... 🙄 edit: app is now working, i wish all features of the desktop version were also available on mobile.
*terrible app*. do not take the chance with this program its flawed at best and is only designed to take as much money off you for as long as possible. it has multiple errors all the time. find something for better value and don’t pout it in control of your business because when it fails you have no control whatsoever.
great app. need security code.. the app has lot of confidential data. please add security code to open the app, similar to quicken.
. great app
app crashes on splash screen. on iphone 6s plus. this has been happening for so long and there is no action taken. i’ve tried uninstall and reinstall multiple times and nothing is working.
best business app yet!. i love using qb for my small business it has been one of the most important things in my business. ease of operation, receiving payments and financial reports are just few of its great qualities. thanks qb!
great support. i love the support you can get when having difficulty or when trying to find a more efficient way of doing things. i just wish i could load more than one photo at a time as i often attach 3 or 4 before and after photos and that is very time consuming.
. great app
. this app has one major flaw in my view. my bank transactions do not update unless i go through the website and update it there. this is probably the only reason i have this app. this is very annoying and i have contacted quickbooks about this issue and they are not helpful. they tell me to go to the website and update it there! would be a great app if they fix this issue.
most of the buttons don’t work anymore. how could you make something this bad? buttons like accept transfer do not work. if this this was any more of a dog, it would shed. wake up and fix this over priced piece of poop!
good resource. i will update this as i see necessary, haven't made a customer service call yet. but overall the navigation is something to get used to because it's very in depth and many details that you would expect are included with the software.
quickbooks is wonderful. there is not a better software on this planet.
. excellent app
great app!. 2 thumbs up!
easy. real good, compatible with my metro phone.
qb online. personal accounting made easier
. that this app has great potental.
. great app to use along side quickbooks online. i like being able to send estimates and invoices on my mobile device with the quickbooks app!
love the software. understanding that all software are more friendly on the actual computer than in the cell app, even though, the cell app is very helpful for invoices, estimates, reminders for payments “on the go” just to mention a couple of them. being an 8 years user from checkmark multiledger and payroll and making the transition to quickbooks is just a huge step forward and very efficient for my firm.
quick book app works amazing!!. love using the app for my tree company lets me be on the road and make up invoices.
invoicing easy. easy for invoicing etc, but less intuitive for expenses and linking accounts etc. especially as it will or allow me to sync my main business account!!!
. simple, easy and quick. easy to use and keep your books. highly recommended
down graded. from april this app is unusable. i down graded to qb online. it appears it was released about a year too soon. nothing but frustration from day one. the ipad and iphone is useless.
horrible app even if subscribing!. subscribe to the app yet they want me to pay for a new subscription, waste of money for months!
need an important upgrade. i love the app and all the updates but we really need to information from journal entries to show up in the expenses on the app. it shows up on a computer but the app gives us false information.
. great app
great for mobile businesses. i'm reading the current version just a 2 because they claim to have touch sign in on the iphone but it does not work properly
keeps crashing. crashes on latest ios version on iphone 6
. good software, could be better if cis content was accessible via app
thumbs up. great addition to the online software
touch id stopped working with latest update. touch id stopped working with latest update. otherwise a great update. please fix!
great accounting package. love the mobile apps!
. great app i love it
recommend!. quickbooks is a must have to swiftly complete business tasks like, estimates, invoices, etc.
brilliant!. easy to use, matches payments received and ties them off with your invoices, easy to see profit and expenses for each month. well worth the monthly payment, my books have never been so easy to keep!
. this app no longer works. i cannot make invoices, sales receipts, etc. i called quickbooks and they said there is nothing they could do. i have a mobile business and relied on this app, now it's useless.
". the app hasn't gone far, sorting a report won't change for ""this financial year to date"" u can select another option but revets back again. .. has so much potential.."
not bad needs a little work. online is getting better with each update. still needs more options with mobile and ipad. one for sure needs to have bank account option on payment received
no longer works on ipad. this app is no longer functioning as of the most recent update. it used to work on the ipad. the camera feature is difficult to use when trying to take a picture of receipt. it doesn't allow me to record payments any longer. please fix.
great app. for my business is been really helpful app. i'm a painter contractor, check job all day, if i need to send estimates and invoices now i can do it on the road.
independent contractor. i love this app being able to have everything on my phone... the monthly dues are definitely worth it!
. great app
great app. app is never up today's with invoices. the app has become useless to me other than being able to find customers phone numbers and addresses. please fix asap.
almost perfect. just missing two things, send invoices by text, fax, edit or view notes online
best way to get paid.. easy, professional invoices, cheap and most importantly time saver
. love this app
made to measure. this online accounting package fits like a glove. after using the desktop version for some years this is now streets ahead in terms of speed of accessibility, very user friendly with very good visibility of information on the home page and excellent tracking of sending, viewing and tracking emailed invoices. simple excellent for my purpose.
awesome. can't imagine running my business without this app. total complete solution for mobile businesses like mine. my accounting is done so much quicker, and i love being able to see all client info from the phone. thank you, thank you and thank you!!
great app. easy to setup and use.
after the update. before the latest update i never used the app as i have to attach signed work orders. now? it's awesome!
best alternative for mac users. my accountant wouldn't work with the mac version 2013, so he suggested we use quickbooks online. having the ability to manage the business from anywhere, on any mac or idevice, is a game changer!
pretty good app. have an issue with multi tasking. app doesn't stay in the multi tasking overflow menu, so when working with my calendar, i need to manually open the app again from the app drawer. pretty frustrating. it's supposed to be a productivity app for small businesses, but its really not
productivity. love all the intuit products. helps run my business professionally. been able to do my own scorp taxes and payroll for a couple years now. saving me thousands over a cpa and payroll company like in previous years. business owner now for 26 years
good software, app needs work. quickbooks online is a great way to manage your business. this app, while functional, still needs some work
complete garbage. does nothing but give me an error when trying to sign in... fix your crap qb! followed your instructions to uninstall then reinstall.. still does the same thing...
johannes. owner very good accounting program my accounted dose not care for it online but owell i like it
very useful application. it really helps me stay up to the minute with my business goings on.
great tool for small business. i'm a self taught qb online user. was very intimidating at first, but what makes the difference is the amazing phone support staff. they are so patient and professional, i've never had to wait long for them to answer either. i highly recommend qb for anyone who wants to understand their business better and make better business decisions.
"too many missing features. can't add time entries, even simple ones, have to pay (a lot) for a third party app. not acceptable for a single user company that doesn't sell products, only time that needs to be tracked. can't view current ""sales"" status of unbilled items. can't email myself receipts and have them automatically entered as expenses bank transactions that i've excluded keep showing up. again and again. i'd like to configure away unused modulesfunctions from the menu"
. this update is very bad. activities don't come up anymore. have to navigate to long to find stuff... i don't need to see company details first. i need to see customer activities.... this is such a waste of time and very frustrating. now i have to search for a new program. the app on a mobile device doesn't even open. it says sync problem. it's been days since i logged into the app. always problems with this company. the app is terrible.....
very easy and convenient!. i love having the mobile app. it makes it easy to enter transactions on the spot without having to stop and open up my computer to login.
great app. works great for customer signature!
great app. great on the go accounting application
best app for accounting. i used another app before but quickly switched to quickbooks. it is by far the best out there in the market in terms of features and ease of use. i am not an accounting expert but now i can quickly generate my financial statements and get funded. thanks a lot!
great app!!. just switched from quicken, and i don't know why i waited so long. qb is very versatile and comprehensive.
. its a good program. need to be able to do credits.
. absolutely horrible customer service having multiple issues but because they can't duplicate it they act as if it's not a problem i have to delete my app and reinstall just about every day now because it says there is suspicious activity when there isn't and on the samsung tablet the app will not let you do negative numbers for discounts
refresh invoice?!?. trying to add new items to existing invoice with partial payment received and won't let me save changes! refresh invoice means what, exactly? without this function why do i need my subscription? made office work harder as now must go submit through pc and pray that works...
great features but very unstable and poor support. i’m an accountant that works with xero, qb and myob. quickbooks online offers probably the best combination of xero and myob’s best features but is let down hugely by the app’s instability (very slow and regularly crashes) and their support, whilst very friendly, is poor in quality and suffers from obvious lack of proper systems and workflow. we’re holding off recommending qb to clients for these two reasons. they aren’t quite deal breakers but close.
excellent companion to your quickbooks online subscription.. i rated this app lower than 5 stars when i first reviewed it. purely because it showed my invoices in usd and not gbp. unfortunately there was no way to change it once set. recently i had to completely reset my phone. this gave me the opportunity to install the app fresh. this time it picked up my local currency correctly. so, 5stars from me now.
great app. first time business owner and have to say it's a great way to stay organized
love quickbooks. we have a small business and quickbooks is so simple and straightforward to use, it saves us so much time, and i can write and send invoices straight from my phone! love it.
love it!. why have i wasted time on quickbooks when i could have been using the online version! so much easier to use.
needs improvement. i love the desktop version but my app version and even the online version never works right! there is always something that doesn't work. i always go through the whole estimate or invoice and then it won't save it for me! very frustrating and i wish they could work out all of the kinks.
excellent software. so easy to use, it's great and self explanatory.
"it doesn't synchronize. the app is totally unusable. it doesn't synchronize customers and supplier and the transaction with those missing from the list result as incomplete. tried also to dis install and reinstall: same story. on top of this it must also said that the assistance is unresponsive, many days and repeated enquiries to finally get emails full of irritating smileys and useless answers like ""we are constantly improving the apps to serve our mobile customers""."
. good apps
. love this app
love it. ian finally able to track my expenditures and income totally on the go. no more playing catch up! love that i have receipt images and that i can make notes that will refresh my memory on the exact thing i bought. just getting to putting my logo on invoices... i know that there is a lot mor that i can do with this program i am very much a beginner love what it does so far!!!!
excellent. i love this app. best ever
does not work on 3g. i am unable to use quickbooks over a cellular connection. this has been the case since ios 9. sometimes after certain qb updates it works, then others it won't. i will be making notes of the versions when this issue occurs.
terrible app. quickbooks is a terrible app on my iphone & my ipad. it's not even a good program on my computer. it's extremely limited & each update does nothing to improve it. if there was another accounting system i could use, i would.
owner. great app
great for a busy contractor!. i can send invoices or check on my bids from the job site. very convenient!
no problems. just a decent easy tool for your business which will save on time and money. can’t complain!!
excellent. app and program does everything i need. its much better than the program i used previously and very user friendly.
constantly having to sign in!. i wish quickbooks could figure out how to not have the app constantly make me reenter my password.
ios 13 doesn’t work. keeps crashing in ios13 faceid log in  can u fix it please
doesn't work. omg i'm so frustrated with this app...now it doesn't work at all on my note 5 i've report the error so many times and no reply
great program. great program and its user friendly too.
quick books app. absolutely love this app, its works fabulously well on my iphone. my only gripe with the app and it's operations is that not all of my customer emails that are sent are being received by my customers. i have highlighted this to quickbooks and they were extremely unhelpful in assisting with rectifying this matter, which i found extremely disappointed given this is a paid subscription service, and not a free service.
nothing works for me. nothing works for me with this app. if i login using desktop, qbo is ok but when i use the app, there is no information; no clients, no invoices, nothing. the subscription says i have a free trial until 2037. phone support was unsuccessful.
solved my invoicing problems. now i can invoice quickly from anywhere. then track and record payments. very simple yet powerful. love the mobility.
". wow, fell for it again. still listed as free, yet is payware. my bad. free download does not make it free. older version: not free as advertised. 30 day cinderella ware. fine, but they should clearly state that. i was impressed until after setup they informed me. my bad; l should know better. their advertising says it's good tho. uninstalled b4 review. ""while it isnt free"" it said it was free."
can't open.. i loved this app. i could work up estimates on the spot. add my receipts. it was really functional. i just got a note 5 and it won't even open the app. if not fixed soon. i will cancel my membership.
nearly perfect. except for the fact that the previous version i used just needed me to upload a photo  take a photo & the system crunches out the info for me on the receipt. now i literally have to input the details. :( please restore this feature for this version too...
sales receipts please. can you add the option to add sales receipts please? great app, thank you.
business owner. used desktop for years and now after switching to imac and iphones this app is perfect and couldn't be easier. recommend this to anyone looking for an accounting app.
. awesome app for my business
. great app very helpful when your business is on the go
. really easy to use. highly recommended. would like to see payroll either included or developed separatelylinked.
good program. been using this software for about 6 months now and find it very useful as a sole trader it works for me i can pick up my phone and write an invoice straight away.
. installed on android yesterday. cannot see anything on dashboard. called customer service and they don't know anything about the issue and can't help. she said she can see it on her iphone. account can be seen on desktop version but the mobile app is useless.
great book keeping app. use this app with the online version at home. very happy with it indeed. support could be a little better. but support is adequate. been using it for a couple of years and i'm very pleased.
good and bad. i converted from xero and i am finding quickbooks has its advantages & disadvantages. i don’t like how the custom invoices are so restricted with gst. the mobile app banking function is excellent.
. very good and useful!
. it's a great app
really bad app. this app is really bad, lacks everything you would want from a app that is suppose to work with you online quick books. no registry access!
. using it to track expenses and take pictures of receipts. working great for me.
. this app has, literally, changed my financial standing. as a fantastic it engineer but rubbish at business management i would struggle to arrange invoices for the many small jobs that i do. now, with this app, i'm able to raise and send invoices on the spot!
ok but frustrating. doesn't do as much as online version. lots of error messages when downloading bank data. poor customer service, not responsive when errors flagged.
so easy. this app is user friendly and intuitive. i like being able to see the reports and add attachments to expenses. highly recommended for small businesses owners.
not free. not a free app, just trial. tfn. re: your response, like i said it says it's free but it's not free..
. nice site to make invoice and estimate, if there is any option to maintain stock it will. be great
good app. i like simple, this is efficient for my small busines, updates are making the app better. i can recomend it is supper easy to use.
great flexibility. love being able to do estimates and invoices on the go.
. good app. looking forward to the future and a full use of the online version in the app.
. simple, effective accounting, easy to understand and tweak to personalise.
awesome. it saves me so much time. great to keep up with my business accounting. mostly simple to use. some features require a bit of basic accounting knowledge.
app not working on my phone. app is currently not even loading before it crashes. nextbit robin on marshmallow 6.0.1. sent error report weeks ago and nothing yet...
easy iphone app. i like it, it’s easy enough to navigate on my iphone. you cannot do everything that you can do on the computer but it takes care of most business.
. very efficient and in depth of a record of labor expenses and profit
. my exsprience was very pleasing. you guys are truly good at what you do! thank you! julius
very useful. great app yo keep up with your income and expenses. i just love the way everything is set up.
easy to use and quick customer service. love this app for my business. makes it easy to keep everything up to date and keeps the books accurate. i recommend it to every business!!
great app!. i was using quickbooks pro desktop 2013 before going to online 2016. all i can say is wow! i never realized how much i was missing. reconciling expenses with automatic bank and credit card transaction downloads can be done on my phone anywhere and anytime. no need to log into bank and manually download. huge time saver. also keeps me up to date on my finances with great reporting built in and at my fingertips.
. can't log in why won't it let me sign in? this is awful! please fix quickly!!
where is the cost of the app?. where is the cost of the app. you gave me all kind of information but not the price of the app!!???
qbo ipad better. qbo for ipad is much better. the report functionality on the ipad is very much effective. if reports functionality is added this app, it would be much better.
serious billing issues.. the app started out wonderful. i could do anything i needed on the fly, then my monthly renewal came along. my card had expired, so i had to update my info and resubmit, not a big deal. it has been 8 days and they say they can't do anything about it, except convert me over to intuit billing, which is almost $10 more a month. i would not recommend using this until they get things figured out with apple billing.
this app is useless on android.. i can not believe that this app is this bad. i can only see customers invoices that i have been to in last 2 months. i use to be able to see 10 years worth of invoices. please fix asap. unless you can carry a laptop at all times which is not practical this again is useless.
easy and it works!. simple, yeah!
. great billing software
crash crash crash. it used to work but now it crashes right when i try to open it.
. very frustrating app to use. as an employee i am required to log my daily hours using quickbooks, the app however won't let me even login to it. i go to login and it gives me a message telling me that i am trying to use an u supported role and it will be fixed in future updates. i have to go through the website which the mobile version is not great to use.
great app. keeps everything so easy, nice interface and functionality
. this app needs a lot of work.
. good, but... it doesn't have all the features of quickbooks online on the computer. it would be nice to manage expenses from my phone and to balance account registers. edit: with expenses added, it's now a more complete mobile business manager. happy to see the forward progress. keep adding the new features!
spotty & unreliable. i rarely review any apps that i use unless they are particularly great or particularly terrible. in this case, sadly it is the latter. this app doesn't have basic features that should be included, and about half of my invoices i cannot open from the app because apparently it uses some feature in their api that is nonsupported or not working. regardless, if you are looking for a 21stcentury accounting solution and app this is sadly not it at all.
doesn't work. app crashes on load and while logging in. pretty useless so far. :(
. very convenient app. makes business much easier.
worst update yet. just deleted. crashed. didn’t update banking. five star to one in a flash.
find someone else.. their help desk refuses to speak to the actual person who handles my business books and wanted to do nothing more then waste my time when i have business to run! square is looking even better! 112019 updated response to quickbooks. the person was on the account and had full access. again wasting time and money and horrible customer service.
android app. android app on phone lately does not open...
can’t access. i can’t access quick books off my mobile then i am unable to access it off my laptop as well, i log in and it just does nothing on my laptop and when i log in on my phone it logs me out and says i don’t have mobile access..
bookkeeping on the go. i own a small tax and accounting firm and this app has done wonders for customer service! being able to give my clients real time information from anywhere at anytime is a huge plus!
introduce me to accounting. i love the app, it's giving me a good idea on what accounting is about. i'm kinda looking forward to take this course in the fall :)
working great. app is easy to use on the go. some things are better done on desktop but for the most part can do a invoice from phone and accept payments.
great product!. importing my company file from desktop to qbo was a breeze. love the interface, ease of use, and having access to qb anywhere i go.
great app!. very userfriendly and convenient. great for people who are needing to create invoices and estimates and track expenses. the iphone app is fantastic!
just what i needed. i run a small contractor business doing remodel work. the mobile app has been a godsend. i can track all my estimates, invoices & expenses in one place. helps me track clients that are late payers too (which sometimes happens). i like it. 100% worth the subscription
meh... large app, slow and expensive. looks nice but loading times are slow and not all sections display properly on a phone.
. updates regularly. keeps getting faster and more stable with each update. thumbs up 👍
. excellent way to utilize your phone to help keep track of your expenses!
why pay for a subscription. when i bought quickbooks for the computer?
quickbooks online on macbook. quickbooks online is constantly crashing while i'm creating my invoices. every time i enter a line entry i have to take the extra time to save it because the program will freeze up and i will have to force quit and restart the whole invoice over again. i rate it a 1 star only because i can't rate it any lower.
ok but.... qb is ok. major flaw however when trying to look at a customer's order history. the list of invoices does not show the memo so you can tell what item the invoice is for. this is a serious problem.
the best accounting program on the market.. the best on the market
please add signatures options estimates!!!. i love this app but it could offer customer signatures agreeing to terms on invoiceestimates features. for example if i send an estimate via email, customers can reply back with a signed estimate allowing me on the other end to place order since i now have their consent. it will save me a trip on having drive out to their location for a signature. please add this feature!!! pretty pleaseeeee.
. cancelling your subscription seems impossible. i've emailed, called, used their help menu. it shouldn't be this hard. still trying to cancel.
. nice app
. this app is not free! as soon as i signed in, it asked for money!
i love this app. easy to use, transfers well from computer to cell phone. absolutely love it.
very convenient, but.... working on the road, quickbooks has been making the accounting an easy daily task. at least until their recent update. opened quickbooks and voila, it did an update. completed, and now it’s no longer compatible with my mobile computer. a little more difficult to use, they have a mobile app for the phone which saved the day, for the moment.
awesome app. this app really helps me keep track of all my transactions for my pool business. easy to use and has everything i need.
so easy!. keeping my books and budget up to date is so simple now. no more hurriedly scratched reminder notes that end up getting lost or having to wait to update my registers. great app!
love this app!!!. it's come a long ways in being user friendly. i do wish you could have the access and control you have from your desktop to at least review your reports. see your registers.
needs better support. i thought this was a great app then it wouldn’t allow expenses to be uploaded, one of the main reasons for using this on the mobile app, support we’re worse than useless and could give no time scale as to when this would be fixed to a small business working on the go this defeated the whole point of using a mobile app, am looking for alternatives
. ok for a mobile app
. great app very useful
excellent product. great for sending estimates and invoices on the go. everything i need to see right at my fingertips and very user friendly.
. good package
. have been using this app for quickbooks online, an amazing interface.
. great software. do your bookkeeping from anywhere. covers all the bases. if the customer asks for an invoice, send it to them while you are standing there talking to them. then have them pay right from your smartphone. no more excuses.
app crashes on ios 9 and ios 10. when i click on support it takes you to a web page that also does not work properly. do you have email support ?
where is the payroll functionality?!?!. the app seems to intentionally not include payroll functionality, that’s what i need most! f
love this app. i have a small bookkeeping business. i love that i can create invoices on the fly usually in less than 5 mins. i can also send the invoice via email as soon as it's saved. very easy to use app if you have quickbooks online
happy. works well. as intended. nice to be able to rectify transactions on the go.
. makes running my business so much easier
. i think this app is a great addition to the computer and laptop for the small business owner on the go.
very disappointed.. right now i'm looking for something that can run with my business. looking for more features less bugs and more useful.
great for cell phone however.... i originally gave five stars however the app doesn't work with tablets that don't have a wireless carrier. so though i am on wifi it won't download regardless of the os meeting and exceeding the requirements. aside from that great app when used with my cell
help. hate trying to get help this way, but my app keeps crashing. i love my online version, but basically i can’t do anything with the app. would make my life so much easier if i could
negative stars.... emails won't send to customers... misspelled quantity on invoices... not complicated to fix, no customer service, destroyed my management system, i regret switching...
. pretty good app.
great. great app for on the go use
. great app & software. very helpful. would be nice to be able to keyword search within all estimatesinvoices.
. why does it keep saying that there is technical difficulties in using the app? even before prior update, it had this issue. no issue with the ios app though
. decient mobile program to use, prefer the desktop version though
. like the portability of this app
lousy service. spent all morning trying to upload an expense only to be told i had no internet connection. can't it determine i have no server connection? so most of the morning i spent in one que after another and finally hanging up. i must say that the convenience of being mobile outweighed the inconvenience of not having too much versatility, but only if i am able to be mobile. i hate wasting time, and so i want payback.
. love this app has been extremely helpful
the android app is so diffrent than the ios app.. ios app has the functionality to select multiple items too an estimateorder with the multi select feature. this is missing in android. also before the update, the send comand asked the way we wanted to send the invoice and we can select email, fax application. but with the update it only send with the quickbooks email. cant send by fax anymore. please provide the share option on invoice and estimates atleast.
simple things just don’t work in this app.. now i can’t copy my password from my password safe into the quickbooks login. this means i will have to use a simple easy to use and less secure password. also, there is no way to enter check numbers into the bank transactions. this works fine on a mac and online but not in the ipad app. these simple problems make the ipad app almost useless.
scam. not happy since day one. i got totally scammed. not very helpful but exceptionally good at taking your money. they can’t do anything technical and continually stuffed up my app so it was unusable. i’m now suspicious and worried as they have access to my finances and data. i will look at fair trading to report the company as i cannot get a refund either.
saves so much time. i got this app to help save time and it does. it took awhile to set up and i have had to phone for help a few times and they have been fab. i can send invoices and receipts form my phone. i am able to keep up to date on my accounts without the effort.
complete garbage. does nothing but give me an error when trying to sign in... fix your crap qb! followed your instructions to uninstall then reinstall.. still does the same thing...
. realy awesome app
accounting made simple!. love it,love it.love it!!!!!
. good ... getting better i hope that intuit continues to realize that mobile computing is tyebway of the future and thus, they continue to invest in this app.
awesome. user friendly and far better than any application available... i love it
great app for accounting on the go!. i don't know why people are disappointed in this app it's an app, not an entire accounting software. plus it's free! i love this app. i can create, manage & send invoices on the go. that's all i need to do. it has a simple interface. kudos to qb.
need an important upgrade. i love the app and all the updates but we really need to information from journal entries to show up in the expenses on the app. it shows up on a computer but the app gives us false information.
. does not show my payroll infopay stub. just doesn't work well on the app : not even on mobile for my samsung s9 using samsung internet or chrome. only works well using a computer or laptop...
great!. continues to impress and improve on this very useful app. i use it daily for bids, invoices and expenses. the addition of the ability to record expenses and photograph receipts has made my life so much more easy. and to be able to quickly add clients, easy estimates and quick invoices and finally receive payments is unbelievable and wonderful.
ability to get paid, in my pocket. if all the quickbooks app allowed me to do was create and send invoices on the fly, i would pay for it. it is that and a lot more.
does not work well at all very frustrating. frustrating
crashes every time. when app is installed i can log in to my account. then the app says « downloading data » and when download is complete it crashes. if i open it again (so still logged in), i cant even get past the launch screen.
business owner. very good app ,thank you
crashes all the time and there’s no way to ask for help.. this app crashes every time i update my iphone, even when i update the app. don’t even bother trying to contact qb about it, they’ll tell you to uninstall and reinstall (like you don’t know) and then that’s about the extent of their support.
great ui. wonderful companion to the browser based qboonline for reference on the move.
great app. i've started using quick books as i switched from kashflow it's much easier and has a great user interface.
. very nice program
business made easy. use this app daily keeps everything organized
crashes all the time. no matter what version this is, it always crashes on me. i never use this this app, although it would be fantastic if i could.
fantastic application. i love this app. it let's me manage my expenses and easily invoice on the go. great tool!
bugs and bugs it a jungle. need to be able to email multiple emails at one time.
. i love this app, it allows me to work from my cell, ipad and laptop.
"app now totally dead, cannot login at all.. can't login anymore, giving a weird ""suspicious activity detected"" error and refuses to login, running android 5.0. works fine on my pc, osx laptops and ios devices. this is a known problem on android. see this https:community.intuit.comquestions1281477cannotloginmobileapp. still can't create purchase orders on android or ios! that's almost a deal breaker for me. i can search for items while creating invoicesestimates in android  but not ios?"
. love that i can create invoices and estimates on the go. although i would like to manage payroll wirelessly.
self employment. great app
bad update. each time i go to use the app i have to fully log in, choose what company info i want and have it reload everything. in the past i used to use my fingerprint scanner or a 4 digit code. needs to be fixed.
great for business, especially if you drive a lot!!!. this app is great as well as the self employed app! make sure you do your invoicing all on one. they don't work together and have to reenter on desktop or quickbooks app. you can select personal or business for mileage and customize trips. all in all this is a great app!
quickbooks online + app. quickbooks online is making my business accounts so easy. the bank connections feature allows you to sync online accounts straight into your account records. when new transactions are available, you can view and add them straight into your accounts, made easier by quicbooks match feature that marks transactions with previous similar transactions. support during setup period has been excellent which has made switching from another online accounting software quite an easy process. very impressive so far.
. not intuitive. bad customer satisfaction services.
decent.. the program is regularly requiring me to update my accounts and will not auto update and refresh my bank accounts. not as user friendly as i thought it would be.
. i use this it's very useful and cost effective
not a good app. too many bugs.
app keeps crashing. even when i try to leave feedback the app crashes. no issues on desktop.
. nice app...very usefully
. this just makes things so much easier to keep track of and you give customers more, and easier ways to pay.
mr. brilliant accountancy software,simple to use in the office or on the go.
. can't do payroll, can't edit a register, come on intuit, $600 a year and this is your app!
can’t subscribe after trial period. it’s a good quickbooks version but i started trial period made a profile and invoices but the app won’t let me renew subscription the buy now button doesn’t work when clicked on. now i may have to start another profile and lose everything?
good. they fixed most of the problems and added features i suggested and i am happy with the results
. great and..comfortable. app. but they. should lower the price.to.small.bussines
there is no sku column. quickbooks online is great but if you are a reseller good luck sending a p.o because it doesn't have a sku column so the mfg won't know want your ordering. this is the worst thing that and you can't do sales orders.
ab online. great program. really ups the efficiency.
good app for business owners. i think the app does a good job with tracking expenses and billing. as a whole i think there may be better programs out there. do you research before signing up.
. so far i'm pretty happy with it. since i run a very small business i don't have a big budget for bookkeeping, but luckily, quickbook offers just about everything i need with very affordable subscription fee.
great job!. now i know when an invoice has been emailed. very complete app! now we just need a bulk action.
hvac. allows me to estimate, invoice and collect right on site. i don't need all the extra reports payroll, not as this point. so great for my company.
awful. it's so confusing i hate it can't seem to manually enter stuff have to download from hsbc but other accounts i use ie trade card & fuelgenie aren't recognised so it refuses to set up & let you enter stuff manually. i so much preferred to enter everything manually you know where you are with this i haven't a clue it's all over the place. i want old fashioned quickbooks that was easy and understandable this is a joke.
worthless. i have never once been able to generate a p&l for a board meeting. the reporting function just does not work, which is the most useful part of accessing this program through a browser. also, even though i can enter a sales receipt, doing deposits from the + does not work and i am unable to make corrections that are relatively simple from the browser. this platform provides no service at all.
subscription does not work. after 1 month free trial (in which i never been interested as i was happy to pay from beginning) the app stoped working. payment is demanded, unfortunately on ipad or iphone version either it is not possible to make a paymentsubscription or the instructions are not clear enough or there is an error. to subscribe should be made as easy as possible.
comprehensive. your accountant in your hand. seriously.
still no progress invoicing!. great app for running a business on the road. i wish it had progressive invoicing...
bad update. i was having trouble with the mileage tracker and now with the update i can’t even check the settings. please fix this. i am paying for this service to help run my business. this isn’t a free game app.
great app! great company!. in a sea of many companies like intuit, i am honored to work with them. the ease of use and professionalism are a great plus. all the stars fully deserved!
. works well. can create invoice and estimates on the go.
. i have been using this app for 6 months. $40 subscription doesn't get me receipt capture, but the $10 subscription gets it... cannot get it to save information once i enter it, tells me to call a support line that seemingly cannot help me.
. while this app has a couple of problems, the benefits far outweigh the negatives. i would recommend it to anyone in business
doesn’t work. i have an iphone 8 and all of a sudden this app stops working. i call quickbooks and they can’t fix it. they closed the case in one day. don’t walk away from this company, run away.
decent app missing features. overall the app works good. i wish it had some of the website features such as the ability to post deposits considering depositing money is a mobile activity.
. very handy app for invoicing on the go
. great program
a1. great saves money time talks to my accountant, does estimates, converts to invoice simple
doesn't send invoices. my customers stopped receiving invoices from me via email. i have to send it to myself and forward to them. customer service is a joke: they think their clients are stupid, their advices are just ridiculous: are you sure you put the email in the right section? really? i had been sending invoices via email before and they all received them.
most productive app. using this app on my iphone and ipad hs made my life so much easier! i've been able to invoice my customers without having to lug me laptop around. truly an awesome app!
it's adequate. i still can't search my customers by my address in the app, i can't pay taxes, print via google print, or do a lot of what i can do with my online version. the new version of quickbooks online even looks like it was meant for touch capacitive screens, why can't this be the same? 2 stars because it works, but it was a stunted attempt.
. excellent and simple to use
bookkeepers or better only! too much info available to users.. this app would allow a salesman taking orders to view way too much information. it's nice that it integrates with the qbo program, but what am i supposed to do about salesmen that only need to check inventory and write orders? surely they should be excluded from the company books! very disappointed in the time i wasted talking to intuit salespeople who materially misrepresent the functionality of the program
good app poor customer service. was trying to switch over my account settings and the representative i had helping me seemed very lost and wasn’t of any help. still confused on how to swap my account to a different package and receive refunds on duplicate charges. really quite frustrated. besides that the app itself provides the services i need.
soooo convenient. being a small business owner, this allows me to access all of my customers on the road.
. i'm hooked love to send estimates and invoices on the fly.
. absolutely love this app! makes running a business easy and quick. stress free and convenient! definitely recommend trying this over anything else!
really good app. ok, at first i was reluctant to use it, but after trying it i found it really easy and simple. don't wait, use it.
. great app
quickbooks app. last update is much better. use for day to day operation and quick entries.
. it is easy enough to use, however guidance from an accountant opens up more doors.
. works well. can create invoice and estimates on the go.
purchase orders. i have been asking them for years to add the ability to create and view purchase orders. this is all i use quickbooks for, and they won’t let you do it from the app!
. easy to use and helpful for pos expense capture
amazing app, but few things need to be improved.. very good app, but needs few things like the web version. if thats added then its the best app for start up businesses.
. app keeps closing right after opening even after uninstalling and then installing and also clearing app cache and data. the only update available to me is the 19.5.2
getting better. improvements to invoicing and bank transfers. but still weak at importing addresses from ipad address book.
. the quickbooks app has been a life saver! very easy to use and helps when i need to do estimates or invoices on the go.
don’t use this with an ipad.. bought this app and was unable to get it to work with an ipad. 4 hours on the phone with this company and still no success. they charged me and told me to get my money back through apple. there is an open known problem being worked on their end but user’s beware. you won’t find out until you’ve paid.
good app.. appreciate improvements made over the years. would prefer ability to create and edit invoices in detail.
small biz owner. i can't function without this app. perfect for the owner on wheels and phones constantly.
. very poor and limited app. information displayed is quite different from the web view. i only want to see one thing  supplier invoices and outstanding balances and this app doesn't show them.
superb. the app on the iphone is great. works perfectly and great for quick invoicing. the ipad app is even better as provides much more in depth information. even better both apps work seamlessly with each other. don't know what i would do without this app.
quickbooks. it's an alright app. can be too difficult. but there aren't many other options.
qb makes me look good. qb app is fantastic. i can write and present an estimate right at the job site or give my customer an invoice, or accept payment. in brief....it makes me look good!
good but not perfect.. some features missing that you get on the website for example, taxes. i haven't been able to add taxes to an item on the app. i'm sure there is an option but hard to find. also, why does it keep signing me out every now and then. i have to resubmit my password and then setup touch id again.
not so good. it keeps hanging up with an error message not connected to the internet. not very useful for business.
user friendly. works great!. great app for running a small business. easy to use for estimates, invoicing, accounts receivable, etc. can't wait to integrate it with our payroll to make billing for labor even easier. highly recommend.
it's only a trial. this looks brilliant until you've set up the account only to find out that it's a 30 trial. by that time they've got your email. well done them. clever!! immediately deleted
so far so good. it's not fussy like sage one. just nice and simple. it's saved me time just to do my invoices worth it for that.
. terrible. does not recognize my company credit card as a credit card, add o i couldn't add expense charged to it. doesnt recognize my cash account from my chart of accounts for when i tried to apply a cash receipt. clearly not ready for prime time.
great app. this app  software really saves my life.
. good summary of your business right at your finger tips. like the ability to take pictures of your receipts and enter the expense on the spot, no need to worry about keeping receipts.
crashes constantly. i hate the mobile app so much. i will be talking with a customer and try to pull up their account and then it will freeze and crash. the worst.
. can retrieve the old account but it won't re activate. created a new account and password.. can't log in. seems to be an app issue or software
quickbooks online google app is a must have. quickbooks online google app is probably the most convenient financial tool in a small business owners world. god send. www.c2kbookkeepingsolutions.com
just barely ok.. app has multiple issues . with page format. browser must use google chrome to get all options . called 3 times , on phone over hour each time . weeks later still nothing fixed . app is very limited .. customer service is a joke . here i thought i was upgrading to a better software . lol i was so wrong ..
. works great but would like the inventory to link with square to make it even better.
. used to be good but no more. cant update app for my account. out of date and wont sync. would not recommend this software now.....stay away!
great product. i like this app. can use from just about anywhere
we have qb enterprise. does this work with qb enterprise? or do you have anything that does?
great app. helps me stay on top of my business while away from the office and quickly send and receive invoices. love this app!
honestly i would rate this app 0!. app doesn't work at all, getting error every time i'm trying to login. no respond from team during a week! just stay away of it!!! if you think that your advice to reinstall would help  you are wrong! i did it already couple if times before your advise finally came in. this app just doesn't work and i wouldn't spent more time for it!!!!!! stay away of it!!!
unsatisfied. keeps telling me to contact support after trying to make an invoice very frustrating.
. this app is not syncing my data from last 15 days. even support team is not responding with resoultion
doesn't refresh. it doesn't update on mobile devices.. plz fix it so that it will be more convenient
convenient, convenient, convenient!. as a small contractor always on the go this app is great with easy access to all my info. only downfall is lack of progress billing from an invoice, but i have found a work around.
intuit quick books online. rad app! it performs quick calcs with the tap of a finger even better than the online version. nicely done!
. easier to send invoices via the app than it is on the computer. only flaw is i can't enter a negative number for discounts but that could just be my phone and not the app. overall i highly recommend it for anyone.
. good app perfect
disappointed. i just switched from my trusty iphone to an android phone, this app on my iphone was perfect! it had a list of products and services, unlike the android version. it also loaded all the estimates and invoices for all my customers, this android version hardly has any of my past transactions! please make this like the ios app!
. best accounting software for small business......
can’t generate po’s. 90% of my business is generating and sending po’s which you can’t do with this app for some stupid reason. i’ve been requesting the feature for years (which i shouldn’t have to request) and quickbooks has never responded.
. keeps asking me to install new version, have un installed and re installed but keeps sending me back to here to install so cant open my app! not what's needed when running a business.
love it. love the app, really intuitive!!! and great customer service!!!
excellent app. i cannot tell you how much time i'm saving now. i wish i had changed to online years ago.
kerry pabian. are you kidding me !!! app is crashing on my ipad since the update ! why do you always do updates right before its time to do billing ?
. my favorite accounting software!
great app. great app quick and easy to make estimates and invoices. would like for there to be more customization such as adding business information to show on them rather than just email address however overall is a great app very happy with it.
qb online app. i love it! the app makes it easy for me to check on my business, record transactions, and review reports.
new to business and this is great. i have now completed my second year running my business and without a doubt i owe some of my success to quickbooks as i don't have an admin person it helps me manage things also creates the professional image i need. i prefer using the web platform but when i am on the go and making small purchases for clients i love to add the expenses to their invoice on my phone before i forget!
app crashes. this app crashes or cannot save my data on every entry i make. horrible app!!
great program. great program for businesses. great for on the go!
. doesn't work for the last few months on any of my devices. called many times support and they said they are aware of the problem and they are working on it. this is insane!!! i'm paying every month to get the online version and it doesn't even let me sign in. it shouldn't take month to fix such a problem.
not working on ios 13 :(. it crashes right after opening. i tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but have had no luck...
. as good as it gets....can run my service business paper free and even collect signatures....simply and quickly it does it all....awesome mobile solution at a great price!!!!
deceiving. it doesn’t show a price until you’ve finished setting it up then offers a 50% discount or pay full price. so i deleted it
good app. very detailed , im no pro @ accounting but i am teaching myself this app. its very in depth and i like it.
doesn’t work on ios 13. so many bugs:  can’t send reminders  can’t modify invoices ( reaching invoice number limit?)  can’t send invoices( email is too long? )
decent. not bad not bad at all
. the app works but doesn't seem to pull data quickly even over wifi or 4g
. ok app
rnm media and sound. it’s a great app and system. lovely to use and easy to get around. they must just add online reception and receiving of payments. this will make business much much easier.
. after i finish a job i get my invoice right out to my clients, it starts that (30day net) clock ticking.
it's about time!. quickbooks online and the cloud sync apps for iphone and ipad is nothing short of amazing...it's about time and wow they did such an amazing job with the whole experience. i love that i can make a receipt for a customer on the spot on my iohone or ipad.
. magnificent app
awesome service & tool. worth spending time and effort to set it up once. makes accounting really simple and reports provide valuable insights.
excellent. intuit quick books is an extremely important account program which my business is built around, and the application is the cherry on top, enabling me to complete accounting on the go. absolutely excellent application.
login' this app. makes my life so much easier. i can do everything on the go. saves time! love it!
easy, fast and efficient. this app keeps me organized and on top of my cash flow. it is easier to use than the web interface and it's always with me when i'm on the road. as a mobile trainer, this is invaluable. once customers and vendors are set up, it takes seconds to update invoices, payments, and receipts. highly recommend.
. clunky, ugly app with barely any features. there's no way to refresh your banking data within the app, though navigation and ux is so awful i maybe just can't find it. no consistent design standard throughout with multiple different menu types, navigation styles, presentation. almost no graphics, just pages of text. invoicing, expenses and tracking are all so horrible i'm forced to use the (also underwhelming) browser version. edit: the developers comment below doesn't work as of 130619
not trustworthy. quickbooks has some issues with taking multiple accounts under the same email. i can not access my account because my email was used to open a second trial and i can not access my data any longer. choose better accounting software, overall. this app has no visible way to logout or troubleshoot.
useful. i don't use it often, but when i do its a lifesaver.
. this app makes my business more efficient!
makes it easy. i love the easy to use format and more professional looking invoices and estimates. and the format saves me a lot of time filling out forms. before i was hand writing the estimate, scanning and then emailing from my computer at home. qb does all that from my phone. it works very well for my small business.
not happy with this. i've used quickbooks for years and have several corporations that i handle on the program. i'm also computer literate and have been a quickbooks tester in the past i'm not happy that it took me a whole day to download and set up payroll and still haven't figured out how to print reports for my customers or check for that matter
"new to qb app. love it, but needs a ""statement"" tab"
not bad. could use improvements but will get by in a pinch when you don't have access to your main computer. 82317 update 1 year later..... my review stands. too many things you can't do compared to full version on my desktop mac computer.
service date doesn't work. will give a higher rating when everything works right, but that is too important to have working right for quickbooks to continue to ignore.
inventory tracking. terrific cloud software, main focus being inventory management from the web, except how do i track and edit inventory with the app version?
. fairly quick and easy to use. expenses are a snap of the camera, and it links to my bank and credit card accounts for easy reconciliation.
not as good as desktop. needs to be able to do more with employees and checking invoices and managing the dashboard
qb makes me look good. qb app is fantastic. i can write and present an estimate right at the job site or give my customer an invoice, or accept payment. in brief....it makes me look good!
not able to register my expense. most basic feature to register my expenses ia not there. i would have been nice to register my expense with sbap of bill as an attachment.
cvc. looks very promising... let's see as i used it. nice and brilliant user interface so far.
quickbooksjoist sync. none of this is working at all. for a company that does bookkeeping it’s ironic that i’ve been charged twice in less than thirty days for a trial period!! none of my invoices are synced, estinates are counted as revenue and quikboojs is stating my 90 day old business has 1000 net profit!! not even remotely possible! this is incredibly frustrating and so i have to work on this on my only day to rest. ridiculous!! do not use this app
awesome. it's taken me a couple of weeks to figure everything out but wow this a well thought out software and app!
expenses off. expenses are off. it’s showing expenses from an inactive account on the app. it’s correct on the website, so it’s definitely an issue with the app. i checked and the settings are the same. both should be displaying expenses for this month.
user friendly. it work great thanks!
accounting professionals client list incomplete. when logged into the account thru the app, i am unable to view all clients quickbooks accounts.
recent update. worked great until most recent update. can't create new invoices now. when you save it says it's saving but then just stops.
. used this software for a year in vain, they don't have invoice customization option, they are not supportive, we had to used excel for few clients and quickbook for few and this makes this software redundant
easier than all other apps. i literally tried out a dozen other apps trying to get one free or cheap. efforts were futile. i broke down and bought this one and never happier. it works like a charm and no dead buttons. does what i want it to do and no limitations.
a real time saver. as a busy professional, this app helps keep my accounting up to date on the fly. the app is extremely easy to use and updates instantly to my online version of quickbooks. well worth it!
awesome interface. awesome app. that's what it says it will do. the only problem is when i log an expense it attaches receipts as images and not as pdfs. also i do not like the image scanner it doesn't trim around the edges of the receipt. i end up having to use a pdf scanner and then attach the receipt in quickbooks online in a browser.
great app. does cost money this app. it’s definitely worth it! the app keeps up to date
good. camera to upload receipts is weird. other than that i am new to running a business and this program is helping a lot to keep organized. i think it is also going to help when taxes come around and make that a lot simpler and less scary also.
impressive for mobile. i posted a bad review because of some bugs. i received an immediate response about upcoming updates and a week later it was fixed. i love that level of support. nice app too.
. app banking does not work on android pixel 3. crashes as its loading transactions. i called quickbooks and got the runaround, didnt take my issue seriously. stuck using computer
. great app to keep working on the go.
. app works great for day to day accounting. however, the app does not allow for the use of price rules. you can set up price rules in the browser version, but they do not port over to the android app version. we use a tablet on the floor, and cabt use the app, have to login via chrome browser, which is slower than the app.
very useful. would live to see bank figures in there too
. does as promised, great extension for using quick books on the run. a must have for business over view at a glance. if your pc crashes this is your life jacket!
. best app out there for assisting in every phase of running your company
keeps crashing. for the most part, the apps work pretty well. however, for whatever reason the app on my iphone crashes every time i login the first time. it gives me an error saying critical error please sign out. most the time when i sign back it, it’s ok after that. but usually requires restarting the app.
fix crash. my quickbooks app was crashing on my ipad 3, after i did the upgrade. press and hold the app icon and uninstall it. then, download it again. it now works.
playback publishing. good accounting app
easy invoice creation. high quality invoices can be created on the fly with my iphone!
wonderful app!!!. couldn't sing the praises high enough. i run a small, single member managed llc and the quickbooks online app is everything i need. i can create and send invoices and sales receipts on the go, even have the customer sign right on my iphone or ipad.
makes life easier!. helps me keep record of everything from invoices, payments customers and expenses. all from my phone
. so many times it's hard to save invoices, cause frustration, i'm sorry tanks
should of bought it ages ago. such an easy to use app and system, back up support were quick precise and friendly. well done quick books
pretty good!!. just started my business and so far liking what i’m seeing. the app is pretty neat.
garbage!. they update the app and completely remove support for ios 8! i understand making a newer version only compatible with newer ios, but why block legacy users all together? it worked great on ios 8 before, now the same version of the app suddenly says i need to upgrade! i pay $30month for this garbage!?
wonderful app!!!. couldn't sing the praises high enough. i run a small, single member managed llc and the quickbooks online app is everything i need. i can create and send invoices and sales receipts on the go, even have the customer sign right on my iphone or ipad.
not very useful. i find this app useless for what i need on the go. i want the balance in my checking account so i know how much money i have. i would like to create and edit a sales receipt and can't do that. i never use this but wish i could.
. crashes often
credit note cis. you cannot issue a matching credit note for an invoice with cis deduction, despite speaking to qb for over 2 hours they admitted they dont know how to do it.
never stays connected. i’m being very generous by giving three stars but every time i use this app, it disconnects from my bank. i have to always use my macbook to sync bank data and keep qb up to date. when it finally syncs, this app rocks and that’s why i’m giving three stars. i want to love it, but please fix the syncing issues.
. fantastic, easy to use software. i own two small businesses and quickbooks has made my life a lot easier. with the app i can use it anywhere, which is a nice bonus. highly recommend it!
won't print invoice with signature from my device. if i could i would give it five stars.. great app
looks excellent, just too complicated for me. i've been testing various apps that would suit my small businessfreelance needs. the app is limited which forces you to the website for certain deletions, updates etc. i also had difficulty navigating. i've since switched to freshbooks which was easy for me to figure out.
love it. i've used many online accounting platforms and this is far the best. the app is amazing.
great app. works very well with the ipad. allows you to make invoices and notes on the go. much better being cloud based than pc based. it costs more but it definitely worth it when it comes to the convenience.
so helpful. my business is basically my husband and me. when we are both out of the office, it's been difficult to have to wait to help customers. this app has allowed me to to create an invoice from an estimate, accept payment and send a receipt all from the truck!
quick books online is awesome. this app and online software allows you to send estimates that customers can approve electronically then after its approved and the work is done the same estimate transitions into an invoice at the push of a button. after the customer pays, that information can be easily stored for tax purposes. awesome!
great tool for self employed small business owners. easy to use and easy to navigate
. this app does so much for our new business!):
. great app
dan boulton. great bit of kit, works on desktops (chrome a must) and ipads. great to tap into the companies account anywhere, any places. a few problems from the start , but we are flying now. great value for money for both new and old business.
error. the jan 2019 update is plagued with logon issues. i have logged out and deleted the app and then loaded it again on my phone to start fresh. even this does not fix the issue. no matter what, i get a message about critical updates being needed and it logs me out and crashes at each startup.
reduced feature set. previous version:the feature set of the web based app is not matched. (previous mentioned currency and time records). update: removed a lot of preexisting functionality and did not add any missing functions. much worse than before. cannot find a list of invoices due to a supplier. clicking on a particular supplier brings up only the address particulars.
. brilliant app filled with bugs. trying to email invoices and get endless waiting screen. try and update contact details and it cant upload the details. sort it out or im off as im sure most others will be.
latest update is garbage. app has been great up until 3 weeks ago now it no longer works! crashes every time i try to open the app.
crashes when downloading. crashes when downloading after initial setup. have not been able to use app. disappointing.
useless. i am an avid qbo for ie customer for many years, but this ipad app is useless. can't do anything with it, and can not see banking info, the most important thing in accounting! if you want to view customervendor names that can be done, but you can't work in this app. view only.
horrible. do not waste your time or money. after a while they hold your money and cause a ton of financial difficulties for companies who rely on getting paid. there customer service is bs..........do not use
good app. helps me run my business in paperless mode. crashes when i push terms while creating invoice or estimate. please fix this.
incredible. this is an incredible application. if you're looking to intuitively streamline your business this is definitely the app for you!
bugs. after updated ios 13, it’s not working. please fix the bugs.
great way to keep up with small business book keeping. in previous years, with my software based quickbooks, i ended up doing most of my neglected books once a year for tax times. with this i do an update on a daily bases and will have do just a little detailing come years end.
poor service. difficult to set up invoice template and negotiate site, customer service poor, and when you try to write a review and send it off if the nickname is taken you have to write it all out again. as usual well advertised on tv but fails to deliver.
phone app fail. what ever opinion you have of qbo ... the phone app fails. it will not let you see the estimates and invoices for a customer. they exist, in your system but they do not show up in the app. everything else.... any other feature discussion... it's all irrelevant. if you can't view basic customer info, the app fails.
. error message when i try to log in on my tablet. customer service offers little assistance after a long time on hold. this experience makes accounting for my small business even more unbearable. (update 11418): i dropped the review down to one star (from 2) because the error message is yet to be resolved on my tablet, three months later, and qb has increased the cost of their simple start plan by 30%. lame.
. excellent app need to improve speed only.
need packing slip option. add the option to send packing slips from the mobile app
app crashes. this app crashes or cannot save my data on every entry i make. horrible app!!
. great app, very ready to track income and expenses. making and tracking invoices is so easy even easier then on the computer, reports and everything is really easy to access and track.
good. love this app
worst customer support ever. worst customer support in history. using their software and need cs is the best ticket to drive you out of business.
. think it is great to a point. having trouble posting a sales receipt. can't get to my comp. wanting and needing more.
love this product. i've been using qb for years. every year it get better than the year before. i won't use any other accounting software.
. good apps
. love the app! it makes my job so much easier!
. wonderful excellent program. does wonderful for my small business
couldn't run my small biz without qb. have used for 4 years. always learning new things. have a great customer service  support. very user friendly for us biz owners who don't have a background in billing  payroll.
. great app and can finally look at my invoices on the job.
great app. use it while in the field working on my samsung galaxy tab pro 10.1 don't even need to break out the laptop!!
. quickbooks technical support is very bad and technical support dont know about how to customised form of bill and showing in their theam but donot show in my bill how to solve it thay don't know ..... and my network speed is 5mbps but opening quick books need time 10  20 minutes to open ... i don't recommend any one for supscription or purchase .... this is a overall very slow software
. the app is as easy to use as the desktop online version.
haven't enjoyed quickbooks online. several bugs. customers having trouble paying online. was told to have them use a different browser. really? drop down menus recently stopped working.
functions missing. works well enough but when receiving payments it doesn't allow you to pick the bank account. frequent problems with it locking up as well
so far. i like the app, the only problem is i can't add my income i can't figure out how on my android please help, so i can give it 5 stars
fix finally now i can get back to work.. this version fixed the errors from the last update. glad it working again. quickbooks has been good except the last update. this one fixed the issue. we us this app for our onsite business and it's great. several times i would send an invoice to the customer when i'm leaving their home and before i get to the next job it's already paid. update. does not work again. :(
when it works it’s great. this app will not recognize my credentials even as i use the online version. i wish it were reliable and i was able to use it consistently. even reinstalling the app does not fix the problem. intuit needs to focus on making this app work on a regular basis as you pay for this service.
gary stanton. this app means i can seem to know what i am doing, it actually works for me.
. invoicing only works when it feels like. app is very hard to navigate. half the tools i have to log in to my computer and do on the desktop version. very dissatisfied and will be cancelling this service soon as i find a better alternative.
". i have got a problem to add my bank details. the website doesn't work, after i chose ""i agree"" (under my bank description of using). please sort it out asap."
absolutely amazing. there is no better accounting software on the market, for any size business, than quickbooks! such a powerful tool for such a low price and the qb team are always hard at work making it better.
. worst app ever. at best there is a 30 second lag when opening the app, at worst it freezes my phone up and i have to restart the whole phone. the app doesn't display most of my customer transactions. awful, ill be finding a new cloud based accounting service.
quick and easy to use. so much quicker and easier to use then getting on the computer!
easy. it could be a little bit easy to use.... invoices could be customized to add options like hours....
bugs and bugs it a jungle. need to be able to email multiple emails at one time.
underdeveloped & terrible support. the software is totally undeveloped and does not have the features of the regular desktop version. tech support is horrific, they can't help because they don't have the knowledge. intuit had no business releasing the software to the public it's not even ready for beta yet. the iphone app is worthless!
"awful app... can't even sign in. migrating to qb online so thought app would be great.. wrong! app won't sign in and reports 'communications error' in addition, it's not compatible with my 8"" tablet running android 5x  come on intuit  sort it out"
good to have. this app is wonderful to have. you have everything you need while on the go.
great. this app helps my small business tremendously. very easy to navigate, enter and retrieve data. very affordable.
signature issues. the app crashes every time i get a signature or it doesn't save the signature. please resolve this issue
great app. convenient, reliable. constantly being improved. keep up the good work!
. easy to use. love the app, but i keep getting a message that my user role is unsupported so i can't do anything.
. does what it says on the tin
does not update. i post payments and the sustem still shows full amount due. also will not log in from phone after dozen attempts and entering codes from qb
great!. this app for quick books is fantastic! works just as it's supposed to! thanks!
awesome app!. makes keeping up with my business' cashflow situation from anywhere in the world a breeze!
good app. app does what it says it will do!
love it. customers are paying online. so much easier for my business. great app.
seabreeze sealants. awesome app, makes running our business quick & easy in all aspects, we are able to stay in control of cash flow and invoices. highly recommend 👌🤙
tiene errores. en las últimas transacciones tiene errores no carga las últimas
. creo que es ineficaz ya que e recibido mi pago i no puedo ver la información de mi talón de pagos i ninguno de los representantes que me an asistido a podido brindarme información para poder obtener la información que necesito por lo general cuando una compañía te paga tan bien te proporciona el talón de pago
great ui and mobile to desktop experience. i just started using quickbooks about two months ago and i don't know what i would do without it now. it's simple, easy to run a freelance business with. it's helped me become a freelance business and get paid which is the most important part :)
disaster. was forced to use qb online due to always changing fees for desktop version. always crashes. hard to use. terrible. wish i could use another program.
highly recommend for startups. qbo does everything that i need it to. it is a great dashboard to see where i am at, with the ability to add details to all of my transactions.
convenient, convenient, convenient!. as a small contractor always on the go this app is great with easy access to all my info. only downfall is lack of progress billing from an invoice, but i have found a work around.
worse and worse with every update.. the more recent the update, the worse this app runs. worked great until they changed to a new platform and now it's slower then ever. to logging in or saving pictures out in the field, it takes an additional 20 mins on the job site just waiting for quickbooks.
it worked good until it didn't. i can't even login it says app closed
sloooooooowwwww!!! iphone 6. very slow to do simple things like log an expense. camera feature is useless with crop feature. can i have the option to turn this off? just wanna take a photo without auto crop which 90% does a bad job. other than that its great :)
time expense and mileage. great product. inconsistent functionality across desktop, iphone and ipad. for us professional service peeps can we have time expense and mileage please!
longtime quickbooks user. always pleased with the updates. best program i've used. very user friendly
often worthless. when the system works it can be great. however, i’m in day 3 of not being able to get bank accounts to update.
app is great for any business. i have a small business and this application is awesome. especially if you have a mobile business. this make like so much easier for your customer to pay online. inventory management is very easy to use and update
great!. continues to impress and improve on this very useful app. i use it daily for bids, invoices and expenses. the addition of the ability to record expenses and photograph receipts has made my life so much more easy. and to be able to quickly add clients, easy estimates and quick invoices and finally receive payments is unbelievable and wonderful.
outstanding. very user friendly app. like nothing you have seen in accounting. the future is here.
i need this app. i really need to use this app. but everytime i try to create an account it says connection error. i have been sending multiple emails about the same for the past month and no reply. five stars if you fix this problem
great app!. only change would be to allow for a larger job location field. other than that i can honestly say it's helped us tremendously with invoicing.
not useful at all. this app was written by someone who does not understand quickbooks and its purpose. get back to basics please if this is to be used by us.
the worst app ever. this app is the worst app i have ever used. takes too long to update data .... and sync hardly ever works... does not have overview screen where it shows balances on accounts... no option to sort list differently... showing the oldest payments, open invoices on top... no option to change sorting methods... too many things to list...
review this, quickbooks. i was using the app on my ipad, and kept getting a notice to ‘submit a review’. only choice was ‘ not now ‘ . after every transaction, after every page change, the message came up to ‘submit a review’ i pay a monthly subscription, stop bugging me. here’s your review.
quick easy to use.. always there at my fingertips. love it ..use it....my business is now updated and current. .!!!! couldn't live without it.
awesome. i love how simple it is to create an invoice on the go. this app is definitely essential for any small business owner.
what happened?. this app used to work perfectly. after the last update i can't use it how i used too. if they do not fix it soon i am going to have to look into other options
. more user friendly and flexible than sage
greatest app and programming. i’ve been using quickbooks online for the hess say at least eight years and before that i was using the books software on my computer and either way quickbooks has been great except my business structure strong and you always let me know what payments were paid and what is not. so thanks a lot for having such a great application and program and i hope you keep going in improving every day
gst number option not available. add gst number option in the app. have to visit the browser and then update gst
. love it, used quickbooks 2013 before this and so far i like the features this has better seems easier to use
super efficient. this app has streamlined my workflow 100%
. more nicer with the update but i still can't give my customers discounts, i wish it would let me make a negative quantity or rate while making and invoice.
"locks, freezes, and won't sync. updated last week and haven't been able to use it since. i've reinstalled, cleared cache, resynced data... nothing. qb customer service ""can't see any issues with my login"" so who knows ? ive been reduced to entering all my invoices from my computer at home (defeats the purpose of the app doesn't it?). until they fix this update, don't download it."
. app crashs more then i can use it nearly impossible to get my work done will definitely be looking in to other ways t invoice and accept payments
. it's an amazing app, very helpful and fast responsive
slow to load and outdated info. the mobile app is pretty much useless, continues to give outdated balances, the only report available is a basic p&l. i need to see a running balance, not just the bottom line which is usually wrong but no way to check! i see many updates but no improvements, only rate increases!
". terrible customer service, took my money for a monthly subscription, then did not activate my subscription and now after 3 days of 10 pm3 am ""customer service"" messages, resulting in absolutely nothing, richie more or less told me i'm screwed and intuit, inc is keeping my money and that i can try to get a refund from google for my intuit subscription. poor business. if anyone wants to actually see what richie says, message me and i'll forward conversations."
excellent update!. thanks very much for the update, all my recent activity imported and the reports are very much welcomed! this has definitely made me happy. cheers!
pro advisor. the training videos and exam are not opening on my ipad. apparently doesn’t work with safari. i have tried everything possible in my settings.
down graded. i down graded to qb online. it appears it was released about a year too soon. nothing but frustration from day one. the phone app is all but useless.
newest update is nothing but problems. can no longer update estimates. freezes and have to close app. also cannot see new estimates fellow employees have created. app ran perfectly prior to the update. intuit needs to launch new update asap or they are losing my business.
unable to login via iphoneipad. every time i try and login from my iphone or ipad it tells me no account associated with the given information. but when i login via a web browser with the exact same information i have no problem. basically defeating the purpose of the app. fix asap please
entering bills?????. why have intuit decided not to support bill entering on this app?!? it great i can import my paper receipts using the camera, but whats the point if i can't enter as a bill only an expense?!?
not user friendly. it’s hard to fill all boxes as do on pc. not user friendly. it’s hard to fill all boxes as do on pc.
. the best accounting app for beginners
. good app and easy to use.
. app is nice but it stops automatically some times
. i found it absolutely amazing, my team are starting to use it and they love it. reduced our time to monitor our income by a whopping 75%! we have also downloaded it into our tablets, iphones and can view and monitor and action it online and on the go, glad i bought the app!
receipt killer. using primarily to log receipts with snapshots and it's invaluable for that. no longer storing piles of receipts to head to the scanner. i can capture and log daily while drinking morning coffee.
incomplete. well laid out and functional. without banking though it's not as useful as i'd like.
easy to navigate. mobile freedom. makes it super easy to stay on top of business while always on the go.
don’t update!. so many bugs. a bunch of features have changed for the worse! running on ipad pro 11” ios 13.1.2
terrible. so many problems i don’t even know where to start. i transferred my desktop version to online with the last year and half reconciled. i know have to go back and reconcile again. also  it keeps crashing. there are good things about it but overall not so happy with the software.
great app for small business. only problem i see is cannot link to pc and print balance sheet
great app. loving it  i love keeping track of expenses on the go.
super & excellent apps. very user friendly application . i would recommend this software to other people
. needs to be updated equivalent to iphone app just switched to an android phone from an iphone. the iphone version was just updated with more features. this app needs to be updated as well. looking forward to the next release.
the recent update fixed the problems!. this app seems to be back to normal! 😄 qb online works great for working on the field and being mobile! 😊
great app. user friendly. simple and intuitive!
brutal support and comparability. currently looking for another accounting solution. the intentional limitations and total lack of cooperation with the support team leads me to the opinion that all positive reviews are fake. epic fail intuit.
not useful yet. it is okay to check open balances and receive payments, but other than that, there is little functionality. qboa continues to improve, so i expect this app will improve as well.
great app  not all features. great app. need to be able to cut purchase orders while on the road . . . not there yet.
really enjoy this.. so happy to switch over to qb online, from the pc version. easy to set up, runs smooth and quickly, and like that i can access from any device.
. hi team kindly add digital signature...only this 1 thing is missing in this app...overall best experience with you
would be great if…. this app would really be a great app if it woukd have all the functions as on the pc. for exsample i wanted to issue an invoice with a different currency, and the app blocked it and sent me to the pc. so for what is this app good if we have to go to the pc for almost each transaction?
handy for sole trader. some things aren’t available on the app, like editing your invoices.
ios 13 incompatible. was using this app, working fine on my ipad with ios 12 but updated phone to ios 13 and will not load app but crashes every time i open it. i’m not paying for a dud app. fix it or refund my subscription.
. the only thing it does is say my account doesn't include mobile app use, i try to log in from the browser and it shows the same message....so much for trying to give you money, i'm off to look for something that'll help me keep track of my business and let me log in.
touch id rules. much easier to login now.
". signed up, gave cc info, created account, password etc. system then froze, gave me no confirmations and started billing me. spoke with the ""chat help"" which is people who can't spell common words or understand english. they were unable to cancel my account. now i have to through mastercard to get my money back. thank god my business is not dependent on this ancient software."
ok but frustrating. doesn't do as much as online version. lots of error messages when downloading bank data. poor customer service, not responsive when errors flagged.
. very user friendly great app great technical support i recommend it to anyone
. freezes often and takes ages to recover
. great for business. keeps track of all your records. would defiantly recommend the app to everyone.
game changer. been using the desktop version for over a decade. now that i’m using qbo along with the mobile app i feel like i have been living in the dark ages! this is simple, useful, powerful and most importantly convenient! no more keeping up with paper receipts and forgetting to keep track of purchases.
. app won't download sticks at 64% :
refresh invoice?!?. trying to add new items to existing invoice with partial payment received and won't let me save changes! refresh invoice means what, exactly? without this function why do i need my subscription? made office work harder as now must go submit through pc and pray that works...
. garbage. been with qbo for 4 years. app is impossible to use now more than ever
awesome! a must for small business.. may seem a tiny overwhelming at first. just stick to it and you'll learn to love it! so simple once you get the hang of things ;)
please fix. 1. when creating an estimate or invoice you can not add the project location. 2. also i have an item for notes on my estimates which should not show any price numbers (0.00) 3.i can not edit the way estimates  invoices look. i try it in android and apple both apps have the same problem. if you fix that the app will be perfect.
great app. let's me keep up with things while i am on the go.
crashes. this app fails all the time, i keep having to reinstall to log in.
great functionality on finger tips. very handy app. looking for the timesheet option to be added as well.
new version stinks. one of the main reasons i use the app is so that i can pull up my customers entire transaction history when i'm out in the field. the previous version did that beautifully. other problems as well.
brilliant!. after years of using outdated and under performing sage software, finally i can use a truly mobile cloud based app that fulfils all the needs of a small business. come change of tax year make the switch, it's easy and you will wish you had done it years ago.
decent. not as full featured as website
". mobile app is full of bugs, recent ""update"" has now made it so my account is unable to sync and wont let me log in. not very useful for my mobile business. tried reinstalling the app, still no luck."
crashes now. i used to love it. i got a new iphone updated it and installed quickbooks and it crashes every time i sign in. it says i have to download my company info every time i open the app. it takes 510 minutes to do so. i have contacted customer support multiple times. every time they tell me there should be an update soon and it will be fixed soon. it never changes.
gets the job done!. i can make transaction entries on the move. i really enjoy this app.
owner. thank you for qbo! it's a breeze to use and i love recommending it to my clients! can't wait to get updates and see what else qbo can do.
ios 13 incompatible. was using this app, working fine on my ipad with ios 12 but updated phone to ios 13 and will not load app but crashes every time i open it. i’m not paying for a dud app. fix it or refund my subscription.
. great app
great but could use a little more. overall pretty great. clean easy to do basic tasks, would love access to a few more advanced features...but overall it's a great app. the app is stable, love the fingerpint login (even though it's still a little buggy at time of writing the review), it's clean & easy to read, good navigation. overall i'm very happy with it!
. it's a great app but needs to simplify some processes.
. keeps crashing on my note 9 cant access the app
. use qb for all my book keeping, estimates and invoices.
. i use this app for my small business, and it's fantastic everything i need and then some. all in an affordable package,and it's simple to use also.
great app. excellent service and addition to the qb online software
bookkeepers or better only! too much info available to users.. this app would allow a salesman taking orders to view way too much information. it's nice that it integrates with the qbo program, but what am i supposed to do about salesmen that only need to check inventory and write orders? surely they should be excluded from the company books! very disappointed in the time i wasted talking to intuit salespeople who materially misrepresent the functionality of the program
. best value accounting app hands down
powerful mobile app!. love this app and use it all the time while on the go.
i love it!. best app to use if you are constantly on the go.
. i love it invoice right on the job
great app. just started to use. easy to navigate. have had no issues.
. so easy to use and navigate
so so. hard to understand how to do a lot of things, and frustrating at times. customer service though is very good, i just wish i had more time to work with them.
error when logging in. my first time logging in and it just say there was a error. i send the error log via mail. waiting...
limited features. good app but still too many features missing that require logging in to the website. e.g. vat and paying salaries as expenses.
very helpful. would love that they add a feature for partially paid invoices
needs more functionality. time tracking capabilities are missing which make this unusable for me, forcing me to use the online version which defeats the purpose of this app. it doesn't really make sense to release an ios version that can only do a portion of the tasks.
great for mobile services. i'm a computer technician and i use this to send a invoice or estimate for clients. quickbooks has a brand name which is good when you email your clients a invoice, it looks very professional. the best thing about this app is the cloud base syncing of your invoice, clients, income and expenses. it's worth the money if you want good quality invoices for your clients.
not good . the iphone version is so trimmed down its not usable i can't get a usable who owes me money so many things i'd say no
not even close to online or desktop versions. at the cost of not wanting to hire a secretary my consultant had me switch to online version from desktop, it sucks! used to update q.b. desktop every 3 yrs (when forced to) for $150 and now pay around $400 a year for less function. the direct qb online site is better from my mobile device than the actual app. the options between app and website dont function the same. terrible!
. makes bookwork super easy on the go, and new features keep being added to app to make it a better desktop companion
. great app great aap for my business for all my on the go needs....lacks some features but worth it
great for contractors. on the go app that helps with contracts and invoices . i can use ipad or even phone to show my clients and get approval and signature for new contracts . just what i was looking for
vino. great app very professional invoices from the computer
terriblw. the sync between the data entered on the desktop and data entered in the mobile app is terrible.. half of the time it doesn't work
great app but .... i use this app frequently while i’m not at my computer but am disappointed that i can’t access my suppliers & update supplier bills etc, will you be able to add this feature?
. have not upgraded since 2006, this app is great. i am not tied to the office for alot of tasks that used to only be done in the evening.
. horrible
pretty amazing. i hate accounting, but i have to say that this is the best yet, by a lot. once you're setup if you log every purchase and deposit on your phone, it does itself. quickbooks pulls up your checking account, matches your entries to the banks and you're done. i'm really glad i signed up for the online version. it rocks
easy for newbie. started out with the desktop version of qb and migrated to the qbo platform. so much better for me and easy to use now. i can send a quote from my phone and then invoice once the job is complete which for a lazy guy like me keeps me on tasks done billing times quicker. highly recommended
great app!!. this is a fine app, help me to run my business on the go.
easy to use. great system, much cheaper than other accounting systems, user friendly and plenty of help if you do get stuck. definitely 5 star
buen contador. tiene muchas herramientas para hacer toda tu contabilidad.
mileage tracker not working.. so far quickbooks support has not been able to get the mileage tracking feature to work on my phone. iphone6. won’t manually of automatically track mileage and wb support has not resolved or explained why. partial functionality is not good enough!
quickbooks . . . not so quick.. would like company info on the invoices to be able to email or snail mail them. would also like to be able to change some of the categories in the invoices. not very user friendly.
ok but struggles on ipad pro. what the app does it does well but it doesn’t do payroll as well as some other features. logging in to the website on my ipad pro isn’t much better.
great app. this app has helped me out tremendously. i have a bad habit of loosing paperwork in this cut that out 100%
not impressed with this software. i am not able to add my bank account.
i love it.. i run three business on it. 1. multispecialty physician group. 2. mechanical electrical & plumbing 3. physician sales & service. i complete my payroll and carry out all accounting functions here.
great!!!. super app and awesome program for small businesses. we have only been in business for a little over a year now but we really could not have done it without qbo! love everything about quickbooks! thank you for being part of a successful first year and many years to come.... america spa and pools, llc
really convenient to use. you can use any mobile device to create invoice and doing expense! really use to use and user friendly!
touch id fail. please stop making us enter a password everyday. every other app that uses touch id doesn't have this issue. thumbs down qb 👎🏼
disappointing. i've been a longtime user of the desktop version of quickbooks for the past 20 years and just recently switched to quickbooks online. i was really looking forward to managing my company's expenses, print checks, and enter bills from my new ipad. i am terribly disappointed in the complete lack of features available in this app. it's actually completely useless and a waste of memory. how could intuit release such a piece of garbage such as this?
no pdf attachment. 3 stars as the app only able to upload photo of the invoice, not other format. you need to understand that pdf is much small in size and more practical for mobile upload. as for photo, it is at least 3m nowadays and it took almost 1 min or 2 to finish the upload.please look into it in next upgrade
mgrm. great app
easy. it could be a little bit easy to use.... invoices could be customized to add options like hours....
. app takes forever to load on my one plus 5t. will not load banking feed to organize payment catagories. man, for how much we pay for this service, you would think it would have a rocking app....
easy here, hard there. you can tell this is more for business that need to create invoices more than purchase orders. desktop as well. i’ll give 4 stars when they add a po feature to the app.
. this app is eady to use and keep all my business expenses in one place!
. great app helps my accounts team so well
hit or miss. when it works it is awesome, however it's been rare that it works. 9 out of 10 times i get an error has occurred message and i have to use the desktop to resolve it.
almost useless. the app is good for sending invoices only. don't expect to be able to do any other business on the app. the mobile site is about as good as healthcare.gov. you can look at some things but forget everything else. again good for sending invoices only. i expected more from a established company.
invaluable. i am a mobile mechanic and use quickbooks on my journeys to write invoices, receipts and estimates. i wouldn't be without it
slow to load and outdated info. the mobile app is pretty much useless, continues to give outdated balances, the only report available is a basic p&l. i need to see a running balance, not just the bottom line which is usually wrong but no way to check! i see many updates but no improvements, only rate increases!
. love how easy it is to stay in track. easy to use and send invoices to my clients.
easy to use. quickbooks is great for anyone especially if you like to do your books on the move
. love the app..easy and user friendly
"awesome apptool. although i rate it 5 star, there's much improvement that can be made on creating ""invoices"" definitely needs more options and versatility. needs more custom ability in modifying the invoice into something fitting to each customer. overall, keep up the great work and adding new custom features."
utter crap. if i could give no stars i would app crashes all the time won't send invoices to customers i have had for years have been struggling on with quickbooks for several years but now can't take the frustration anymore caused by this utter waste of money.
"works well for me and my needs. i am not a ""power user"" i don't run a multibillion dollar business. this program does more than i can hope to need or use. it is clean and clearly laid out. it does all that i need, and am likely to need, for the foreseeable future. i am very happy with this product."
limited and buggy. there are too many features not included to make the app any use.
like. loving the app!! thank you!!
quick books. this is very easy to use and it's great. with my iphone, ipad and mac, it updates any changes made and works great. thanks it is made invoicing easy
update problems. the app have now problems i recommend to check that i was using the app for 3 years but now is a disaster
amazing. amazing app
. ok. new version is better, but still lacks supplier feature. good for easy transaction...have to use web for more complicated stuff. good app! no complaints other that it obviously ment for the simpler side of the accounting management equation. good design, have high hopes for more features in the future.
can't do much. you can't pay bills, enter bills, or do almost anything that i do on a daily basis on my computer. the app is nice looking but useless for anything i need to do besides check my balance.
can someblet tell me where are my products ???. trying to do a new invoice but can’t see my products once i hit the + bottom
terrible app...... terrible app it does not work. since last update👿
app problems. app keeps crashing haven’t been able to create invoices for days
great app. works well
easy to learn. easy to learn good support. i would like to be able to upload invoices sitting in my iphone pdf or ibooks app, or even better, directly from my email attachments, into the qb app when i am entering expenses. currently i only have the option of entering a photo. best wishes, dee
great app. for my business is been really helpful app. i'm a painter contractor, check job all day, if i need to send estimates and invoices now i can do it on the road.
like it so far!. at this point i have only used the free trial version of this app. i like it. i do wish that it was linkable to my bank account or at least had a register like the software version i have used in the past but i am still going to buy the full version.
glitchy. only problem is if you’re doing a live estimate or invoice, if your screen goes idle this app makes you log in again and you lose all the information you’ve typed in. super annoying especially when you’re measuring out a house or doing a walk through with a client and entering information as you go.
great can scan bills directly with phone. i use phone app instead of pc sometimes, as i can record bill right when i make purchase, complete with scan on receipt. awesome.
not bad needs a little work. online is getting better with each update. still needs more options with mobile and ipad. one for sure needs to have bank account option on payment received
quickbooks. very good app i will purchase after my trial thanks
poor. slow, clumsy. there are far better apps on the market. don't waste your money.
. great app
works good. easy to use.. it's really easy to file expenses with this. that's all i really need a mobile accounting app for.
zero stars. another worthless update. now you have to login every freakin time i set my phone down and of course invoicing a customer with a credit still doesn't synchronize correctly and has never. if you're looking for an accounting system please shop around before getting tangled up in this company. i've been waiting for that call from tech support for 5 years lololol. why do you keep trying to fix what isn't broken. 21517 latest updates are a constant crash.
ipad in the name?. really. can't use with mac? get out of apple app store. waste of time 😒😑
awesome for small business. couple problems creating invoices from phone.
great software all round. quickbooks is easy to use and manage. software and app work easily together. makes small businesses life simpler. love being able to use app to do expenses and invoicing on the go.
. very much useful app
improving but still a long way to go. like the new dashboard, but need ability to set ytd totals, more report options, does not show all my bank accounts. needs to be more customizable. app does not replace the website version, which is still needed to do any real work. best feature is the easy way it handles the bank feeds.
. brilliant app for small business owners
love this app. awesome
. it's a great app for a small business.
qb online. this software is good but lacks shelf assessment options and the price is slowly getting to much per month. currently just gone up to £21.50month so time to look for a cheaper sole trader option
lacks features that is available online. i couldn't even adjust my personal profile. after customer service told me to get online and do it they still couldn't get me in it. they told me to request a refund on here. i emailed you for the refund. please refund
. my business depends on qb and thankfully the web portal works. on my samsung s8 however, all this app does is give me an unresponsive black screen if i'm lucky enough to even load a login screen. not compatible with samsung s8 apparently. this app is trash. stick to the web portal and save yourselves the aggravation.
really useful app.. but it would really be so useful if you could print sales receipts directly or even indirectly export as pdf to print on the go via a bluetooth receipt printer.
underdeveloped & terrible support. the software is totally undeveloped and does not have the features of the regular desktop version. tech support is horrific, they can't help because they don't have the knowledge. intuit had no business releasing the software to the public it's not even ready for beta yet. the iphone app is worthless!
. love the mobile app. it's quicker to enter in info than the desktop , especially when your on the go. i just love that feature.
a j rooter. it's an easy program to use makes life a lot less aggravating when you can do your work on the road
great app. great app
. po , translation invoice, how to add discount?
projectivity. great app for my consulting business. once you enter your data quick books can show you a picture of what your business looks like; where your money is coming in by customer. instantly produces reports, reminds you if you have invoices overdue and can be linked to your bank. what more would a small business want? i love this bookkeeping program. :)
app is handy, but buggy. recurring invoices are a wreck. i have had the same issue for 2 years with quickbooks resetting my settings every month and automatically sending invoices to my clients without approval.
itouch. itouch still doesn't work.
simple and easy. great for keeping tabs on your business on the go
ios 9. with the new os signatures on the iphone are no longer saved to invoices, instead the app just crashes. when people become dependent on specific features and then they stop working it leads to a lot of extra work. please fix this feature asap.
. works well and saves time, but still a few things that need to be done on the full browser version. would love to see integration with 3rd party mobile payment apps in the future.
. exceptional experience and great customer service.
very helpfu. great app. useful for keeping records even on the go. simplifies so much.
useless. i'm not even sure what the point of this app is. there's absolutely nothing you can do with it besides see what what you've already done on your desktop. the app does nothing to help you keep things moving along.
my music mi musica en espanol y english bilingual. bilingual
excellent for businesses in the go!. quickbooks is easy to use and the app allows me to create transactions, view balances and customer information wherever i am. i also love that i can take a photo of a receipt and categorize it on the go.
. really great app, highly recommend it!
not quite what i'm looking for. after the invoice2go update disaster, i read a lot of good things about this app. sadly it fell short of expectation as i was unable to change the invoice number, which i would think was a pretty basic requirement. advice on the internet seems to relate to an older version of the app as the information did not relate to what was on the screen. i won't be utilising my free trial, nor will i be subscribing.
. error message when i try to log in on my tablet. customer service offers little assistance after a long time on hold. this experience makes accounting for my small business even more unbearable. (update 11418): i dropped the review down to one star (from 2) because the error message is yet to be resolved on my tablet, three months later, and qb has increased the cost of their simple start plan by 30%. lame.
very convenient and up to date with technology. i love the ease of bookkeeping using this app. a perfect complement to my accounting software.
excellent. first class app don't know how i managed without it!
online version need improvement. the online version specially on ipad is very difficult to use. if the could make the ipad version like the desktop version gui it would help. the app is a little unstable because of the cookies and the background history that doesńt refresh the actual data timely. overall, it is a decent product they just need to make some tweaks.
. love the app. in the app we can schedule appointments. we need that feature for online with computer. can't be too hard to do.. thanks.
. the app sucks really bad, it's full of continuous bugs and it is unstable, every time you try to add attachments to expenses the app freezes does not save and shut down, find another solution because it's sad.
perfect for a small consulting firm. this app is everything i need for my consulting firm. easy to use and easy to keep track of expenses on the road. invoicing is a breeze. love the data in the cloud. take a pic and throw away those receipts! works flawlessly between my pc, mac, ipad and iphone. only gripe is the ipad & phone versions are not as similar as one would expect.
buggy. app has been very buggy. for a few months i lost the ability to add expenses and not every time i click on home the app closes. using brand new iphone 7.
. everything i need and so easy to use as a consultant. i invoice and make banking and purchase entries in real time, i no longer need to sit for long periods of time playing catch up.
same as other free app. wave does the same and it's free... once it's finish my period i am out.
crashing and signing out. hi there this app continuously crashes saying it needs crucial updates. there are no updates and continues to do the same over and over again. i cannot use it at all now. help.
unable to signin. since the update, qb won't authenticate on iphone 5s: either it states technical difficulties or the login info is incorrect. i'll uninstall and install to see if that resolves this new programming error.
glitchy. freezes regularly, can't send invoices quite often.
scammers. i was charged for 4 months and couldn’t even use my account. they don’t care someone please develop something better! $60 a month for absolute trash.
love it, i use it everyday for my business. qbo has helped my business grow buy looking professional, keeping up with invoices, and giving easy ways for the customer to pay.
. very easily can invoice on the go
. most of the times search for customers, invoice numbers, amount etc doesn't works. keeps on saying something went wrong!!! please get sortout this issue urgently.
not good. crashes often; slow; give frequent error messages.
great app!. works great on a samsung galaxy s5. features are coming along nicely. it would save a step to be able to add another expense from one just saved without having to back up from that record but no complaints otherwise.
keep crush !. my iphone version is ios11.2.1. i can’t open this app. keep crushing. please fix asap.
. love it! i'd love to learn more about how to fully utilize it but it's pretty simple to use. and that very key!
it's not working. it's not working in india for aondrid os .. useless app
great helpful app. i use sever times a week when on the go
. this app is a huge help. can't run my business without it.
very convenient!. this app has saved me on so many occasions. being able sending invoices and estimates onthego is awesome.
one in all. i can run my business with great confidence because of this application available of quickbooks online. one my favorite functions is the capability of producing estimates, and invoices immediately. that function pleases a majority of my professional field clients.
i can do all my stuff from my phone!. after working for a customer, i can type up some quick notes, have the customer sign off and take payment before i leave. exactly what i needed!
. great app and also great customer service they answer my questions very fast.
makes things sooo easy. can send invoices on the go. super easy. love it! total game changer!
great app love it !!!. makes my work so much easier
. makes it really easy to be on the move. i don't have to wait to invoice until i'm at my computer. i can do it right then and there
poor reporting. not very happy. only report is p and l and can't change from accrual to cash to see exact position. cannot see any nominals or account info disappointed
great. great app. love all the online offerings!
. app never up to date with website or it does not show you everything you can see online. sometimes you can't even see anyone's invoices or estimates. always an issue.
would get 5 stars if it refreshed properly.. every time i open the app, i need to log out then log back in in order to get updated content. please can this get fixed.
. excellent software!
nada funciona , nada de soporte y ningún tutorial. soy economista y sé cómo trabajar con aplicaciones y ordenadores . es una de las peores aplicaciones que conozco y si quiero saber cómo hacerlo no hay tutorías o quia que explica lo que quiero hacer . no la compres
incredibly glitchy. the app is glitchy despite updates. i’m not super impressed by intuit in general. i use their payroll for my business, a lot of glitches there too. app crashes or spontaneously exits my selections to “accept” for no reason and i have to start over. does not learn well, i have to reteach things over and over.
jimsop enterprises. it is good. it has provided a solution to my accounting problems
quickbooks. does everything i need it to do
. finally, this app is getting better! i have just quickly looked at it but the difference is very noticeable. goid things come to those that wait.
very limited in function. invoice list does not even list invoice #'s. how does junk like this pass qc?
keshav. it is a beautiful software. very flexible and user friendly. it made my work so simple. thanks to quick books!
agree with useless. not what i expected. does not have the same functions as qbo. disappointed! would have been great and convenient if all functions were available.
president. this app is great for small (mobile) business owners doing paperwork on the fly. it keeps office time to a minimum.
needs a lot of work. needs the ability to update bank accounts from the bank, as for now it only syncs with updates made on my windows or mac computers. needs access to all reports available. i had hoped this app would be a full version substitute when a laptop or desktop computer is not available.
app crashes on ios13.0 & 13.1. i’ve just updated the app and it’s still crashing on ios13.0 and also 13.1. i have tried to make contact with the developers via the support page but it also loads to blank pages after opening chat.
no supplier invoice. invoices from suppliers can not be captured on the app. you have to log onto the main website  which is extremely slow and cluttered to navigate on a mobile phone.
"bad idea. i downloaded to approve parole only to find i need a second app for that. two out of three ""recognized"" transactions are inaccurate. back to my mac for qb. ugly app guys. sorry..."
business owner. it's much easier than desktop version
now i can’t update banking feed.. all of a sudden i’m getting error 9999 when i tried to update banking feed.
pants app! does not refresh, to many glitches!. poor show on the app! creates more work for me then needed, stick to logging in online. far easier than trying to refresh the app manually, i'll get grey before i can do any accounting with this app!!
freezes. freezes when saving a new client. app is useless.
great app. easy to use
. good so far only on trial run right now
good app. very useful
need options to customize invoices. please add more options to customize invoices. i need to add secondary contact information such as name, address and phone, along with the regular billing address. also, i would like to modify the invoice number. otherwise, this app is great for field use with my ipad+cellular. it has saved me tons of time compared with working on my laptop and quickbooks desktop.
perfect for a small consulting firm. this app is everything i need for my consulting firm. easy to use and easy to keep track of expenses on the road. invoicing is a breeze. love the data in the cloud. take a pic and throw away those receipts! works flawlessly between my mac, ipad and iphone. no complaints whatsoever.
