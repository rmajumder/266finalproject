needs more features. i recently got an ipad. i really would love to use this app instead of having to go to the website through safari (which is horrible on the ipad). however, without custom reports, this app is very limited.
where is the payroll functionality?!?!. the app seems to intentionally not include payroll functionality, that’s what i need most! f-
saves time. transition good. works well. i hoped qb online would save time and allow us to stay current with renovation project costs and p&l. it has. transition from desktop to online went well. qb phone help was easy which had me running in a few days. all entry procedures are straight forward and more simple. i am starting to enter all expenses and invoices from my phone when receipts are fresh in my mind. 1q16 results were entered and up to date by 4/1/16 :)
updates to features needed. i am a subscriber. sad to say that the phone and ipad apps are useless. they do look pretty but have none of the functionality that is useful on the go or made me convert to quickbooks online in the first place: 1)you can't access bank data or enter transactions. 2)you can't record bills 3)you can't process the pay 4) you can't view invoices that have mileage or time put against them. 5) you can't enter timesheets.6) can't submit or edit tax data 7) no access to chart of accounts 8) can't see or edit employee data! but you can access useless features that are just gimmicky: use your fingerprint to log in. view profit loss because that's where you do your deepest analysis, which frustrates even more because you can't alter anything. common guys get those features in and i'll alter this to 5 stars!
broken app. latest update broke it. app will no longer launch and immediately crashes. now looking at alternatives.
missing deductions!!. the main reason i’d want to use the app is unfortunately not available in france- photographing any expense receipts i have and immediately entering in deductions when i make purchases. until this part of the app isn’t migrated over to the french version, the app is almost totally worthless to me. so bummed. however 3 stars because the app runs smoothly in what it does, even if you can really only enter sales and receive payments.
weak on the vendor side. okey app but needs some improvements. 1-easy to upgrade your your version and impossible to downgrade. 2- very weak on the billing and statement for vendors ( example when recording an expense, this app does not have the capability of recording the item count you spending for example ( 50 gallons of diesel * $3.25 = total) this app can't do this. very weak on the billing and statement for vendors that's why i gave 2 stars otherwise it would get 5* done
qbo app. luv the new dashboard!! excellent app. no complaints.
"not useable in multi-user environment. here we go again, another update and still no fix to locations and classes. intuit must be the worst software company on the planet. so in april intuit ""reaches out"" that a fix is on the way. that was 5 months ago! i stand behind my criticism. still a 1 star. what is wrong with intuit programmers? yup, yet again another update, and still not useable in multi-user. my business has more than 1 user account. locations and classes do not work in their accounts. how many years will this take to fix a bug that has been present since day 1? another update and i stand behind my previous review(s). seriously? another update, and still not multi-user friendly. but, oh boy, something works with apple watch. when will intuit fix the multi-user issues? someone else mentions they fix bugs. i can say the exact opposite - they leave bugs for years! i want to use and like this app. i've looked at every update since the very 1st version. it does seem to be slowly improving, but is still not useable for my company."
love it. i'm no doing anything super sophisticated but i love the app. easy to use to keep invoices and expenses current on the go!
great app. i have no complaints.
pretty good but, but no bill entry????. i have found this to be somewhat helpful for reviewing expenses, but it would be fantastic if i was able to pay bills on the go. i would love to be able to keep my business mobile by using the camera to “scan” invoices and submit them for payment right from the app. a core function that is surprisingly absent. this is a must for future development. without it, the app just come up short...
app crashes in ios9. this app was working great before the recent update. app just crashes when i try to open. i use an ipad 3rd gen running the latest version of ios9. please fix!!
great app. been with quickbooks for two years now and still really impressed very easy to use and works across all platforms would strongly recommend
stopped working. i used to get nice p&l reports on my dashboard. all those reports disappeared after latest iphonr update.
worked great until the latest update. i've really enjoyed having access to invoicing and to see how everything is doing right on my phone as i'm out about about taking care of business needs throughout the day. as of the last update, however, i seem to have lost the ability to see or send any new invoices or add customers. along with that, as of the update it is no longer allowing me to log in with touch id or pin, instead asking for a password every time. i loved the app until this latest update.
changed my business. this app has worked wonderfully. it fills the role of a second employee. accounting has never been so easy for both myself and for my clients to complete their bill.
perfect app for any small business owner. as a qbo pro advisor my opinion may be somewhat biased but i can not brag enough about the software, customer support and resources offered by quickbooks/intuit. qbo has allowed me to become a completely virtual bookkeeping firm, increasing my service area, customer satisfaction and turn around time. love love love them!!
superbe app!. je suis travailleur autonome. qbook me facilite la tâche (pour ma part, la comptabilité est un fardeau) dans le fait de garder un œil sur les chiffres de mon entreprise . je la recommande hautement! seul conseil: faites vous assister dès le début afin de configurer le plan comptable ; y mettre les chiffres exacts dès le depart. vous en serez ravis!
weak iphone app, no customer service. really weak app, no customer service. after trying to contact qb customer service, i got no response from anybody at qb. after paying big monthly fees $ i'm switching back to invoice2go, where i got great customer service and my feedbacks were used in improvements.
"new ""update"" totally crashes - it only gets worse!. i personally like the ipad app better than the online version for interface, but it has so many bugs! constantly gives me error message that i'm not authorized to do something (add/edit a customer, etc.), but then it lets me do it. but i keep having to close out all the error messages that pop up. often won't let me email an invoice. won't let me add customer off of creating a new estimate (have to add customer, close, then do estimate and choose customer again). the list of basic things that should not be an issue goes on and on. on the iphone app, there is no place for my reps to view the contact person's name at the company! i'm sure there are other things i could think of, but i've just learned to compensate and work around things. however an app with this many bugs should not be out there - it's pretty pathetic! update 11/18/15 - after update, all the previous bugs are still there. pathetic to issue an update and not fix what was wrong! update 1/14/16 - even worse! now i can no longer add an item to an estimate or see the customer name on estimates or invoices under ""activity"". what is wrong with you people? if you can't make it better, leave it alone! now it is completely useless! update 11/7/16 - i absolutely hate you for forcing me to upgrade to ios 9!!! i have been suffering with quickbooks ipad's pathetic bugs for well over a year. i am forced to use it for my job because my laptop is old and i hardly ever pull it out anymore. everything i do is on my ipad. however, i have an older model (not by years, but by model) and after the mess updating to ios 8.3 created for me, i vowed i would never update again! none of the other apps on my ipad have forced me to do this. app developers are generally sensitive to the fact that not everyone chooses to disrupt their life by updating their device and spending days having to learn to use it all over again (and deal with whatever new bugs it brings to the table). you must have the absolutely lowest level of developers out there who first, couldn't fix even simple bugs in your app (like telling me every time i set up a customer or did an estimate ""i wasn't authorized to do it"" and then warning me if i got out of it all data would be lost. but it wasn't and everything i did was still in the system. even our boss got this message and she is the administrator). there were a myriad of other quirks we had to work around and now your solution is to release a new version, but in so doing force everyone to upgrade to ios 9 because your developers weren't smart enough to know how to make it work with previous ios versions??? shame on you! you would get 0 stars in my review if i could and if this new version isn't totally bug free, you will really hear from me! 6/28/17 - so a month ago i finally successfully upgraded my ipad 2 to ios 9.3.5, which is the last version it will update to. i did this in order to be able to use qb on my ipad. it had its occasional crashes and freezes, as always, but otherwise was working ok until today. suddenly, total crash and won't open at all. i've uninstalled, hard reboot, and reinstalled several times to no avail. then checked the app store and see they did an ""update"" yesterday. typical. they just cannot seem to leave well enough alone. the thing has bugs and flaws enough, but they only seem to be able to make it worse, not better. it is unbelievable that a company like qb cannot hire a better technical support staff to develop their apps. my company is planning on switching to another software soon and i am so glad!"
low rating until the app supports chart of accounts. the app continues to be undeveloped for functions that are developed in the web interface. the app is excellent for invoices and credit card transactions if you have a merchant account coupled to your qbo account. the camera can be used in app to document your receipts to the cloud and i use it extensively for hotel/airfare/rental car expenses and they can be attached to invoices when emailing your customers.
good apps. its a excelent, but in 1 mounth are problem to connect in sometimes!! for all is good!
major problems with the newest update!!!. the app was working great until a few days ago. now i cannot receive payments on my iphone due to a bug in the app and i also cannot send an invoice via email on my iphone or ipad now. ☹️
great app for small business!. i love being able to enter my expenses and invoices from my phone. very convenient and makes tax time much easier!
only good thing is the price. it is a good value for the price, unfortunately that is about the only good thing about it. they need to set up some way to let you pay for the app from your company checking account instead of having to go thru an app store. they need to make the print function available on anything you are looking at. the need auto-fill on email addresses. this app could be so much better but they rarely upgrade it because they are the only game in town. i would switch to another companies app in a heartbeat if one ever becomes available.
mobile version. please make purchase order option available for mobile version. i can't send purchase order to vendors from the app
demoted from 5 stars to 4. using the app on ipad and iphone for more than 5 years. dashboard has been unable to properly show invoice status for at least 3 months now. version 17.9, at least 3 updates ago? no fix yet nor response from intuit after feedback. while i’m not fond of frequent updates, one expects to have these kinds of obvious bugs fixed in the next update.
app keeps crashing. keeps saying the session is over when i sign in and logs me out
excellent app. great app
amazing app!!. our business reconciliation just became simplified. easy to use and online access allows us to work on the go. highly recommend if you wish to save time.
so much support online... for other versions. i bought this product because their website showed all these articles to help you do this and that. after buying the product, i found none of the advice lines up with it (press the gear button...where exactly is that). then you realise that all the advice is for quickbooks online, and not for this ‘quickbooks accountancy’. yes there is an email questioning service, but you would think the advice would be available immediately. i have no desire of sending 30 emails as i try to grasp how to use this app.
it does have a fingerprint option. i haven't used the app enough, i use it mostly online with an imac, but since i use it mostly as a sales tool, and to give insurance, cpa, loan officers ect a quick recap of my sales vs investment/loss it's come in handy there. the fingerprint sensor always works for me in these situations but i'm a sole proprietor and i'm not sure if contractors/employees are given this option. i do everything on my imac online, even invoices, but i also keep a paper trail (hand written, i'm in the service industry). no ones used intuits e-mail payment option, but i hope to convince large customers and vendors to use it next year. i used the mobile app to make a few purchases classified as tools (loss) and use it to make sure square card reader scans go through before i update the invoice online. it's going to take time to learn the ins and outs of this app on mobile, but i do see it replacing 90% of mac/pc work in the future. till it can be all be done without a mac or pc my review remains 4 stars.
andrew. great system and good app. i have been using it for over 2 years now. however, there are some downsides which they couldn't rectify even after reporting them a few times. maybe i expect too much, but: you cannot upload pdf and sent it by app (eg. t&c to add to the quote), emails i sent to customers supposed to by coming to my inbox as well to keep track while sending quotes directly from the software, not happening anymore.. and some small loops while sending template msgs. but honestly, the best app and system for me so far.
electrical contracting business. very easy and convenient to use. my accountant can log on to it from her office saving me the time and the trip. i appreciate the phone app especially for unexpected service calls.
paying vendor bills within app is not ready for prime time. i’ve been using qb since 2005 and wanted to really like this app but it has too many bugs. using the app in the current form will lead to frustration and look forward to spending many hours on hold with tech support. the online version works best from a desktop. on an ipad or iphone, the app has problems paying vendor bills or in obtaining bank data. these problems also exist when using browsers like chrome, safari and firefox. not sure how widespread the banking problem is but by chance i was in a starbucks trying to sync bank data using a iphone and ipad and i gave up and as i was preparing to leave, i notice another person at the next table with the online version of qb open on her laptop. i asked if she was having issues. she was also have bank synchronization problems with her bank which was a different bank than mine. we were both on the phone with tech support at the same time for the same issue. tech support believes it’s a bank problem but the bank says it’s not them. she also was frustrated with the time spent on hold with tech support. stay with the desktop version for now.
great app to run my business. easy invoicing have app set up and operating in less then 30 min
cool app. very easy to use
brilliant. brilliant app. so happy that i've migrated over to quick books.
works well but maybe more than i really need. i have a ltd company on top of an employed job, so the company is just me and its small and i don't really need it to grow. my accountant recommended that i get quick books. it works well, does a good job of keeping track of income and expenditure and the invoicing of customers is very easy. compared to my old system in which i kept track of accounts using ms excel and then made a pdf invoice and emailed it to the customer, quickbooks is excellent, very quick and efficient. i do wish though that i could turn off some features. for instance, there are different types of income and expense, and it suggests that i have different kinds of banking / company credit cards, different business accounts. some of this is just confusing to me as it is labelled in technical jargon that i don't really understand, i wish i could just turn it off to being income, billable expenses and non billable expenses. the other problem i have is with the invoice numbers. if you forget to specify an invoice number it just defaults to the last one you made. that is maddening. i'd rather it just prompted me to fill the invoice number in. you can customise invoices from a template and that works well, customers tell me that they look clean, crisp and professional and they are easy to pay. expenses work well, you can create an expense item within an invoice and even attach a receipt or a phot o f a receipt to it, and then decide whether to include those attachments in the invoice sent to the customer. finally, it talks to my business bank account and so it tallies items in quickbooks with transactions in the bank, ensuring that both match and querying with you if they don't. in all i think its a really simple to use, great product that makes my small business finances a lot smoother than before, but i wish i could customise and simplify it a bit more.
need to improve!. the sole trader app is great for what i do including logging travel however i am registered for gst and therefore cannot use it. i have to go to the online version and just discovered you have to buy the plus version to link to recommended logbook app. qb you need to provide gst to the sole trader app or at the very least provide the same logbook function for the other qb packages.
not like the online version. the app is alright. missing a lot of feature (if you compare it to the online version) but if they come up with a solution and have them on the app version i would rate it 5 stars.
much room for improvement. if it were free, it's a great product , but as a paid program and app, it could use a good deal of user input towards improvement
impressed. i put off upgrading to online version after using quickbooks pro for five years, struggling to enter online direct debit expenses and payments. online version makes entering data easy and efficient. such a time saver for me. well done intuit! definitely worth the monthly subscription fee.
love using quickbooks!!. i love using it and it makes my business so easy and don't even need to carry my computer. i can actually do all of my invoices estimates anytime anywhere with my cell phone!
ties well to qbo. the app is very easy to use. you can adjust invoices easily and take payments within an invoice. it ties to quick books online very well. i wish it was easier to take payments outside of invoices, but i guess that's what the gopayment app is for. but that app doesn't automatically import the inventory items i'm tracking in qbo so there's no perfect solution.
could be much better.. this app needs lots of work. is not possible to assign an expense as billable. is also not possible to add markup from this app. lame.
disappointed. although it loaded up ok, it didn't refresh my data that i had added online. i emailed support who are supposed to reply in 24 hrs but never heard anything. so unless they get this sorted it's going to be deleted. update: june 24 2015. despite some good effort by the support desk it transpires that the current version does not support bills from third parties. i was advised to download the normal website version onto my device to get the functionality. so for the time being i have deleted the app.
business owner. this is a great product ! i don't know how i would keep my business organized without it. also customer services is awesome. this is a must have app!!!!
down graded. from april this app is unusable. i down graded to qb online. it appears it was released about a year too soon. nothing but frustration from day one. the ipad and iphone is useless.
great app. very easy to use voice to text is amazing can't believe i hadn't done this sooner.
functional with problems. the latest update took away the ability to choose territory in the app even though using a web browser does. i contacted intuit to report the problem. very nice but nothing has been done to fix it. also, common reports aren't available in the app.
priced higher than the performance. this app does a lot of things well. however, basic things like connecting accounts are a nightmare of inconsistency. i've spent the better part of an hour simply trying to connect checking accounts that are all at one bank in to my app. it worked one time and let me connect one of my six accounts on that connection but wouldn't let me do the others. after that it wont connect using the same established connection. so many cryptic errors or connection issues, so many verifications of the stupid i am not a robot despite that i already did touch id and text verification and user name and password to get in. every single time they error out, i have to redo the captcha bit with the pictures. which are the worst. i know that once it is set up it is an ok experience, but the setup is a nightmare that is representative of a free product not one that costs me a monthly subscription.
better than i thought. i would have given it 5 stars but i would like all the features on the app just like the browser but is overall good. they're making by easier to use also
"major step in the wrong direction. after a hard drive crash made me paranoid about losing my quickbooks desktop data, i decided to ""upgrade"" to quickbooks online. for a company called intuit, you'd expect their products to be, well, intuitive! this is the most difficult, buggy software or app i've ever dealt with. error messages constantly pop up warning that the work just done wasn't saved. when i check, it was saved. i've had to delete many duplicate entries from this. data entry that would've taken me an hour or so on my desktop version now takes several hours a night, several nights a week. i'm going to have to downgrade to a desktop version again, and will just pay monthly fees for cloud backups instead."
essential to running my business. this app is very helpful, highly recommended
great tool. awesome app, so far so good
ipad app keeps me up to date. i appreciate very much how handy the ipad app is for quickbooks online. it continues to add new & helpful features. the one i’m most happy about lately is being able to successfully “match” downloaded bank transactions. this keeps me connected to my actual cash flow without needing to have a bulkier electronic device with me. i travel a lot and being able to work with the qb online app is key to keeping my business successful.
error. the app is not letting me sign in! it keeps saying error!
easy and super user friendly. first time user of this type of app but it was easy to set up. sent out my first invoice after 1hr already.
great app. i love using this as i am away from the office it's so easy to use via phone or tablet
awesome interface. awesome app. that's what it says it will do. the only problem is when i log an expense it attaches receipts as images and not as pdfs. also i do not like the image scanner it doesn't trim around the edges of the receipt. i end up having to use a pdf scanner and then attach the receipt in quickbooks online in a browser.
great app - shame about the price. used this for almost 2 years now but need to find an alternative following a 70% price increase. it’s a shame, and it’s causing hassle for me in setting up my records with another accounting app but the only way we can object to such massive price changes is to cancel and leave.
"problems with quckbooks subscription and access to using the app. the software itself has worked for me; however i have had problems with my quickbooks subscription billing from the beginning. at the moment i have a paid up subscription directly with quickbooks (not through the itunes app store) i spent about 45min either being on hold or attempting to resolve the problem with quckbooks customer service yesterday and when i open the app it still is only granting me ""read only"" access. now not only can i not invoice my customers to receive payments i am sitting on hold with an estimated 21min wait time at the moment. this is ridiculous!"
more than convenient, it's necessary. having the app makes it so much easier to do business on the go. you can send estimates and invoices before the client meeting has even ended. efficient and essential!
great!. i've used quickbooks for years. very happy with the online. version, it allows me to take care of my invoicing anytime anywhere. my business is more profitable now because i can send an invoice when the job is complete and there's no forgetting to do it at the end of the day. if your business is mobile shouldn't your accounting be also?
great app. it's great to manage a small business.
meh, no project profitability reports in the app. as a construction business all our accounting revolves around p&l reports per project. the online/desktop app gives us the project report but the app does not, which makes the app pretty much useless. our best solution is to login to our qbo account through safari on the phone to see the real time project profitability, shouldn’t the app do that?
why the love. app just doenst work well - slow and just not a great experience.
love it, but needs some work. reeeallly wish i could cut a po on the app. other than that, the app is a great tool
disappointed. i love quickbooks online, but i'm disappointed with the app. i would really love to be able to do more with the app other than enter transactions. i would like to be able to run the prepared reports i already saved in the online version and print them on the go.
constantly signs me out.. it’s infuriating. just leave me signed in!!!!!! even worse sometimes as soon as i sign in it says “please log out and log in again” this app is bs
yudi m.. i use this app all day, i love it.
good good good. awesome program. everything you need to operate a small business. the ipad app is incredible. couldn't ask for more! we have been using qb for over 5 years. invoices and estimates on the go with ease/pay vendors/print checks/ manage expenses/ no sever or computer needed as its cloud based/ with the right accountant who knows what their doing he/she can have an accountant log in. unbelievable! and fantastic for around 30 bucks a month! who could ask for more..? some minor glitches with the phone app. overall 4 and 1/2 stars. would recommend to any small business!
make that 6 stars. love love love this app! makes life easier!
fantastic app. love love love this app. so easy to use, a must for any small business
no more ios 8 support. disappointed that app developers are dropping ios8 support. not everyone upgrades the second apple comes out with a new ios
great app. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😊😊
essential tool. this app is the greatest tool for invoicing.
needing improvements after more than a year. the app is good for entering transactions and it does this poorly. you have to perform searches which are cumbersome. despite the fact on mobile i have entered transactions for only five vendors, it shows a list of the vendors with whom have transacted business with the most for the last 15 years. this app only does a fraction of what the full online app can do.
easy to use. keeps me on top of my expenses every day. should have started using it months ago!
excellent. this app is making a huge difference to our business management. real time visibility of important financial data! to improve, id love visibility of scheduled bills, plus ability to make part payments to invoices. terrific!
can’t save photos or info. every time i try to save a picture of a receipt or input data, it will not save. feeling disappointed that i just purchased the subscription today. i’ve tried, uninstalling/reinstalling, turning off the phone, using the latest ios, the latest app version etc. i’ve been talking to a customer service rep for an hour and they can’t figure out what is going on with error code 10000. i may just cancel my subscription completely and continuing using the bizexpense tracker app.
updates have made it horrible. i love using the online version. the august updates however have tanked the app. it is no longer sharing information between my iphone, ipad, and mac. the sorting feature of estimates is now gone ( pending, accepted, closed) it only shows in last changed order, not good when working with 3 month or longer history. on a positive note, i do like the photo modification for the iphone. it no longer adds to my photo album, just imports to quickbooks.
"doesn't like ipads or phones. i don't find the app very useful. on a desktop, you can find your way around easily enough. on the ipad or phone, you cannot. i have yet to be able to bring up our main register balance....it takes forever and then gives me a ""no transactions"" screen. i have been a cpa for over 35 years. this app, although it has some promise, needs a little work."
horrible. this app and their customer service is terrible.
online version incomplete. need to make online app version as robust as desktop version - big miss.
best bookkeeping app. it has everything you need to make your small business life easy & hassle free!
not bad. convenient app. not as functional as quickbooks online, but it adds to its subscription's value.
better than the others but still need to work. when it’s working it’s working great. i’ve tried a couple different systems and quickbooks is by far the best with invoicing and estimates and excepting payments which is why the rating goes as high as four stars but it often crashes because i think it tries to do too much. also there is no way to change when the system starts counting days past due. you can set it for net 15 net 30 or whatever but it will start counting from when you create the invoice not when you send it. for me i create an invoice on monday and continue to add through it throughout the week and i send it on friday so by that point it already says it is past due five days so i have to set it as net 15 just to not make it scream at me
no employee section. this app contains nothing to help your employees, only the business manager. quick books could’ve at least added support for timesheets and such since they no longer allow you to save your timesheet in mobile browsers.
love the app!. convenient
easy to use, innovative and mobile friendly. we have been using qb at australiance.com for almost a year and i would not go back to my previous accounting software. the interface with paypal works well and save heaps of time for our online sales. it s easy to create expenses (e.g. business lunches etc), quotes or invoices on the go with the app + always know your bank account position as it interfaces directly with it.
very good.. we've been using this app and have been very impressed with it.
changed my life..!. qbo has made the bookkeeping side of my business a dream. it has given me so much time back. if i forget the rest my business to run as smoothly, i would be a happy man…
needs features. app seems to get bug fixes but vary rarely does it get new features. as a mobile professional i would like to have the same features in the app as on the computer. currently investigating other more powerful mobile options vs quick books update: can't even enter expenses with the app only a pc! in the usa they can enter expenses with the app.... wish i could deduct an extra star just for that.
buggy app. doesn’t even open, tried many times opening it on my iphone x for weeks. it doesn’t even open the app and there hasn’t been an update to fix that for ages. unable to use it on my phone and having to use it on my laptop which i don’t always have it on hand. please fix this issue.
yes! it crashed. sept. 26 it crashed. customer service new nothing about it the 29th. i have a 5. are you forcing me to upgrade?
frustrating inefficient. after reading the 4 and 5 star reviews i’m wondering what level of accounting these people do. there are so many features, views and functions that cannot be done on the mobile app compared to qbo online it constantly frustrates to the point, why even release this app in the first place! registry access, managing bills, creating invoices things that need to be done daily fall far short of the online or cannot even be completed here. intuit - this is far short of what i’ve come to expect from you.
not easy to use. simple tasks like entering a transaction are complex. app and online qb have a slow response when tapping things. just overall frustrating trying to switch from desktop qb to the app and online qb.
good and almost great.. the app has a lot of functionality and allows me to save hours of work a month by seamlessly connecting to the online version. i like the ability to enter receipts and sales as they happen, before i forget or lose the receipts. the only thing this is missing to make it 5 stars is the ability to read and recognize receipts instead of just taking photos. hopefully one day that will happen, but for now still a really, really good product.
easy to use!. love the app!
works great. business on the go! i wish there where a few more options, but all in all great app.
crashed when entered a sales transaction. downloaded this app to see if i could use it instead of at a computer and the app crashed as soon as i tried to enter a sales transaction. i tried to enter in the receipt type and it crashed
amazing app!!!. this is the most powerful and helpful app to manage a company, it it easy and friendly!!
qbo app. useless app, does not present a desirable layout compared to the the online version, in the banking area, to the bank register. somewhat comparable to using another account program.
great app. app is great and worked well with my iphone x but just updated to iphone 11 pro mac and app will not open crashes and closes every time please fix
class reporting is needed badly for the app. without class reporting this app doesn't provide a lot of use for someone with multiple locations.
great app a must for business. i have waited to switch to qb online as i had read a lot of negative feedback but this is a great app for keeping in touch with the finances of you business and easy for those not trained as an accountant
greatest app and programming. i’ve been using quickbooks online for the hess say at least eight years and before that i was using the books software on my computer and either way quickbooks has been great except my business structure strong and you always let me know what payments were paid and what is not. so thanks a lot for having such a great application and program and i hope you keep going in improving every day
"dissapointed. i was hoping for more. if the app has issues logging into a bank account, ect. it gives you an error code that you have to log onto there website to walk you through what it ""might"" be, then you have to go back and forth, try different things to fix it....ahhhh. you get my point😒"
it works ok. using this app for serval years now. mainly i’m bothered by the small glitches and performance of the app, not so much quickbooks. every so often a new annoyance will pop up.
"excellent product. i'm a freelance videographer and recently migrated from qb for mac desktop to qb online. qb online is a fantastic product and the iphone app is an immensely useful tool. i can quickly generate invoices and keep track of my business while in the field locally or on the road anywhere. most of my day is spent with a camera in hand far away from a laptop or office, so i use the iphone app all the time. it's great! only additions i might make: improve the ability to insert or move item lines while editing/creating invoices, make it easier set up a customer so i can email multiple individuals within a customer field when invoicing, make the addition of receipts easier to include (i currently snap shots of paper expense receipts, save to my camera roll, then use the ""add note"" feature in the app. if i have electronic receipts, i have to take a screenshot, then save that to my camera roll, and follow the same ""add note"" routine) it works fine, but it's bit clunky if you have many receipts, which i frequently do. all in all, an indispensable tool for my little business. thanks!"
great for invoices. i use it mainly for invoicing.
needs time keeping entry. quickbooks really needs to come up with an app to do their time entry for quickbooks online
amazing!. this app undoubtedly helps running multiple businesses on the road possible! when i finally switched my businesses from desktop to online there were a few things missing. i wrote a few complaints and spoke with their development team...few short months later...boom! additions were made! one if which is being able to switch businesses within the app. definitely much easier than logging in and out all the time.
mobile app for online qbb has problems. today has been particularly difficult when an invoice won't save. quickbooks tells me it is safe in the cloud, but it never is. now i keep getting a message on my ipad that my log in has expired, even though i just logged in. please fix this stuff. quickbooks is great when it works,
best app. very helpful online support
great functionality for mobile versatility, could be improved. qbo has made my invoicing and receiving payments from clients, much easier. i like the mobile aspect, app has just enough functionality that makes it easy and convenient to use. as of recent though, certain data won’t sync with qbo browser version. vendors, in particular, don’t sync up. this makes it a little tedious because you cannot see all your transactions in the app, even though it’s there in browser version. customer service has been excellent every time i’ve called.
app has gone downhill since update. youve just done an update and hardly anything works. buttons are unresponsive and crashes! sort it out
need options to customize invoices. please add more options to customize invoices. i need to add secondary contact information such as name, address and phone, along with the regular billing address. also, i would like to modify the invoice number. otherwise, this app is great for field use with my ipad+cellular. it has saved me tons of time compared with working on my laptop and quickbooks desktop.
mrs. love quickbooks and this app is sooo easy to use and love it!
great app. easy accounting program to implement and run with. great to have access across all my devices.
essential sme tackle. intuit recently upped their game quite dramatically with the reworked online interface, which is extremely slick and intuitive (no pun!)... or at least as intuitive as double entry accounting software can be for the layman... if they added the ability to set different product pricing structures for different customers and a decent cash flow projection tool, i reckon i could justifiable give it five stars.
best accounting app. the best accounting app by quickbooks . made accounting easy
qbo user. can't say i'm impressed. sure, it has your company info in it. but the most important functionality for a mobile user is time tracking. but there is no way to enter time on the run, in this app, that i can see.
simply doesn't work. my companies all use qb online. i access it via browser almost daily. this app routes me to an advertisement to switch to qb online, even if i use the admin credentials. i'll assume it's something with all of my accounts and not a shameless advertising plug.
great app. the fusion is terrific. quick books online plus this app had already simplified my life. no more double duty entering transactions. plus i now know who owes, and who's late without having to sit in front of a computer combing a bank printout. some things that could make it better...a linked paypal pay option in the invoice email, and a way for a customer to easily send a notice of payment. also, if i could pull in new customer or supplier info from my iphone contact list it would save a fair bit of redundant data entry, as i need the listings both places. but all-in-all a real winner.
work in progress, work not yet completed. very convenient and functional tomorrow to add expenses and receipts on the go. however only expenses not bills or other random transactions can be accessed through the mobile app. hoping intuit sees the feedback and that all transactions available including bills to be accessed on the mobile app.
good software. this software is very awesome. i work for the company but also use it for my own personal budgeting and it is extremely helpful but there are still a lot of bugs that need to be worked out with this app so that all the information updates correctly.
new to app. am enjoying being able to automatically list expenses & add receipts as i go. other apps promised this but kept crashing. i feel that i can now better control my finances.
great work!. the app works great and is a very useful tool for on the go business matters. i have not yet figured out how to add single time activities on the app ... not sure this feature is available. but other then that it's great!
so far so good.. love the app. i think it's great any time i can give an estimate, invoice on the road. thanks.
jordan hugo ,. i'm young and in business , only small but this app is perfect for tracking my expenses and sending quotes off. highly recommend.
top notch app for businesses. makes it so easy to run my business on the go!!!!
no ability. i download the app and signed up, then i realized that i have to be self employed
ok app. easy to setup. big difference between windows version and ipad version. like the amount of critical info showed. on the windows version all critical info is shown. on the iso device not enough info shown. like cash sale,
quickbooks app. great app. really useful.
updates have made it horrible. i love using the online version. the august updates however have tanked the app. it is no longer sharing information between my iphone, ipad, and mac. the sorting feature of estimates is now gone ( pending, accepted, closed) it only shows in last changed order, not good when working with 3 month or longer history. on a positive note, i do like the photo modification for the iphone. it no longer adds to my photo album, just imports to quickbooks.
entering bills?????. why have intuit decided not to support bill entering on this app?!? it great i can import my paper receipts using the camera, but whats the point if i can't enter as a bill only an expense?!?
good but not perfect.. some features missing that you get on the website for example, taxes. i haven't been able to add taxes to an item on the app. i'm sure there is an option but hard to find. also, why does it keep signing me out every now and then. i have to resubmit my password and then setup touch id again.
latest update messed it up. this app worked great --- until the latest update!! fix it
used to work. this last update has my app crashing and signing me out almost every time i use it. usually this is fixed quickly but it’s been a while now. please update the app so it’s doesn’t crash on the iphone x
intuit keeps working it but stumbles on occasion. i've been a qbo user for over 4 years now and run my whole one-man business on it. each app version is a bit better than the last and they do fix bugs when notified. i continue to be happy to see intuit continue to improve the app and the web interface. the blanking of bank account data in the dashboard appears to be fixed in v5.3.
6s (ios 9.x). it takes a while to learn the nuances of this app (and the online interface), but once you do, a decent enough experience awaits. note to devs: (1) the app freezes anytime you review added attachments (eg, receipts) when inputting expenses; and (2) users should be able to modify the method of payment when editing expenses (option currently unavailable) instead of having to delete and recreate the entry.
essential for my small biz. very useful app. does have some annoying issues ( crashes,signs out often, etc) but overall great app.
love this version of quickbooks!. we have multiple companies and run quickbooks in everyone of them. however, the last company we started i decided to use the online version to run this company mobile and absolutely love it! the app does need some accessibility features that are only available on the full version but it is still very user friendly.
amazing app. so great to use! still missing few features but gets the job done
bad update. last update renders the app useless
newest update doesn’t load dashboard. dashboard and home button do nothing now. iphone 11 pro max. blank screen.
perfect app. perfect app
my experience. quickbooks is a system designed for people in business to streamline there activities. in doing so allowing their accounting processes to flow more effectively. quickbooks has changed my business dramatically. thank you
perfect for in the go. i've used invoice2go, fresh books and a few other invoicing apps. quick books is the real deal and makes your life much easier. highly recommend!
latest update is garbage. update: 1/6/20 still a garbage app even after multiple emails back and forth with quickbooks development team and now it’s been weeks since i heard from them the app still don’t work even after new updates app has been great up until 3 weeks ago now it no longer works! crashes every time i try to open the app.
lots of bugs. been using this app for over a month now for all of my employees, we are constantly running into issues of the credit card payment built into the app not working, unless you set up your employee as an administrator they are unable to edit estimates and invoices, lots of issues, this could be a great app if everything was fixed but there is so many problems not sure if its going to be a good fit for my company, please update your app and fix these issues intuit!
overall pretty good. overall i'm pretty satisfied with the app. my one major complaint though is that it doesn't support third party keyboards. so when writing invoices or estimates on my phone i can't use my swipe keyboard which i've gotten very use to using as my primary way of typing. it is to allow third party keyboards, but then they took it away. it would be nice to see this return.
don't waste your time and money .. really waste of time to have it since its down at least once a week , not only that it does take few hours to back working and good luck talking to a live customer service also .on few occasions i couldn't issue invoices since its always saying that it's not connected to the internet and or can not save invoices at that moment . they really need to work on better version before they start charging people money for a bad service .
love this app and it's capabilities. the only feature i wish it had is to be able to see bills from suppliers.
great app. overall its a great app. you can do many things from the app that you can do on the desktop version. i would like to be able to enter the worked hours on the app and also to be able register vendor invoices not only expenses.
for last month since major online update its is useless. when i login it tells me i don’t have a subscription. i call support they tell me to uninstall the app and reinstall. after reinstall the login works but you cannot switch between your companies. i called them back. they said no one else is reporting this. three users in my offivr are having the same problem. i love the iphone app for entering receipts on the go but i can’t even do that now.
great app but .... i use this app frequently while i’m not at my computer but am disappointed that i can’t access my suppliers & update supplier bills etc, will you be able to add this feature?
only problem. i have a few problems the app is very slow when editing email address in the send invoice i don’t see a few things that i’d like - discounts for example no way to customize message to different customers most of this is pretty minor biggest issue is reconciliation of books at end of year
muy útil. la app es excelente, súper útil!! pero estoy pensando en dejar de usarla por que es demasiado costosa.
inconvenient. when i first got this app, i was able to link it to my bank account to track expensases versus spending. it worked for a while and at some point disconnected. i’ve tried numerous times to link it back up but nothing works. fyi i use an ipad pro. when i called we were on the phone forever for them to come to the conclusion that i need a desktop computer for it to work. after that they were not willing to help. aside from that, it constantly logs me out as i’m using it. not worth the $20 a month to do basic bookkeeping.
game changer. been using the desktop version for over a decade. now that i’m using qbo along with the mobile app i feel like i have been living in the dark ages! this is simple, useful, powerful and most importantly convenient! no more keeping up with paper receipts and forgetting to keep track of purchases.
great ap. great easy to use app really close to getting rid of my laptop entirely
great!. this app for quick books is fantastic! works just as it's supposed to! thanks!
annoyed again!!. i did the latest update and now i can’t even open this damm app! terrific ay! any suggestions qb’s!? can you get this sorted asap. a few updates prior to this lasted one, after that particular update all my company details except my abn disappeared, why? the app didn’t seem to save my details properly as i added them and it was like that until the following update. then everything was back to normal. pretty annoying!!
before update great after horrible. i have been using quickbooks for over 15 years. there always coming out with something new and most the time it works very well. this particular update makes it so i cannot except credit card payments via the app anymore. trying to get in touch with customer support or get any help on this issue has been a few hours of wasted time. still don't know what's going on i'm assuming this is their a way to force go payment users to buy the new chip reader so they can continue to except credit cards in day-to-day business. if you're reading this trying to decide to update and you use the standard headphone jack card reader and want to still receive payments via the app do not download this update.
"dissapointing. update- now my ipad ap asks me to rate it, but it locks the whole screen up. kills me. used to love this ap. but it has been garbage for some time now. takes forever to login and load on my iphone (even slower on my ipad). once you are finally in adding new customers or saving estimates is just as bad. have called customer support to find out what is going on and received the response ""we know about the issue and we are working on it"". this was over two months ago. i was added to their escalation list and have yet to receive an update. horrible customer service. actively looking for a different direction for our business."
needs improvement. i just started using this app while traveling. it doesn’t compare to the site on my pc. very unfriendly and difficult to impossible to bring up to date.much incomplete data. need to go to work on this one of its to be useful.
very good and getting better!. qbo has been a great addition to our company and has many great features over qb desktop. there are some bugs to work out but i'm very happy so far with the online application.
crash books. this app constantly gives me error pop ups! it does not work as described and has a difficult time doing anything that the desktop version does. i have two different companies listed on my account, and the app never will let me switch between the two. it always load the same one no matter which one i click on. if you use a lot of features and have multiple employees this app seems to have problems. needs a good bit of work to fix the bugs.
love the software. understanding that all software are more friendly on the actual computer than in the cell app, even though, the cell app is very helpful for invoices, estimates, reminders for payments “on the go” just to mention a couple of them. being an 8 years user from checkmark multiledger and payroll and making the transition to quickbooks is just a huge step forward and very efficient for my firm.
easy to use. generally easy to use. some limitations on app.
i'd complain about crashing. but it won't even open. i used this app every single day for years, now its trash?! get it working please. i have paperwork that needs to get done.
excellent customer service. i have been using quickbooks for a short while now but have found the app to be very user friendly and easy to use, one thing i wanted to mention was the outstanding customer service i received when i spoke to tom on the phone when setting up my account, he was very helpful and gave me faith that quickbooks is a platform that i will continue to use and feel like i have my own little team behind me helping every step of the way! thankyou so much!
best app ever. i am a tech on the go , and we made the switch from paper invoicing to quick books online. i cannot tell you how much this app saves me on time and frustration , everything is there at the tip of your finger. thanks intuit for making my work that much easier!
great app. it's good to use this to add pics of receipts to your account while you work on the mac. i have been waiting for this for such a long time. i needed something to replace the outdated ato's e-record.
fantastic app. the best bookkeeping app available. love this app. my bookkeeping has never been so up to date.
great app. an amazing application for small business owners. a personal accountant only for 700 egy a month + you learn accounting
could be better. it's good for entering payments, that's about it. and even that is a stretch because half the time it shows invoices are unpaid in the app while the desktop accurately shows the same invoices as paid.
session expired loop. every time i log in i get a session expired message and logs me out. app is not usable.
great but........ i love the app but it could use a bit more integration. for instance, you can airprint an invoice but you can't airprint a paid invoice. seems like an oversight.
labor cost. the software has all the infrastructure for tracking labor cost to individual customers. why can’t intuit enable it so the cost can be applied from weekly timesheets to the job cost of individual customers?
i love it my business run a lot smoother!!!. our customers are loving our new system
intuitive. great app! love it!
really wanted to love this app. everything appears to be top-notch, and still you actually start clicking around and trying to work with your data. example: i just deposited a check on the road. it was for an invoice. i went in to my refreshed account, clicked on the invoice, and attempted to market as “paid.“ a recurring error keeps popping up, every single time i try this, saying it won’t work. (“ ‘go to the help section“it says, which of course is no help at all) i really wanted to love this app because golly it is slick looking.
zero stars 10.3 is junk. i used this app several times a day. i run my business on this app. since april 10th i cannot access my data. my business is suffering and intuit cannot fix it. i still have to pay. tech support at intuit / quickbooks recommended i switch to a android. (i doesn't work on my iphone or ipad) i really do not want to invest in new hardware. stay away from intuit they do not care and offer no solutions.
not good for my use. i would like to have a setting to hide all account information so i can have employees out with ipads giving estimates or quotes. this is for personal business. good for that but forget trying to take pictures of receipts to write expenses.. takes longer than scanning them on my pc
j’aime!. it’s a great app. i love it!
expenses off. expenses are off. it’s showing expenses from an inactive account on the app. it’s correct on the website, so it’s definitely an issue with the app. i checked and the settings are the same. both should be displaying expenses for this month. also customer service was terrible. not one person was able to help and after five days of contacting one new person after another i finally unsubscribed. you should be able to assist a new customer immediately if you want to keep them long term.
still unresolved issues 3 month later. i’ve had quickbooks for over 3 month now and since i’ve had it i have been unable to allocate my bank transactions on my app. i’ve flagged this to quickbooks and had responses but no fix. keep being told to use desktop version for now! 3 months and still not fixed isn’t good enough for a payed for app.
works great. works great for my small business. not sure why there are bad reviews, qbo keeps up with my customers information, invoices, and estimates. very easy to use. now on this last update, i did have to uninstall and reinstall on my andriod phone, but within 5 minutes i was back up and running.
confusing. i used the trial a little while ago, and sort of went off it. just renewed the subscription now with the exact the same email, but quickbooks somehow created a new company instead! the support for backing up the company’s data is all over the place, since there are so many variants of the software/app.
unusable. doesn’t connect to my account.. every time i try to login it says there is no company associated with my account. it works fine through a mobile browser or desktop browser. the app is completely unusable, how convenient. tech support says there is a glitch...you don’t say.
"qb non compatible with new ipad pro. i recently purchased an ipad pro and was excited to use quick books online to manage my business. i downloaded this app but when i went to sign in, a message came up saying that i am unable to use the app if i am using quick books for mac or windows. well i'm not. and to add on to the problem, there is no ipad version of the quick books ""self employed"" app (which i'm assuming is what this app was intended for.) hopefully someone can address this issue soon so i am able to use my ipad for what it was purchased for and able to enjoy the ease of using quick books."
it's glitchy!. although it fulfills the need of having the ability to create estimates on the spot and re-send invoices quickly, it has glitches which are frustrating. on occasion it stalls and goes out of the app requiring you to log on several times and even restart your phone before be able to access the app.
brilliant!. easy to use, matches payments received and ties them off with your invoices, easy to see profit and expenses for each month. well worth the monthly payment, my books have never been so easy to keep!
vendors and purchases. this app is near useless. while it provides some info for sales, there are no purchase orders from vendors viewable in this app. just use a browser in you phone.
overall pretty good. overall i'm pretty satisfied with the app. my one major complaint though is that it doesn't support third party keyboards. so when writing invoices or estimates on my phone i can't use my swipe keyboard which i've gotten very use to using as my primary way of typing. it is to allow third party keyboards, but then they took it away. it would be nice to see this return.
updates. need more updates on the apps because i always have to go to my laptop to do certain things not like in that
helpful software, terrible customer service. the quickbooks software is helpful to any small business owner. especially if you are in the service industry and you're merely provide services. the software itself has many other helpful features and it really has helped us gain an understanding of the finances of our business. the one issue that we have is their customer service while friendly is not very helpful. we have had on several of occasions where they cannot solve a problem because they either don't have the technical know-how or the staff to do it. i'm not speaking of the actual accounting portion but rather if there were technical issues with the online software. we have gone weeks without answers to critical questions that we have for instance why none of our clients can receive emails from the online portal.
need better multicurrency functionality. ... an ok app to review transactions and do some basic entries.
great update to already great app. the latest update is great! being able to reconcile through app is awesome. best accounting app out!!!
limited. not much functionality compared with the desktop app, frustrating. unable to access banking or create bills. desktop app is terrible, every time i pay a bill and send an email payment notification i have to delete the words “thanks for your business!” as if i want to thank my suppliers for their business...
useless app. mileage tracking is grossly inaccurate, way too many inadequacies and limitations on the invoicing and accounting features. this app is a joke. i tried it for several months and have lost money as a result of it's shortcomings. the positive reviews here must be fake. do your research and search the web for accurate reviews. i recommend everlance as a better option.
touchid. touchid or pincode does not seem to work for login. it never gets asked when the app starts even after enabled. please fix. thanks.
binoy. easy to use interface love the app
qb intuit online app. fantastic program highly recommend 👍😀
good app i’ve grown fond of. makes my life 5 times easier. definitely worth the money
amazing accounting software for smbs. great capabilities and integrations. only downside is the ios app is not always reflecting all data from the software. i believe this will be fixed soon
glitches. app has lots of glitches. try to create an invoice and it was not working. quickbooks has been awesome up to this point. i run my whole business through quickbooks in this new update has been a disappointment. should've left it alone!
good app if you want to manually import your bank transactions. i previously have qbself employed and everything was fine. bank accounts would sync up. so i decided to get qb online for check printing capabilities. i started qb online beginning of feb 2019 and immediately became aware that my bank was not on qb online list of banks, but it was in the list of qb self employed banks ... weird right...? so i contact cs and they said they will make a escalated ticket and this matter should be resolved with 3-5 business days. well it’s almost 30 days later and bank account are not synced and have not heard from anyone from qb online. so i just recently contacted them again in chat support and they tell me that i need to contact my bank to see if they made some kind of change that would not allow me to connect. so in all reality they were never working on my ticket because if they were it seems they would have notified me to let me know that is what needed to be done.
app crashes constantly. i used to love this app. the last couple of months the app crashes daily and multiple times. i’m in the middle of working and the app says critical updates are needed and logs me out. i’m extremely frustrated with this considering i pay over $20/month to use this software across all my devices. no resolution or contact from customer service. it happens almost weekly. what a nightmare. looking for alternatives.
great app. great app. gives me complete flexibility while operating my small business!
horrible. this app is horrible. it's a complete waste of space. it has no real functionality worth talking about. it is no better than the mobile site which is also useless.
app crashing. after updating to the new version, app is crashing. kindly resolve the issue. not able to use
please fix this asap!!!!. this update is horrible and does not work properly at all! data doesn't refresh and i keep getting error messages. the only (very temporary) fix is to delete the app and redownload it - daily! lame! this must be addressed immediately.
multiple companies. love the app when it's working properly. doesn't switch between companies well, it'll show customers for my other company under the wrong account and makes it impossible to actually work from. i'm sure if you just have one business account it works fine.
best app. i am using this app for my business. it is so easy and accurate. i really like it.
does what i need. app is easy to navigate and has all functionality i am looking for.
small business asset. easy way to keep track off all those expenses, invoices, payments etc for a small business owner with little time to spend on administrative stuff.
works great for what i use it for. i run a simple personal business and this app has all i need!
doesn't work for ipad. this app doesn't even load my company info. it keeps returning error trying to load company info. i have contacted quickbooks a number of times and all they say is they are working on the issue and to use a web browser version in the mean time. i have seen about 4 updates released and not one of them has fixed this issue. when will this be fixed?
owner. great app nothing more to be said. everything is so organized. i love it!!
i love how this app crashes every time.. can't even test the app as it crashes on the login screen. finally got past the login screen but it crashes as soon as i try to get into settings. i'm sorry quickbooks but my company can't operate properly and efficiently with such a buggy program. we need to be mobile and can't have apps that crash in the field. i've been using qbo since the beginning and we will have to move on to another program that's stable, has more feature, and will also allow us to do service schedule out in the field m it's been fun but so long qbo. hope some day you'll figure it out.
great app. first time business owner and have to say it's a great way to stay organized
so far so good. i've been using the app for a week and love it so far. i find it extremely easy to make invoices in the field, and also very convenient to accept payments.
"there photo above shows signature capture, it does not have it. no signature capture update : response to developer 8-5-17 puzzled ? as am i 🙄 i called in 4 times about this ability to capture signatures first time i called the customer service person tells me, no we dont have that no you cant. then i asked why is it your help center data base clearly stating plain as day instructions on how to. 1. create new invoice 2. enter all needed information 3. click on the capture signature. also not to mention the fact the screen shot here in apple app store for quickbooks clearly shows a signature being captured. so after lots of back and forth tells me this is a new and quickbooks company doesn't tell them (customer service) what quickbooks os doing. what!? got off the phone didn't want to waste anymore of my time. round 2 call customer service tells me that its not capable of capture signatures, then after guided her to your help center where it clearly states how to puts me on hold then comes back and says that its new and there and there implementing it in in phases !? and my account number is part of phase 3 and would add the capture signature button in 3 weeks. ugh ok i guess i can understand that. round 3 called in again she also tells me no its not possible explained my last call with customer service and stated i was checking on the the update phase. after explaining the last call i had to this customer service rep. she was more bewildered than prob you are right now reading and she to was left puzzled as was i. then proceeded to put me on hold to research. comes back tells me yes you can but only if you have a merchant services account through you. hmm thats odd i thought. she tells me that the signature capture is for payment credit card. so i proceeded to explaining a plain signature capture by a customer on an invoice. she proceeded to tell me no unless you have a merchant account. ok fine over, but before i got off i guided her to the help area in quickbooks if you search how to capture signature. it clearly says so and what she told me didn't match with what was posted on the help area. which is capture signature---available on invoices and estimates. now if your estimate is being signed i didn't know you had to have a merchant account and i didn't know thats industries standard to run a credit card transaction off of an estimate. in the end puzzled as you are and pretty much moving on to another service unless you can find someone that knows what exactly is going on over there at quickbooks. that i will end up speaking too someone that knows what there doing and what there talking about, i will not call and waste more of my time . and by the way your web browser version of quickbooks online on a mobile device does not load correctly the right side is cut off making the invoices or anything you do on there useless im on an ipad 12"" pro. doesn't matter what browser you use same prob, try using the app instead but cant as it lacks all the features the browser version does. so any way you cut it. no signature capture something so simple to do. please let me know what you think of all that, im trying to be helpful here as i expect better from quickbooks your industry see your help instructions below capture signatures using quickbooks online for mobile open a new or existing estimate or invoice. add any transaction info, as usual. select get signature. let your customer sign with their finger. they can always clear it and sign again. select done (android) or save (iphone/ipad). you'll see the signature on the estimate or invoice. it's that easy! update: 7-27-17 there is no signature capture on invoices even though they tell you there is there is not. it only applies through tak ing payment by credit card transaction through quickbooks. something that is so basic to business the leading book keeping company can not provide. walk into customers store drop product they sign the invoice received! thats it! nope not quickbooks so pass them up. plus thats not counting time hours and hours of lousy customer service and back and forth till they finally fessed up to it. don't waste your time."
great book keeping app. use this app with the online version at home. very happy with it indeed. support could be a little better. but support is adequate. been using it for a couple of years and i'm very pleased.
great app for busy employers/employees. your features are reduced and it's not the exact same as when you use a pc but it is still really nice. i would not be want it to be as in depth anyways it's nice and simple. i would recommend it to anybody that needs quickbooks on the go. we do a lot of work in the field and it is really nice to do estimates and email them to the customer while standing right next to them.
terrible experience. downloaded quickbooks to try it out. two days into the free trial i tried to get the discount through uber and was over charged for 6 months of service after the payment “ failed to process” then checked my bank statement to see it charged my account 6 times(each for 1 month of service) i called and waited on hold for an hour. finally talked with someone who could not help me and recommend i call uber to see if they charged me. the whole experience has been terrible. waste of time and money, would not recommend to anyone. find a cheap/free app that works and doesn’t steal money from your account.
horrible accounting program. barely an accounting program. one would think qb would create an online version mirroring their desktop software. navigating the online software is a headache, let alone using it for basic accounting purposes. of course qb ever improving their software is as likely to happen as me winning the lottery.
great app, easy to use!. this is a great financial management app. i'm far from an accountant but once you have your chart of accounts set up, keeping track of expenses and income is a breeze! a few swipes of your finger and you can reconcile your bank accounts. if only more things were this easy!
great app!. very user-friendly and convenient. great for people who are needing to create invoices and estimates and track expenses. the iphone app is fantastic!
touch id doesn't work. i love this app but it is completely inconvenient when you enable touch id and it logs you out and makes you enter your password every time you open the app. super annoying and really my only complaint.
quick book app works amazing!!. love using the app for my tree company lets me be on the road and make up invoices.
need improvement asap. need to approve the app asap due to many loss of customers. disappointed of the high price.
not a trustworthy app. i have just started using this app in mid october and it is now nov 18, 2019. when i first signed on, i was offered to use the app for three months at $12.49 per month as a special promotion. of course i clicked “ok” since i felt to really see if this app would work for me i would need three months to test it. my first impression of this app was good because it did help me to organized all of my income and expenses in a neat clean application. in fact, i was able to balance my money and found missing money . however, there where many time where i had to reset my phone because the app would freeze. this glitch prevented me from connecting my bank account and credit account to the app itself. i figured i’ll give it another month to see if this problem gets fixed, i’ll trust it with my account numbers. today it only allows me a (read only) version of this app unless i pay the full 24.99 a month, but i’m only on my 2nd month of the promotion that i signed up for. i still would like to only pay $12.49 like i originally signed up for before i fully commit my entire business to use this app. i haven’t even connected my credit or bank accounts yet because it still freezes from time to time. i would not have entered all of my private information as well as my regular customer private information if i knew that intuit was going to go back on their offer on their promotion. this kind of deal does not inspire trust in using this app. i have a pic on my phone saying that this was the subscription i originally signed up for
pretty complete finance from your phone. i'm not too sure about the need for a separate app for payroll, but this does work as advertised for the most part.
quickbooks saves me time & money. this app has streamlined my business as i am always on the go. its easy, efficient and powerful!
for what do you need my number?. are you seriously? i have to make up an account with number? for what do you need this information? why u can’t make an app without stupid registration?
it's scam don't download 19.99 per month they took from my account. i just did download almost 8 month ago this app they took from my account almost 19.99 per month after cancel also they are robbing very bad don't download at all even no customer service to help you to talk also bad bad super bad
great little app. excellent app for basic book keeping invoicing etc and keep up with the book keeping on the fly. but to do the serious stuff you still need to work from a laptop or desktop.
business saver. great for on-the-go business needs. allows me to create invoices and send to customers for immediate payments. everything i need!
improving. intuit continues to refine the app. it will really shine when they incorporate a robust pos system that shares items across their own platforms.
good app and makes life easier. it's a easy app to use and simple to navigate.
great but. i think this app looks great. it is not supposed to be a stand alone accounting app at this time. it is supposed to be a companion to the online version. so far it seems to flow better then the iphone version and it fixed some of the bugs. main problem so far is you can not open up items boxes when filling out a estimate or invoice. you can scroll but if you have a long description this is just impractical. you can do this with the iphone app so i see no reason why we should not be able to on the bigger format. without this feature it forces us to still use the iphone app. i believe qb online is moving in the right direction. the are adding and updating all the time. that being said i hate to do it but will have to give it just two stars for now. i believe one other review was right in that they really do need to get some heavy users like myself and others that use qb online and adapt it a lot to make it work over other software like wintac etc....
highly recommend for startups. qbo does everything that i need it to. it is a great dashboard to see where i am at, with the ability to add details to all of my transactions.
no sales receipts. this app is pretty decent, but lacks the essential functionality of sales receipts. gopayment isn't a solution either because it doesn't link to customers. when can we expect sales receipt functionality?
absolutely fantastic!. this app is incredible. having been using for 6 months, and it has revolutionised the way we are able to do business. so easy to setup, use and understand. i highly recommend to anyone that needs an easy order/invoice/sales system for their business.
very good app. good
love the app. very fast an easy
expenses off. expenses are off. it’s showing expenses from an inactive account on the app. it’s correct on the website, so it’s definitely an issue with the app. i checked and the settings are the same. both should be displaying expenses for this month.
absolutely love it! best business accounting app. great mobile online app/ tool that syncs with your online quickbooks on both mac and pcs. is everything that you could ever want or need for bookkeeping, accounting, invoicing and estimates.
not working properly after update #2. people have businesses to run!! i understand glitches from free/cheap apps. not something that costs $360/year. my books don't match from my phone to my computer. the pin still doesn't work, every time i edited an invoice it magically created a copy of an invoice that showed up 2 days later. now i have a ton of clean up to do in my books. it's time for me to find new accounting software.
not working with ios13.0. not able to click on customers, create new estimates or invoices. tried reinstalling. still no luck.
great app. love that i can get estimates approved right on my phone!
quickbooks app. does not work well. needs a lot of improvements. each time i back up my files i end of with multiple copies on my ipad. have called several times and each time they blame the app developer which i have contacted but never heard back from them. poor program that needs fixing to get it up to good standards. do not recommend until they fix problems.
left hand doesn't know the right. when i switch from logging in online to the ipad or iphone, the app doesn't seem to be updated with the new information. case in point, my credit card was hacked so i had to update my account info on all my subscriptions that used that number. i received a notice form qb that my account was suspended. apparently it isn't possible to update the subscription info from the app, so i did it online. now when i open the app it still says my account is suspended. one of many glitches that exist between the app and the online experience. needs to be streamlined!
so easy. this app is user friendly and intuitive. i like being able to see the reports and add attachments to expenses. highly recommended for small businesses owners.
okay app. the apps okay to keep you updated on overdue accounts and to see what has been paid.
great app!. i was using quickbooks pro desktop 2013 before going to online 2016. all i can say is wow! i never realized how much i was missing. reconciling expenses with automatic bank and credit card transaction downloads can be done on my phone anywhere and anytime. no need to log into bank and manually download. huge time saver. also keeps me up to date on my finances with great reporting built in and at my fingertips.
update crashed. i have all of my quickbooks point of sale ipads that cannot open the app since the update! we have all had to resort to computers and phones to run our business! you may want to consider this before you join up with quickbooks! they are notorious for problems relating to their quickbooks online.
works well for small business of software development for myself. love having receipts and invoices from vendors attached directly to my invoices and expenses in quickbooks. works well on the go!
jordan hugo ,. i'm young and in business , only small but this app is perfect for tracking my expenses and sending quotes off. highly recommend.
app does not open. after the latest update, the app does not open. it has been a real inconvenience.
how did i run my business without it?. i do half my estimates and invoices on the go with this app. saves me so much time!
subscription does not work. after 1 month free trial (in which i never been interested as i was happy to pay from beginning) the app stoped working. payment is demanded, unfortunately on ipad or iphone version either it is not possible to make a payment/subscription or the instructions are not clear enough or there is an error. to subscribe should be made as easy as possible.
great app. makes life easy. one addition will make it perfect. add journal entry to the app.
pllease fix the contact list. overall i love the app. i've been using my ipad pro for traveling more but we need this app up to speed. in sales view i would love a simple addition to show next to the invoice if it was sent, opened or not sent. it's a simple change and would save a lot of time instead of having to open up each invoice. also, would like to see a total amount of outstanding invoices at the top, not just divided out in overdue and due. i'd also like in sales view to be able to sort by po number and invoice number. would also be nice to have a note icon next to each invoice number that if we click on it, it opens to show the notes we wrote my biggest issue that i have been requesting on all quickbooks online apps for a while now is the feature the billings app used to have for free. a simple list of all the clients emails for that particular company in a list with a check box next to each. we can select our repeats to automatically select those to include in estimates and invoices. but we can easily click to add others or remove them and have a note next to the names. it helps so much to have all of those email addresses for each specific client to select from. currently, we have to go in to the clients info page and add the email there or go and copy / paste it into my email. both do not seem very organized were thought out for an app it's expensive considering the free app you took over had it before. plenty of large companies just bringing freelancers or they have different people handling billing. we need a faster, simpler solution to select company email addresses foe each estimate/invoice. please address these issues. if so i will change my rating to five for sure but right now there is room for improvement.
what a life saver. i needed something to simplify the data input that comes with invoicing and dealing with the piles of receipts with the flexibility of not having to open up my laptop to do so every time. when i saw a promotion to try out quickbooks online with ability to have access on mobile devices i figured i'd give it a try. it's been a life saver. my account transferred seamlessly and quickly. it eliminated having to manually enter my credit card purchases and bank account transactions because you can link those accounts right to quickbooks and they update automatically. i can take pictures of receipts right from my phone or ipad and take care of them immediately as well as emailing invoices or recording payments received right from my phone or ipad. it's great having this ability on the go. so far i've discovered that i do have to log onto the website directly to get more detailed/specific reports, but it's possible i just haven't learned how to do it yet via the app. thanks for simplifying my life in this aspect anyway. hoping it makes tax season a little easier.
disappointed. after everyone raving about this app, i decided to look into it. i was offered a discounted joining fee before i had even looked at it and this was withdrawn if you did not take it there and then! having joined i thought it was okay but not for £10 a month. looking online i found a six month deal for £3 per month and it had the features i was looking for. but, having enrolled the old account had to close; not a problem only the new account does not have an app/mobile feature. the opening spec said it did! i like a product that does as it should for a good price. this is not that and is not fully transparent. shame.
app not working. the app won't open on my phone.... just says downoading company info. have already rebooted phone and re-installed
my dream come true. i started using quicken back in the early 90’s, one of the features offered was the ability to download bank data from participating banks. unfortunately the bank that i used didn’t offer that feature. i envisioned a day in the future in which all banking & credit card data could be automatically downloaded into my computer, virtual eliminating the exhaustive data entry that was needed, finally, quickbooks has answered the call. we use the online version for our company, we had it customized by a 3rd party vendor and we absolutely love it. we send & collect most of our invoice payments ach (direct deposit) through the quickbooks secure network...which is fabulous. the app provides great info & abilities that i utilize as well. i would highly recommend this product kevin @ true restorations inc.
major flaw. the app ui is pretty good and i really like the interface. the problem is that a lot of my invoices are not even viewable on the app. basically anything that has a delayed charge on it won't show up so there is a major glitch there or something.
pdf note on ipad. why can't we add a pdf note on ipad app. i can do it by accessing desktop version on ipad. but it's a pain doing it that way. it would be simpler to add that option to the app. come on guys keep up with the technology. quit lagging behind.
everything i need. the quickbooks app has met every one of my needs for my small handyman business. i love the ability to email customers estimates, invoices, and sales receipts while i am standing there with them. i have only been using the app for a little over a month but i feel good about my decision to go with quickbooks online.
all the essentials in an app. works good so far. allows for quick sorting of transactions and gives all of the essential components for a mobile version. it would be nice to be able to work in budgets in app.
love quickbooks app. very easy to use definitely recommend
n entendi nd. tenho 17 anos, nao entendi nd, sou burra ou esse app é ruim? talvez a primeira opção, mas de qq forma n gostei
subscription bug driving me crazy!. for the last few weeks the quickbooks app has been unusable! it alerts me that my subscription has expired and will lock me out of any activities. i have been on the phone with tech support, my subscription is up to date, it gets fixed for a day and then the problem re emerges the next day. this is an excellent app when this problem does not exist. i use a fully updated ipad pro. please fix this bug!
great app. convenient. quickbooks app is very easy to use and makes tracking expenses quick and easy.
poor sales tax function. i have been using this app almost 20 months now. i like almost all abilities, except for the sales tax portion. when making an invoice one must click on the tax bar near the bottom of the page, a menu appears and you can select the tax district that you are currently doing business in. problem is the same district is listed several times causing real problems when the time comes to print a report and submit payment to the state. i have called the tech line several times and wasted many days trying to correct. there is no actual human or team that will assist with app problems. you can get help for online versions for you pc but not a tablet. stay away qb will not back this product!
solid except.... i like that it keeps sync of everything smoothly. there's no wait time, and if so i never notice it. it's fast and convenient. best accounting software hands down! the app is smoother than the mac desktop version, this should be fixed!
perfect app for any small business owner. as a qbo pro advisor my opinion may be somewhat biased but i can not brag enough about the software, customer support and resources offered by quickbooks/intuit. qbo has allowed me to become a completely virtual bookkeeping firm, increasing my service area, customer satisfaction and turn around time. love love love them!!
average at best - limited functionality. this app is not a first release but still lacks many features needed to make it worthwhile. the app doesn't offer full functionality and will let you do thing like create and send invoices but won't let you run your business from the road or while on vacation. the bank feeds you set up in the desktop cloud interface are not viewable and you can not categorise transactions. this is offered in the usa version though. the invoices look sharp on screen on the app but when you send them they revert to the ugly templates intuit provide. also if you run a business with multiple brands / sub brands or trading names you can only use the parent company business name and logo. massive flaw if you sell over different channels. intuit have a good base here but the development is incredibly slow. look back at the forums and see that feature requests have been asked for over 12 months and not been developed even though they are basic things that xero offer. worthwhile having the app, but don't be fooled thinking you can use it for running your business books.
qbo saves us time and unnecessary work.. we love using the app at our company. integrating the payments and signing contracts on ipads has helped make a huge difference.
landscape company. i like this app as it helps me stay on top of the billing before i leave the site. but the client care and billing is horrible customer care is the worst in north america. stay far away from this company. they bill you when they are not suppose to.
tons of bugs and glitches. there are lots of glitches and lack of features in this app. the vendor transaction history is spotty, many vendors and missing history all together. profit and loss report doesn’t scroll. can’t see the true checkbook register of checks that are written out but haven’t yet cleared. it’s really not very good.
dig it!. i mainly use the app for looking at financials, but the invoicing, reporting, and such is great too.
excellent solution. moved from qb desktop longtime user 9+ years this app and the online approach work really well.
productive. one app that is recommended for everyone. it helps you become your own ca and with no knowledge one can start and keep everything on tips.
i am truly loving this app. been hunting for a simple app for managing the finances of my farm business. this helps me with capturing and analysis of all my expenses and income. the reporting is also amazing. i also love the fact that i can even get more stats and reports via the web. amazing stuff. already introduced it to quite a number of industry colleagues. truly an amazing app
forced payroll system not working. since march 2017 our payroll that they force you to pay for if you have employees has not working correctly. edd efile is non existent, cannot archive reports, and irs efile is sporadic. customer service wont credit any amount nor can they fix the problem even after “escalating” it to priority customer support. three “cases” opened, none of which fixed the problem. do not buy this product.
qb has revolutionized business accounting. i have been using qb online since 2011 and can honestly say that it has delivered an exceptionally easy and effortless business accounting solution. one touch payroll and the ease of ap and ar management is awesome. i do all the accounting for my startup and i rely on qb to make it all possible. qb is continuously improving both the desktop and mobile apps to make my life easier. thanks doyle heisler founder wanamaker corp
cc payment signature window. love the app but, something was changed in one of the recent updates. the screen for the customer to sign to authorize cc payment was made into smaller window. every time you touch it to try and sign, it just moves the window up and down. you can barely make a single line. starting to get frustrating for customers and myself. please address this asap thanks!
feedback. the app would be better if you were able to enter bills not just expenses. very annoying to have to also use my desktop computer to finish my book work.
good on the go. it’s easy to make invoices on the spot for customers and receive payments. i still prefer sitting at a computer but this app really helps while i’m on the go!
a pretty good app. update: they added deposits! it does everything i need now, upgrading to 5 star! all in all, this is a pretty great app. it does just about everything i need it to while on the go, but it is missing one key piece of functionality. it does not allow the recording of deposits and that is really important for me. other than that it functions flawlessly and has never given me any trouble. overall, i love it!
nice work. each revision makes the app even better. i did not appreciate the price increase but if the service continues to improve then it is valuable to my organization.
not good for my use. i would like to have a setting to hide all account information so i can have employees out with ipads giving estimates or quotes. this is for personal business. good for that but forget trying to take pictures of receipts to write expenses.. takes longer than scanning them on my pc
good app. app does what it says it will do!
no good. this app only works if you have the online account version
"frustrating. the number one use for this app should be to keep track of activity on the go so you don't play catch up at the office. for me, not being able to bill my clients for expenses through the mobile platform renders this app basically useless. i still have to remember to log in and find the expenses of the day and mark them as ""billable expenses"" when i return to my computer?!?"
great invoicing app. work great for invoicing needs.
very easy and convenient!. i love having the mobile app. it makes it easy to enter transactions on the spot without having to stop and open up my computer to login.
awesome app!. i love this app. the ability to check the status of an invoice or review an expense on the go is amazing.
awesome app. easy to use. intuitive. great mobile app.
still needs improvement. there's still lots of room for improvement. one area to work on is having the mobile app work seamlessly with the laptop version of the app. i should be allowed to attach receipts to estimates & invoices in draft on the mobile app.
not accurate. even after the most recent update the app still dose not accurately reflect my qbo account. all information on vended and clients are not up to date. this had been an ongoing issue for more than a year now. i keep hoping with every update this will be correct, but nothing yet.
ios 13 incompatible. was using this app, working fine on my ipad with ios 12 but updated phone to ios 13 and will not load app but crashes every time i open it. i’m not paying for a dud app. fix it or refund my subscription.
just barely ok.. app has multiple issues . with page format. browser must use google chrome to get all options . called 3 times , on phone over hour each time . weeks later still nothing fixed . app is very limited .. customer service is a joke . here i thought i was upgrading to a better software . lol i was so wrong ..
very good app.... i truly love this app! it permits me to oversee my business' financial condition in real time. i use the qbo plus, it would be nice if it had more of the options present in qb premium for consultants. the project management and customer billing customization would make this an even better app.
hardly for the novice. i anticipated this software to meet the basic needs of my new business, and replace an office manager. (if i can use an online tax filing software made for idiots, i can do this, right?!) wrong. first, only the self-employed version has true mobile capability. but that version is not capatible with every other version they sell you. every version upgraded from there requires a computer, or multiple apps, that aren’t independent of computer setup. information is not easy to find/learn. it’s buggy. i cannot add a bonus to the same check as regular pay. i cannot customize invoice fields, to add a po # requirement. it would be great for pop ups to tell me what the outcome of my choices mean. i shouldn’t be complicated to cancel a check that was lost and rerun it as a direct deposit without deducting taxes the second time. for the importance of saving my sanity, i don’t need this software, i just need to hire a capable secretary! quickbooks rating ages 4+, really?
greatest app ever. i love the “capture receipt” feature. makes life a whole lot easier.
really frustrating app. very frustrating app both on iphone and qbo. very glitchy and customer support is terrible. if the they didn't force you to use a subscription-based model, i'd use the installable version on quickbooks. i'm sure other have less problems, but it has not been a good experience for myself or my company.
easy to use. love this app, easy to use.
good app. works for me.
still a ways to go but the upgrades needed are so simple they only get 3 stars. so it's quickbooks..it ichat is folks. theo line version has come a loooonng way since the creation of it. i've now switched from the desktop version to online. but just simple things that the desktop version does that online can't or won't make you really scratch h your head. i have two very different businesses, hence i have two different logos. but qb online only allows one logo. really!! wth...don't suggest the invoice template to upload a custom logo invoice. it's a total joke.. and speaking of total jokes..you will be inundated from intuit when invoicing to turn on their ach and credit card online payments. inundated!! until you finally decide to do this..then, you'll be prompted to fill out a credit app and expected amount of charges. if you don't make the grade with qb, i.e. charge enough every month you get a nasty rejection letter stating you've been turn down for bad credit....seriously, you simply can't make this up. i called them, incredibly offended and angry as i have perfect credit only for online customer service apologize and acknowledging that was offensive and a mistake. you were turned down simply because you don't bill enough as a small business. folks, qb online works. but you have been warned about its inefficiencies.
love it. what a wonderful app for running a biz.
business on the run. quickbooks online with the ios app make operating a travel based business on the run simple. log invoices as you go. input estimates along the way. print and mail or email all at once at the end of the day. not to mention the helpful reports and expense management. i couldn't run my business without it.
good app!. add travel tracking to app
great app. easy to setup and use.
app doesn’t recognize credentials. this app worked well for me until the most recent update. now i cant login, says can’t find the account with this email/password. this is very annoying since i travel frequently without a laptop. now i’ve lost the ability to access my accounts via the app.
no longer loads. after upgrading quickbooks online, this app no longer loads on ipad or iphone. please fix.
best app i use. i have been using this app for about 30 days now and it dose everything i need it to do on the go. the only thing i would add is the ability to make a deposit in quickbooks via the app. if you use quickbooks you should have this app
quickbooks phone app. so easy i can’t believe it.
ripoff price increase. as of 7/1/19 the new quickbooks online price will be $70/month. considering the lack of functionality of the app. and the bugs that never get fixed on the desktop clients, i would recommend going back to the desktop version. let’s see....the desktop qbooks premier version can be used and supported for 3 years at a discounted cost of $350-400. the online version will cost you $2520 for 3 years. you decide whether you want to reward intuit for the bait and switch approach of luring you away from the desktop version and then clobbering you with price increases from $30 to $50 and now $70 for the online semi-functional version.
waste of space. all we want to do is access quick books online via our ipads. this app is worthless. as my business continues to grow we will obviously be looking for a software provider that listens to clients instead of putting out disappointments like this. save the space on your ipad and don't bother.
greta app. great app. does the job and provides me accessibility through my ipad or iphone. very easy to understand and easy to set up invoicing with your logo. allows you to easily print different reports, calculate gross profit and profit margin per invoice. very solid app.
o melhor app. o melhor app para gestão empresarial simplesmente nunca usei algo parecido
great app but missing some things. i think this is a great start to the quickbooks app! it is clean looking and well organized. you are able to enter in or download transactions, refer to client information and many other things. my only complaint is that you cannot reconcile any accounts in the app. i would love to be able to reconcile. it would get 5 stars from me if the app could do that.
be careful how you pay for your subscription. as many others have mentioned before, this app suffers from serious lack of usability when it comes to backup and restore. let’s start with some basics. the software itself is great. i very much enjoy it. but beware, they want to monopolize the subscription market so their online software does not work with their desktop software. so you’re either paying monthly forever or not able to make out an invoice or expense on mobile. beware of how you pay for your subscription!!!! if you subscribe through a third party like apple, you can never stop. my subscription expired and i clicked on the “renew” link that popped up in the app. when i did so, it took me to a renewal page where i put in my cc info and added payroll. turns out, instead of renewing my existing company, they started a new one for me and were unable to transfer the payment info over because the existing company was locked into third party payment processing. this started the process of having to backup my data and import it into the new company that had payroll attached. as mentioned before, you have to export your data using an archaic system in ie. then most importantly, you cant even import the same file that qbo exported and used to backup your data in the first place!!! it forces you to download quickbooks desktop and import the file there and then export it from desktop to qbo. you can’t even download quickbooks desktop for free. the trial link doesnt work. so, in my example, i am currently stuck with a third party payment processor whose payment info i can’t change (in other words i can’t separate my personal and corporate business expenses on a recurring monthly basis) and a system that i can’t transfer over. worst product support ever worst integration ever worst payment system ever
great!. continues to impress and improve on this very useful app. i use it daily for bids, invoices and expenses. the addition of the ability to record expenses and photograph receipts has made my life so much more easy. and to be able to quickly add clients, easy estimates and quick invoices and finally receive payments is unbelievable and wonderful.
lacks a lot of usefulness. this app is pretty good but misses a lot of the functionality that you would hope to have. it can only run a few of the reports and can only assign some of the expenses in the banking features. the app continues to get better, just wish it made the big leap.
very good. the app works well i would say that it is easier to use and better than quick books online. (i do understand that the online has to do more) it links well with online and being able to photograph receipts and invoices and applying them to the relevant file is great.
quick books on my phone!. i just found the iphone app and so far, i'm loving it. no longer tied to my laptop and spotty internet on the road.
invoices on the go with ease!. it is said that the measure of success is doing your job well and with ease. i work several different jobs, one job is office manager for a local repair shop. i no longer have to wait for the boss to physically come in to the shop to review invoices. we can also do invoices while on the job site which helps get us paid faster. communication between my boss and my self is much improved since we can see exactly what the other is doing. this app has allowed me to do my job well and with ease. thank you! one feature i would like to add is to flag invoices and label the invoices as printed / mailed. currently, i have to go back through the activity log or write a note to accomplish this. again, thanks.
excellent. love this app!!
great but needs some updates. just recently i am unable to log in to my company. i can get on to my online account, but not on the app?? says my email and password isn’t found?
like the app but need update for iphone 6 plus. app and software work well for my business but i was disappointed that the app on a iphone 6 plus is just magnified from the 5s. i really hoped it was a scaled ipad experience. really... no landscape mode?
quickbooks. great accounting app, been using quickbooks for years now and it keeps getting better. i would be lost without it. so easy to use with great tutorials. i'd highly recommend.
great app and the best accountancy system so far.. i've tested many different products from competitors and quick books is the best so far. i've used online version first and then downloaded mac app which is quite fast to use. mobile app works seamlessly with both and its great business tool. i don't really understand other negative reviews and people having issues with software. please make sure you're using latest updated version of the app and your ios. thanks matt
rnm media and sound. it’s a great app and system. lovely to use and easy to get around. they must just add online reception and receiving of payments. this will make business much much easier.
do not upgrade to latest software!!. i have used this app for almost a year and it has worked very well for my small business- until today. after automatically updating itself on the app store, i can no longer save invoices and send it to my clients. i've tried restarting the app and my phone, but the problem continues. i went on the app store reviews to see if others had had the same problem, and bingo! many other users are complaining of the same issue. i hope quickbooks can figure out this problem asap before it really starts affecting my business accounting. likes: -stores repeat client info - allows for cc payment - allows me to include my company logo and information on each invoice. - alerts me of tardy invoices - provides me with easy to read charts and measure each months income/expenses dislikes: - credit card payments incurs a hefty fee rather than a monthly charge - all of my invoices have an intuit logo - customer service is hurting. wish they had a 1800 # or immediate online chat support like so many other software companies.
they just keep changing the app.. my biggest complaint about the app is the limited features on customer entries. the pc version you can enter a customer as tax exempt on the phone you can't. further if you open the customer information on the phone and save it it will clear the tax exempt status on the pc version as well. so it is a constant battle to keep who is and isn't exempt straight.
my experience has been mostly positive. with quick books based upon the fact that i only use the basic service for sending out invoices. biggest problems have been not being able to sign in a couple of times and having had both good and bad experiences with help desk personnel. i use 2 accounting apps. square, which i run all cash, credit cards, gift cards and tax based revenue through. quick books is only used for my non-taxable customers who get invoices and pay by check. this keeps things simple for me as square is hardly ever any problem and i have workarounds with quick books when problems arise. since qb handles no money for me they cannot hold my business hostage at any time. and since both programs have numerous reports this also makes my tax requirements easy. however, one other thing i dislike about qb online is their constantly changing the program. everyone likes their apps kept up to date but i hate when they change things just for the sake of touting “look we made another improvement “
ammmmazing. this app is great !! only thing missing is appointment capabilities other than that the app is perfect.everything i need out of the office.
user. good app but needs more features
paid app. app costs 8.99 a month
not available?. i need this app to work with my uk quickbooks account that handles multiple currencies. the iphone app is at least functional but lacking many features.
so simple and quick to use. i have downloaded the app and have been using it for my self employed hairdressing. it is so easy to use and because i use my phone often it's great to pick it up at the end of the day and track my takings in which means i never have to worry about not being up to date. i would highly recommend this to anyone who wants an easy and simple way to keep detailed accounts!
great app. so easy a caveman can do it
loads of bugs since updating to ios 13. broken links. can’t call up customer information. dashboard only shows banking information. invoices and estimates haven’t saved when generated on mobile device.
great compliment to qb online. been using qb for over 10 years. recently switched to online and added this app. amazing ease of use and highly functional.
ipad app. please update your app to be more like the desktop version...i can not track inventory received through the ipad app i purchased and ipad pro hoping to do away with my laptop and so far its been seamless, except for this app not being able to track inventory received. i hope your developers can figure this out before my 8 year old laptop crashes! thanks
updates have made it horrible. i love using the online version. the august updates however have tanked the app. it is no longer sharing information between my iphone, ipad, and mac. the sorting feature of estimates is now gone ( pending, accepted, closed) it only shows in last changed order, not good when working with 3 month or longer history. on a positive note, i do like the photo modification for the iphone. it no longer adds to my photo album, just imports to quickbooks.
good app but could be better. overall i love the app. i've been using my ipad pro for traveling more but we need this app up to speed. in sales view i would love a simple addition to show next to the invoice if it was sent, opened or not sent. it's a simple change and would save a lot of time instead of having to open up each invoice. also, would like to see a total amount of outstanding invoices at the top, not just divided out in overdue and due. i'd also like in sales view to be able to sort by po number and invoice number. would also be nice to have a note icon next to each invoice number that if we click on it, it opens to show the notes we wrote. another note that i have been requesting on all quickbooks online apps for a while now is the feature the billings app used to have for free. a simple list of all the clients emails for that particular company in a list with a check box next to each. we can select our repeats to automatically select those for estimates and invoices. but we can easily click to add others or remove them. it helps so much to have all of those email addresses for each specific client to select from. currently, we have to go in to the clients info page and add the email there or go and copy / paste it into my email. both do not seem very organized were thought out for an app it's expensive considering the free app you took over had it before. plenty of large companies just bringing freelancers or they have different people handling billing. we need a faster, simpler solution to select company email addresses foe each estimate/invoice. please address these issues. if so i will change my rating to five for sure but right now there is room for improvement.
hate it. accounting manually with a ledger would be quicker than this program. i officially hate this program and will be changing to another accounting software in july. i have been using quickbooks since 2000 and used to love its simplicity but it has become time consuming and harder to use. make a mistake...can't fix it. if you are away you can't access all the features using the app - you have to find a computer and log on. app is garbage and pay run screen won't scroll so you can't edit anything like hours worked, for example. reckon looks like a really good alternative. maybe quickbooks should have consulted keychain when they developed the app. if you thinking of quickbooks for your business...don't do it! every employee of quickbooks must have given this a 5 star review.
more than annoyed..... new update: 8-9-16, still have to enter my password every time i open the app. touch id or app pin- what is that??? 🤔 this is so annoying.... especially in front of customers!! tired of wasting my time. i've deleted and re-installed the app to no avail. it appears you guys are never going to get it right....
nice app. nice app, quick and easy. smart invoices and bank matches. i don't like paypal, so wouldn't use that payment option.
poor excuse for a very expensive app. for as expensive as their subscription service is, i expect much better from their mobile app. at current, about one out of every two photos for expenses disappears right after i take it. also, you can't bill an expense to a client via the app even if you have the overpriced subscription package that supports that function. i don't really use the app for anything else as i do all invoicing from the web interface (yes the desktop app for mac is just as bad as the iphone one). lastly, using it only one week i've already had an instance where the app didn't sync properly and lost some expense inputs. you can tell quickbooks is resting lazily at their position of industry lead.
terrible package. i’ll be cancelling your app and the account i had with you for two years after finding out you’ve doubled my monthly subscription without any notice what so ever, i agree with an inflation rise yearly but a100% rise is just robbery, i’ll make sure this goes far and wide. the damn app never works , can’t connect my bank and it shuts down several times a day for critical updates. back to sage for me i think this system is full of issues
fantastic product and app!. i'm one of those guys that doesn't post reviews a lot. but quickbooks online (qbo) has really helped my wife with her business! i've seen other posters on qbo forums say that qbo lacks advanced functions or that it's clunky. but for my wife's art school business, this product shines! we can quickly create invoices, send them for electonic payment online & everything reconciles neatly. she can accept credit card payments on-site with the merchant account and invoices look professional. business bank accounts can be linked also! built in basic reports have customization options. i can go on and on!
there’s just 1 thing... i have been loving the way this program functions. the only thing i continually wish for is that i would be notified when a customer opens an estimate, not just the invoice.
awesome!. this is app is like a holy grail! ‼️🙌🏾 it works really well with my iphone too💙💙
bad customer service and bad app. i’m use only one month is the most terrible app. never used this app
no grouping of customers or invoices. services that the regular version have.... i don't know why they didn't carry this over. if u have more than one customer base or if u need to send the same invoice to multiple customers you are out of luck. hope they fix soon very annoying
if you have an issue reload the app.. that fixed my problem and it works great now.
"new ""update"" totally crashes - it only gets worse!. i personally like the ipad app better than the online version for interface, but it has so many bugs! constantly gives me error message that i'm not authorized to do something (add/edit a customer, etc.), but then it lets me do it. but i keep having to close out all the error messages that pop up. often won't let me email an invoice. won't let me add customer off of creating a new estimate (have to add customer, close, then do estimate and choose customer again). the list of basic things that should not be an issue goes on and on. on the iphone app, there is no place for my reps to view the contact person's name at the company! i'm sure there are other things i could think of, but i've just learned to compensate and work around things. however an app with this many bugs should not be out there - it's pretty pathetic! update 11/18/15 - after update, all the previous bugs are still there. pathetic to issue an update and not fix what was wrong! update 1/14/16 - even worse! now i can no longer add an item to an estimate or see the customer name on estimates or invoices under ""activity"". what is wrong with you people? if you can't make it better, leave it alone! now it is completely useless! update 11/7/16 - i absolutely hate you for forcing me to upgrade to ios 9!!! i have been suffering with quickbooks ipad's pathetic bugs for well over a year. i am forced to use it for my job because my laptop is old and i hardly ever pull it out anymore. everything i do is on my ipad. however, i have an older model (not by years, but by model) and after the mess updating to ios 8.3 created for me, i vowed i would never update again! none of the other apps on my ipad have forced me to do this. app developers are generally sensitive to the fact that not everyone chooses to disrupt their life by updating their device and spending days having to learn to use it all over again (and deal with whatever new bugs it brings to the table). you must have the absolutely lowest level of developers out there who first, couldn't fix even simple bugs in your app (like telling me every time i set up a customer or did an estimate ""i wasn't authorized to do it"" and then warning me if i got out of it all data would be lost. but it wasn't and everything i did was still in the system. even our boss got this message and she is the administrator). there were a myriad of other quirks we had to work around and now your solution is to release a new version, but in so doing force everyone to upgrade to ios 9 because your developers weren't smart enough to know how to make it work with previous ios versions??? shame on you! you would get 0 stars in my review if i could and if this new version isn't totally bug free, you will really hear from me! 6/28/17 - so a month ago i finally successfully upgraded my ipad 2 to ios 9.3.5, which is the last version it will update to. i did this in order to be able to use qb on my ipad. it had its occasional crashes and freezes, as always, but otherwise was working ok until today. suddenly, total crash and won't open at all. i've uninstalled, hard reboot, and reinstalled several times to no avail. then checked the app store and see they did an ""update"" yesterday. typical. they just cannot seem to leave well enough alone. the thing has bugs and flaws enough, but they only seem to be able to make it worse, not better. it is unbelievable that a company like qb cannot hire a better technical support staff to develop their apps. my company is planning on switching to another software soon and i am so glad!"
amazing app to accompany an amazing program. i've been using quickbooks online along with the app for over a year. my business has never been more organized in regards to accounting. being able to access all of my information from my phone is a game changer. will give the app 5 stars when they implement a way to move items once added to an estimate/invoice.
very good. good job i would like to add pictures to the estimates i would like to see a calendar with all the jobs and i would like to drag them to change it to a different date
long time user, good goals poor implementation.. this is not full quickbooks if your a long term user, it has select features only. maybe one day it will get there but it's not there yet. business owners beware. i've been using this for about a year. i switched to the online platform from local user so i could use it on my different devices while in the field and keep everything in sync in the cloud. i had also hoped to allow my technicians in the field to enter their time online without using a third-party service anymore. although the concept is wonderful the actual service is below par at best. but it is slowly getting better. pros: - online sync, when you're on the internet it will sync with the cloud most of the time. (not always). - the ability to make a estimate on the fly and then accept a payment is fantastic. - ability to add vendors on the fly - ability to sync with your accountant online. (read cons) - ability to update a invoice in the field and send it to your client. - ability to have your team log time online, additional services required. - words with a lot of existing intuit services, i.e. bill.com cons: - it only works when you're online!!! - beware it makes your primary system completely useless if you're off-line. they claim this is not a issue. i can tell you from lots of experience and multiple calls to their technical support team it is completely a known issue. - you can't do everything on the mobile or ipad pro as they claim or even half the features of the laptop version. - accountant support has increase, since switching to the online version i have had to double the amount of meetings with my full-time accountant to keep things working like normal. it provides a easy to share system with your accountant which they keep updating about once a month. maybe they'll get it right this month! - check your bank support first! i had to switch banks because when quickbooks updated their online system last year they made it completely unusable with certain credit unions in the sf bay area. - i have been charged 3x for the same service, monthly, yearly and monthly again. so watch your intuit charges. although it has its issues overall it does work pretty well in general. but it has about 30% of the features of your old full quickbooks! if you love your quickbooks it's not ready to switch over yet.
needs to improve. i've used qb for years but this is the first time i've used the online version. best bit for me is the storage of receipts and invoices in the cloud and the ability to enter expenses on the app. as i'm away a lot that feature is excellent. the invoicing feature is good as well. the not so good bit..... why can't you enter bills via the app?? i get bills when i'm away in the same way i issue invoice and pay for expenses so why not bills. it means i have to remember them when i get home which sometimes doesn't happen. the app requires an internet connection to function so when not have an offline function so you can record expenses for instancewhich would then upload when a connection was available.
average. like the app when it works. every so often there's a glitch. and it takes time for them to fix. customer service just can't help.
ok but needs work. we have 4 ipad2 running his app to invoice and do estimates on the go. much better and faster than previous versions. would still like to see some type of service form so we can make multiple service calls on a project then tally up and invoice together. also the new activity page doesn't show sent info on invoices and estimates. that was very helpful. they should put it back in. overall better.
junk. this app is an embarrassment to use. doesn't attach correct to emails, rude default email tags, and prints too light to fax. i used qb contractor for 10 years before being talked into ipad by apple as the way to go mobile. save your money do things right. this freezes up a lot too which if you have time to wait may be for you.
super functional..extremely helpful. quick books app is fantastic! makes using my phone for invoicing and estimates very easy! recommend to anyone..... no glitches, no hang ups..... you won't be disappointed!
what a joke.. if you are moving from qb desktop, think again! there's not even an easy way to just view today's business. no reports in app. useless.
"quickbooks customer service is atrocious. i run a small business. i did all my invoicing and accounting through quickbooks. i paid for 14 months for this service. now i have to find a new service, reload all my client data for over a couple years, all the items that were saved as line items for invoicing and other things as well. here's the story: customer for over a year. my credit card gets stolen. no big deal. there is a 6 day lapse in payment while my new card is in the mail. i update my itunes account and make sure all of my subscriptions are paid and current. the app proceeds for 2 weeks to tell me that i don't have a subscription anymore and eventually locks me out. the app will not sync with itunes to see my paid subscription. i spent an hour on the phone with apple, they can't do anything. i spent 2 hours on the phone with quickbooks for them almost verbatim to tell me that if i don't cancel my subscription on itunes and pay directly to them (it's $3 more a month) that it'll never work again and that ""while we want your business you don't have enough of a history for us to do anything"". i call apple back and after an hour on the phone they refund me two months, tell me to file a dispute for the last year with my credit card company, report the app and write my experience in the apps review section. stay far, far, far away from this company. they are awful and i will make sure that i tell everyone i can to stay far away from them as well."
disappointing app. you can’t really do anything productive in this application. it’s extremely limited in functionality.
what a life saver. i needed something to simplify the data input that comes with invoicing and dealing with the piles of receipts with the flexibility of not having to open up my laptop to do so every time. when i saw a promotion to try out quickbooks online with ability to have access on mobile devices i figured i'd give it a try. it's been a life saver. my account transferred seamlessly and quickly. it eliminated having to manually enter my credit card purchases and bank account transactions because you can link those accounts right to quickbooks and they update automatically. i can take pictures of receipts right from my phone or ipad and take care of them immediately as well as emailing invoices or recording payments received right from my phone or ipad. it's great having this ability on the go. so far i've discovered that i do have to log onto the website directly to get more detailed/specific reports, but it's possible i just haven't learned how to do it yet via the app. thanks for simplifying my life in this aspect anyway. hoping it makes tax season a little easier.
adequate at best. once again i have found that intuit turns out an adequate, but overpriced product. i have used qb as a desktop products for years, never totally satisfied, but not willing to endure switching to something else. on my migration from windows to mac, i learn i must shift to qb online. i select essentials as my needs are, i thought, minimal. to my surprise essentials will not allow tracking of expenses by customer, something i thought essential but not intuit. to get that i would need to upgrade to plus for another $20 a month. if you can use something do. update: the product believe it not is getting worse.
the best way to manage business. i love it and i can control how i ran the business easy and fast way to keep track of my expenses and income
great app!. our company switched from quickbooks desktop to the online version which came with the option to download the app. we now use the app more than online. we handle estimates, invoices, payments, banking and more directly in the app and on the go. the app has a simple and clean look making it easy to navigate. to date we haven't had any issues with it. we are excited to finally be able to get things done in less time!
waste of valuable time.. all i wanted was a simple app to send 1 (one) out of state customer an invoice at the end of the month. my other 2 (two) customers don't really need one. took an hour to set it up and a couple more to figure out i was declined. just wanted something simple.
many bugs. need to fix bugs that cause the app to not follow the regular online access. employees can see things they shouldn't (like business income) and are unable to do things they should like entering customer info and invoices.
works better on android phones. i had a android phone and tablet before and the programs works better than apple app and i say that because i change to apple and when i use the program on apple i am limited on what i can do when updating quotes and invoices i don’t have the option to add items or replace one that it already exists i can only remove that line the only way i can add something new is at the bottom line and i don’t want it there so for that i give it 3 other than that the program works fine but when you need that option to update with out having to redo everything from scratch or use a old quote as a template is a important factor fix it and i will give it 5 star
money making on the move. every version gets better and better. i almost exclusively use the iphone app for all my billing and banking needs. so happy i switched years ago and no longer have to wait to get back to the office to bill the clients. i get paid right away, credit cards and all. thanks qb.
owner. i actually have never written a review for an app, and i've had an every iphone since the 3gs, i read the first review for this app and was so disgusted at the panning i just had to write one in support. i have a small business and use this every day! it's great, well designed and very user friendly. i run a carpet cleaning company and run basically every part of my business with this app.
inferior to qb online on desktop. qb app on ipad or android does not not have even half of the features that qb online has on a desktop. i can manage basic invoicing, basic expenses, see transactions, and pull up basic reports... everything about this app is basic. i have to actually be on my desktop to access the full features of qb online. very dissapointed.
not as good as desktop. needs to be able to do more with employees and checking invoices and managing the dashboard
terrible app. half the time i can not download my banking info, i can not do invoices. it’s junk for what you have to pay for it. i’m finding something new.
i can’t look at invoices?. the app is ok. i have basic access to customers and their address and number. but when i go into a customer and try to look for an invoice it isn’t there. it’s nowhere to be found?! extremely frustrating!
love it so easy to use.. what a great app simple to use and the support is there if you need. would differently recommend it to anyone who runs a small business.
not suitable. not happy with this app and it won't let me cancel it! help!
great for small business owners.. awesome app. very convenient and keeps the finances and work orders organized. takes some trial and error but well worth the effort to learn this system. you tube has many instructional videos on how to expedite learning this program. price is reasonable for what you get. don't hesitate to get it. if anything you will learn something.
very useful and convenient ever ready business tool. i was a little sceptical about migrating from paper and spreadsheet records for our small company accounts. our accountant advised the move and it has been a huge success. easy capture of expenses and bank transactions, instant views of the business via the dashboard are not powerful and easy to use. some things are a little confusing for the non-accountant, but the user interface has steadily been improving over the 18months we have been using the online system and the apps.
does not support accounting functions. quickooks is first and foremost an accounting application. this app does not provide for reviewing financial statements, reviewing expense categories (ie cost of goods sold, office expense, etc) and does not allow correction of mis- applied expense items. from an accounting and control viewpoint, i think it is almost useless
book keeping made easy. with constant updates this is the go to program for my business! this app assists in daily activity and allows me to be on the move.
app is crap. the quickbooks app very rarely lets us sign in and when it does many of the functions do not work. i’ve contacted customer service which is a complete joke. their suggestion was to check out the message board to see who else may have the problem we have! why? how about fix the problem!
rave. i have enjoyed having customer information at my fingertips on this app.
poor app not intuitive. some features are good, but (and it is a big but), the desktop app does not work, the web app is poor and the iphone app almost forces you to make errors, which you can't seem to undo. this is a waste of money. if the app were more intuitive and flexible then you'd have a winner. for now you won't be putting accountants or spreadsheets of business.
good app. very detailed , im no pro @ accounting but i am teaching myself this app. its very in depth and i like it.
great app. helps make my business more efficient. this is a great tool for small business owners who are on the go. making invoices, estimates and tracking expenses with my iphone helps make things much more efficient. i wish there was a way to track hst, and generate simple reports within the app. automatic text recognition would be an awesome feature as well.
horrible. what a joke. all i want to do is be able to go to my online account. every time i try to do that it pops up to install this app. i did. now when i go in nothing looks the same or works the same. you would think i would be able to go online without this horrible app. i would give it zero stars if i could.
perfect for a small consulting firm. this app is everything i need for my consulting firm. easy to use and easy to keep track of expenses on the road. invoicing is a breeze. love the data in the cloud. take a pic and throw away those receipts! works flawlessly between my pc, mac, ipad and iphone. only gripe is the ipad & phone versions are not as similar as one would expect.
excellent. i love the immediate accessibility of our business's financial position. no need for me to meet with the bookkeeper and accountant nearly as often. i haven't had any issues with the app.
excellent. the app is a great supplement to the online version when i'm on the road. i easily make customer invoices, add expenses that i have purchased. nothing is lost or forgotten. great way to keep everything up to date
love it, but. i love the app, but different devices have different functions. some things i have to do on the laptop. the internet version will crash and i have to reload it. not sure if its my internet connection or not. it is helping me get more organized and ready for 04/15/16, ugh!
so far so good. really like the new version of quick books. i like the ability to work on invoices while on the phone through the app. has made billing so much easier than the old check system. but even then, when we do get checks, easy to process. only hang up is journal entries. i used to love working of the gl and posting accounts and the online and app version of qb is just not as functional.
missing features from qb online. i use qb for invoicing and purchase orders, and i only work from my ipad. couple of things: you can’t create a po on the app—i have to sign in to qb online and it’s still very buggy. i’ve lost about 3 pos so far during random refresh times, when qb “invites” me to try the app...completing a task that is unavailable on the app. this is also frustrating as i pay for qb pro—why can’t i have all the features on the app? second: i like to personalize my emails with the invoices; i have noticed that sometimes it accepts my changes and sometimes it does not. the default “here is your invoice!” is a little too cheerful/juvenile for clients to whom i am sending 2nd, 3rd invoices, and too impersonal for clients who are receiving their initial bill. app would receive 5 stars if i could do both of these things reliably.
i love quickbooks online. i love quickbooks online & my accountant does also. this app is really good for doing your expenses on but as far as invoicing i still do it on the computer. it's very handy for a small business. the fact you can enter an expense, take a picture of the receipt & go on your merry way. i'm sold.
dreadful just unusable plus desktop version same. started well. then couldn’t input expenses on the app. hard and long winded to get support. now cant enter invoices and reciepts on desktop version!! totally pointless package and when you have r pugh troubles running your own business!!!!! think i will go back to my accountant and just dump everything with him each month as the hours this is costing me plus unbelievable stress!!!!
won't open. this app won't open. don't waste your time.
i love quickbooks!. i own multiple businesses and i use quickbooks online in each one of them. the quickbooks team does an excellent job in making sure that we are up and running 100% of the time and they have always quickly fixed bugs that may arise and are continually adding in new requested features. i think there are still some bells and whistles we would like to see added, such as a digital signature capture, but we are very pleased with our purchase and experience.
"it doesn't synchronize. the app is totally unusable. it doesn't synchronize customers and supplier and the transaction with those missing from the list result as incomplete. tried also to dis install and reinstall: same story. on top of this it must also said that the assistance is unresponsive, many days and repeated enquiries to finally get emails full of irritating smileys and useless answers like ""we are constantly improving the apps to serve our mobile customers""."
roy. great for on the go work. would be even better if you could request payment from the app. (ipn) then you get a 10 star.
good good good. awesome program. everything you need to operate a small business. the ipad app is incredible. couldn't ask for more! we have been using qb for over 5 years. invoices and estimates on the go with ease/pay vendors/print checks/ manage expenses/ no sever or computer needed as its cloud based/ with the right accountant who knows what their doing he/she can have an accountant log in. unbelievable! and fantastic for around 30 bucks a month! who could ask for more..? some minor glitches with the phone app. overall 4 and 1/2 stars. would recommend to any small business!
"excellent for really small businesses. i'm a sole prop and this app is perfect for me. with a business that is mostly services-based (and no payroll), this app gives me exactly what i need in terms of creating and editing invoices and quick reports. a lot of people are complaining about the lack of reports, and maybe that's true for larger businesses, but being able to quickly see income and expenses is all i need ""on the go."" it's supposed to be a helpful app - not the entire quickbooks system. if i want in depth reports i go to the actual computer. not a problem."
has potential. i'm not i fully understand why quickbooks is the worlds leading software for small business accounting. i'm dying for customizations for my invoices and estimates. these updates should work like a wysiwyg editor; immediate updates. desperately need more room for customizations on the invoices as well; they look like they are from 1995. the mobile app is ok, could be great. some things are not where you expect them to be but i guess i just have to learn that.
functional. easy. efficient. beautiful.. what more can i say? i am an independent film producer that is often out of the office. i prefer this app to the web version on my laptop. wow! this app alone makes the purchase of my iphone 7plus worth every dime.
can't attach images or accept signatures. really!!?? so many features i would have expected. track expenses, milage, accept signatures.
mobile app. convenient.
business. i'm very happy with this app help me a lot
great app. very good app to manage quickbooks when you are away from your desk.
needing improvements after more than a year. the app is good for entering transactions and it does this poorly. you have to perform searches which are cumbersome. despite the fact on mobile i have entered transactions for only five vendors, it shows a list of the vendors with whom have transacted business with the most for the last 15 years. this app only does a fraction of what the full online app can do.
missing features. it would great if it could read data from receipts and auto fills the fields. i can't get my clients to use the app, because re silt entry is too cumbersome. reports are lacking.
awful. iphone app pretty much unusable in the real world. always wants to be signed in each time you open it, touch id feature doesn't work. today it's complaining the app needs to be updated before i use it, it then directs me to the app store where it shows i already have the latest version!
update killed app for me!. used to love this app as i’m a paid subscriber, but the recent update doesn’t launch anymore. i’ve tried removing and reinstalling same result. iphone x.
one of the worst decisions ever!. i decided to move forward with quick books because of a friend recommending it to me. this has been one of the worst experiences ever. the customer service is terrible and the fact that quick books owes me money is even worst. i highly recommend that no one uses this service.
where is the cost of the app?. where is the cost of the app. you gave me all kind of information but not the price of the app!!???
great app. this is a great app for small businesses.
quickbooks. it's a great app.
great small business app. i've been using it for a year and it has made my life so much easier. customers can pay progressively. i log on 20-30x a day for inputting expenses, billing customers, creating quick estimates and i have never had it not work for me. although it is very expensive combined with quickepay (quickens version of the square reader)
doesn’t work. i have an iphone 8 and all of a sudden this app stops working. i call quickbooks and they can’t fix it. they closed the case in one day. don’t walk away from this company, run away.
dissapointed. this is the frontline of my business as i am a mobil service technician. app no longer will save or complete an invoice. this is crippling my business! fixxxxxx please immediately!
superb. the app on the iphone is great. works perfectly and great for quick invoicing. the ipad app is even better as provides much more in depth information. even better both apps work seamlessly with each other. don't know what i would do without this app.
would be better if i could manage payroll on the app. i would love to be able to do up my company’s payroll on the fly if i’m out on a job site or on a business trip. please fix this
love this app!. i absolutely love this app. it allows me to run my business efficiently and effectively!
excellent for small biz and freelancers. as a freelance artist who travels a lot, this app (plus online access) suit all of my accounting needs. easy to follow after you've learned the basics, and love doing my monthly books while on the subway. has clients and books all in one place. helpful to see who owes money and to track income flows across each year. all the reports are fantastic. best accounting software out there, worth the investment imo.
love the app, but price is too high. i love the app, but when will the price increases stop. as soon as i have time to research other programs i will cancel my subscription. $40 per month is too much to just invoice customers and reconcile my bank statement.
app barely compatible with computer. the the features on the app and computer barely cross over and i can never find customers on the app that i have on my computer so i have to jump back and forth to make things work.
great app. this app is great and easy to use
customer search bar is gone. i can’t search for clients when i’m in the app. now i have to search and click in the left letters to get close to their name. i’m not able to search by phone number either. i’m very disappointed they made this change
lacking. this app has potential, but it's lacking. especially the fact that you cannot make deposits on the mobile app, only on the desktop version.
update needed. for the past three weeks has not been tracking the miles. otherwise a 5 star app when working properly.
terrible product and now doesn't even connect. previous reviews are on the money, this app is terribly crippled on ipad and mobile. to make it worse some days, like today i can't even connect to do these limited tasks. intuit please wake up before you get rolled over like blackberry!!!
awesome app. it's very user friendly and informative. i really like how easy it is to assign an expense category and the convenient display of the profit / loss feature.
like the app but need update for iphone 6 plus. app and software work well for my business but i was disappointed that the app on a iphone 6 plus is just magnified from the 5s. i really hoped it was a scaled ipad experience. really... no landscape mode?
less than worthless to me. who cares what customers are near me! i want to see banking information, view various account in qb, do real work on my ipad. i should be able to do anything on this i can do using qq online. should is the operative word here. don't waste your time and space on your ipad.
how come i cant make pos on the app?. this should have this ability built-in.
limited. for alot of the functionality of qbo you need to use the web app anyway so i would not bother with this app.
stopped working after the update. this was working great until the software update last week. now i end up creating multiple copies of invoices and estimates and the app just freezes on the saving screen. i can only finish off by logging in through a web browser and completing the task. please fix this fast intuit!
waste of time!. total waste of time. i like the cd version than the online version. i hope intuit will try to combine the app to include all the features that are on the software version. i am a landscaper and my office needs to be with me outside, not stuck in an office. i need a program where i can take my work with me to my job site. so, when i meet my customers i can give them an an estimate right away on the spot and be able to email to them write away or be able have my customers sign the estimate right away. i would also like do the same with my invoices. it would make it so much easier to count all the footage and labour at the work site - that i don't forget anything and the homeowners can count with me too. on top, i can complete my invoice on the job site and be able to send it to my customers right away. the ipad is much lighter to carry then carrying a laptop. more people are choosing the laptop over the desktop for convenience, in the same way, one day people are going to choose the ipad over the laptop. i hope quickbooks can bring that future now. i just would like to be able to make my invoices and estimates at a job site, where ever that is, and basically be able to edit it and send it to my customers and have my customers sign my estimates on the job site and fix the deal. also i would like to be able to enter in my customers payment right away so i don't have to wait tell i get into the office and then enter that in. as well as, have that information on my app be able to easily transfer to my computer when i am able to get into the office. thanks, but quickbooks should be thanking me because i just showed your companies future -should be headed this way if it is not already thinking of this idea!
excellent app. easy to use. makes record keeping on the go a snap.
don’t use this with an ipad.. bought this app and was unable to get it to work with an ipad. 4 hours on the phone with this company and still no success. they charged me and told me to get my money back through apple. there is an open known problem being worked on their end but user’s beware. you won’t find out until you’ve paid.
love this app. works great and i can navigate and make invoices and track everything in one app! i love it
business owner. i've used quickbooks desktop software for years and have loved using the product and greatly value their customer service. top rate. i wanted to start accepting credit card payments and thought the mobility of the online version would be an added plus which it was. problem was, the last thing i needed was to learn a whole new accounting software program in the middle of starting up a new business. it works nothing like the desktop version and everything is buried in cryptic icon or menus buried in layers of menus. you have to search for everything which for me was not intuitively laid out. if you understand accounting and how balance sheets/income statements/journals are set up this system will try you patience and knowledge at every turn. going back to the desktop version and using intuits go payment option which i wasn't informed about when i looked into the mobile version. i also working in an area without high speed internet service which greatly compromises the effectiveness of the software.
down graded. from april this app is unusable. i down graded to qb online. it appears it was released about a year too soon. nothing but frustration from day one. the phone app is all but useless.
great & up-to-date!. this is a great little app to give you access into the back end of your quickbooks online account. great for doing simple invoicing and adding expenses. i still use the desktop browser for more complicated reports and such. well done and intuit keeps the app up to date thank you!
contractor couldn't live without it. i use this app every time i bill a client and can provide him with an accurate, complete invoice and receive payment on the spot. importing customers from my contacts is a great help. a must-have complement to quickbooks online.
headed in the right direction, but needs work.. this is a good app, with many great features. i use it to write quick estimates, or edit estimates written from my computer. however, there are a two major drawbacks 1. multi user doesn't seem to be an option. im hanging in for now to see what happens but if this isn't changed soon then i will be looking elsewhere. 2. they don't seem to understand who the app is made for. is this for tue small business owner, accounting, felid opps? i can write estimates from it so that seems like accounting is out, but not all the banking is available via mobile either. that leads me to say this app for the small, one person, business. i plan on growing...so what do i do then? please don't get me wrong this is a good app. i just feel they need to get a focus group on this app, and figure it out. i would like to see multi user support, with areas that each user can be limited to using. basically management, field, accounting, and even inventory to some degree could be using this system.
"dissapointing. used to love this ap. but it has been garbage for some time now. takes forever to login and load on my iphone (even slower on my ipad). once you are finally in adding new customers or saving estimates is just as bad. have called customer support to find out what is going on and received the response ""we know about the issue and we are working on it"". this was over two months ago. i was added to their escalation list and have yet to receive an update. horrible customer service. actively looking for a different direction for our business."
updates. need more updates on the apps because i always have to go to my laptop to do certain things not like in that
awesome app. this is a brilliant app. i have all my invoices and expenses at my fingertips. very easy to use and synchs perfectly with qbo on my mac. keeps me on track with daily reminders of overdue invoices. no one gets away with not paying me now.
limited features in the app. the app has extremely limited features as compared to web cant send customer statements or edit recurring transactions or match partially paid invoices.
best in the business!. im a general contractor, tracking and allocating expenses is easy, i take a picture of the receipts with my phone and stays stored in the cloud, really cool. i like it a lot
no bill?. come on, we can do all things with expense and nothing with bills? bills are the big part of our business expenses from our vendors. they are not even added to the total expense on the summary dashboard, how can we really tell how our business is doing when a big chunk of cost not appearing? please include the ability to enter/view/edit bills asap.
great product. i like this app. can use from just about anywhere
not good. app and site are actually kind of bad. slow to load. not enough options. will try xero soon
i need to actually work!. this would be an awesome app if i could do more than just send estimates and invoices. there are other tasks that need to be done and it would be really helpful if you could do everything that you can do online.
quickbooks saves me time & money. this app has streamlined my business as i am always on the go. its easy, efficient and powerful! still missing critical features in international version such as online paypal payments
awesome app!. best way to keep your finances organized!
no support - update. update: last year the screwed up my account just before tax time, see below. now with the latest update i am once again being told my subscription does not exist even though i paid for the whole year. and once again, i am unable to access critical features or anything useful in the app just before tax time. i begin to think this is a scam. previous: i loved this app until there was an issue with my subscription. i was locked out of the app when the payment processed a weekend late. intuit says apple has to fix it. apple says intuit has to fix it. intuit says they will contact apple then contact me, the sound of crickets rings through the house. it has been almost a month, no one has fixed it. meanwhile, i have no way to modify invoices, update my budget, bill, or track sales because the app asks me to subscribe in order to do anything but login. when i push the check subscription button, it confirms that i have one then logs me out and the dance begins again. best part: apple won't refund the subscription for the month only stop it for next month and intuit says they cannot refund anything, so i am paying them to be locked out. this is no way to run a business. no way to retain consumer confidence. and after the new year i will be using something else. it is a great app, until it breaks.
slow at the app not compatible with ipad. something wrong with this app , slowly uploading and not easily manageable on the ipad
keeps crashing. update: it’s still crashing. i can’t upload any receipts from my phone. 🤬 what’s the point of using it if i can’t upload my receipts! every time i try to upload a receipt from my phone, it crashes when i press save & doesn’t save at all. i’ve tried closing the app & trying again, but it does it every time, so basically i can’t take a picture of any receipt & upload it. please fix! update: i still can’t upload a receipt unless i take a picture of it elsewhere & upload vs taking a picture of it on the app.
stops working too often!. not a bad way to do your estimates in the field and send out invoices but your app stops working way too often for us company wide!!!
epic help. this app is very helpful for me it is very good
please: give us delayed charge already!. how many times do we have to ask? for the love of gawd, why can i not add a delayed charge on the mobile app?????? this is something you actually want to do when you're at a client, not get them to sign for an invoice every time you visit them during the month.
very beneficial app. this is a very beneficial app. it does not replace the pc version but is an excellent aid. it's helpful to send invoices on the go or at the end of a service call. the sooner the customer gets invoice the more chance i have of getting paid. it is a very good aid!
"online is the only relevant version for today's small to medium business.. we originally bought 2015 pro with payroll and were very disappointed when we realized that it was not accessible remotely. who makes a product today that has ""pro"" in the name, but is not mobile!?! anyways, after loading all of our information, invoices, expenses and customer information; we realized its limitations. after calling qb, we decided to move to qb online. qb online has a much better and easier to use interface then qb pro. it was easy to load everything on to it, create invoices, document and categorize expenses, and see reporting. this will be the version that we stay with."
handy and convenient.. i love this app. it is easy to use and always have it all at office when you go to do bookkeeping there. reports may be something to add so i could we what customer owe me. thx
app is glitching. ever since the new update to the quickbooks mobile app, it has been glitching every time i try to open the app. every time i click the app it closes by itself. it's frustrating whenever i have to log anything in the app. i have to constantly delete the app and reinstall it for it to work properly again.
very good for business!. quickbooks is a great app for managing the everyday finances for my business that i just start. no matter what is a small business, this is the right one.
very good app. easy to use. recommended!
new app is great!. the new app is super user friendly and versatile. it’s easier to use quickbooks from my phone than it is from my pc now. vast improvement over the previous versions.
works well so far. i installed the app this month. so far it allows me the flexibility to record transactions on the go. this is a big help.
i love quickbooks online. i love quickbooks online & my accountant does also. this app is really good for doing your expenses on but as far as invoicing i still do it on the computer. it's very handy for a small business. the fact you can enter an expense, take a picture of the receipt & go on your merry way. i'm sold.
a really great app. quick books is pretty much all you could ask for when running a small business. it's online so all information and invoices are accessible from any device with internet. great customisable options. only minor thing is its interface is slightly more complex than other apps/programs but once you know your way around your fine.
doesn't work. app doesn't sync all data with quickbooks online. i see only my company name and customer list. no invoices, expenses etc. intuit support we're not able to help.
pretty good. got an ipad so i could use qbo on the run because i found out pretty quickly the app on my iphone was useless for my needs. loved using my ipad until i tried to print invoices. wouldn't work which was aggravating since i had time constraints. i had to wait until i was at my computer to take care of it. i had been using qb mac desktop and was very happy until qb told me i had to switch before the os upgraded. there have been a lot of glitches along the way with the online program. i must say customer support has been awesome. if they can't fix the problem they suggest letting the engineers know so they can take the suggestions and make changes. basically, qb online is a work in progress.
excellent app. couldnt ask for more! all my paperwork centralised in my pocket!
they screwed up logging in with pin. i used to have to type my full password in only every few days. now it's several times a day. why even have the option to use a pin if it only works a couple times. i contacted them through the app but got no response.
great for small business and photographers. we have had this for a few years and use the web, desktop and mobile app almost daily. (for mac/iphone) everything is flawless and the customer service is great! glenn fajota photography
i should have read reviews. i have used qb for over 10 yrs now and my desktop version is going to be out dated soon. i thought i would try the online system because my business is a travel service. i'm hoping this will help redirect my time (less on qb at my desk). i signed up for the trial. download everything i need and set my business up on my pc, then downloaded the app to my phone. logged in on my phone and the downloaded crashed 3 times. i tried it again and went to bed to let it do it download, in the morning i checked and it still had not loaded completely. i had to turn off my wifi and use my data. then it popped up and said there was a error.... not a good start for something that is supposed to make things easier for my business. not very stable!! (day 1 of 30 day trial).
helpful app. massively scaled down from the quickbooks online browser version. but it is not intended to be a full service app. it gives a good, quick, and simple snapshot of your business on the go. it also is easy to add expenses and take pictures of receipts from within the app itself. i find it helpful on the go. worth downloading for sure
nothing works for me. nothing works for me with this app. if i login using desktop, qbo is ok but when i use the app, there is no information; no clients, no invoices, nothing. the subscription says i have a free trial until 2037. phone support was unsuccessful.
nice and easy to use. i have try this app. as a startup owner, it is very good to generate estimate & invoice
not as god as desktop or web access. i’ve been using quickbooks online for over a year and while it’s ok, it’s really lacking in a lot of areas. also, the mobile app can not perform a variety of common tasks that the computer app and web interface can do. for instance, i cannot edit certain invoices on mobile if they have expenses included. once an expense is added to an invoice, only the desktop app or web interface can edit it. also, as many have said, if you’re used to the traditional quickbooks pc or mac software which has been available for many years, the hosted version can be difficult to adjust to. it’s not capable of everything the older software can do, and a separate paid subscription is required for every company file you maintain. i am self employed with fairly simple invoicing needs, and i still have to use the most expensive subscription in order to simply link expenses to invoices. the hosted services leave a lot to be desired, but they do have som me positives as well. for instance, i’m able to provide my outside tax accountant with web access to my company data 24/7 from anywhere. that’s probably a big time saver for me and many other small businesses.
everything i need. the quickbooks app has met every one of my needs for my small handyman business. i love the ability to email customers estimates, invoices, and sales receipts while i am standing there with them. i have only been using the app for a little over a month but i feel good about my decision to go with quickbooks online.
using new app for a week- more problems longer i use it. really unhappy - i am missing data and receiving error messages and my only option for assistance is to use a form. am completely disappointed in quickbooks. limited functionality! come on intuit can't do any better than this and keep up with the times- i have to use a computer or laptop to get full functionality?!
can’t bill my time from mobile. overall it’s a good app. my only complaint is that i can’t report my billable time using the apps. they have a nice integration on qb online with google calendar, it would be nice if they also add that to the mobile app. at minimum you should be able to report time to a project in the mobile app.
great app. great mobile app. only gripe is i wish they would integrate bill pay. other than that, solid app.
quick and easy. the mobile app makes business life very easy!
crashing all the time. i know it's version 1.0, but still. it's crashing left, right and center all the time. you may want to wait 6-8 months before this app is stable.
small business - excellent app. my experience so far with qb online and the apps have ben excellent so far. the website and apps have seamless integration and connects to your banking accounts easily for reconciliation. pros simple, easy to use (and working) app and web pages that allows easy customisation future development suggestions would love to be able to add/edit photos for items on device/app and not just on web-page a customisable item for unique items such as surcharges (% of sales based) would be good as well. no regrets with the subscription.
intuit is quick to take your money, but somehow doesn’t have the ability to cancel your account. i signed up for my business, never got around to using it. i finally decided to cancel the account. i had to call customer service because after an hour trying to figure it out i learned there is no way to cancel on the app. on the call customer service “doesn’t have the tools” to cancel the account either. i was sent to the website through safari to find out that there is no way to cancel or delete the account there either. thankfully the account was suspended according to the customer service representative eventually it will just disappear. great, that’s the best they can do.
very useful and convenient ever ready business tool. i was a little sceptical about migrating from paper and spreadsheet records for our small company accounts. our accountant advised the move and it has been a huge success. easy capture of expenses and bank transactions, instant views of the business via the dashboard are not powerful and easy to use. some things are a little confusing for the non-accountant, but the user interface has steadily been improving over the 18months we have been using the online system and the apps.
great app!. great app!
perfect app for consulting. fantastic app! highly recommended. very easy to use with ability to track invoices - it's perfect for my consulting business.
still doesn't work. touch id is still not working. must manually log in to the app each time i use it throughout the day. this is super annoying not to mention time consuming. and time is money!
"forced to upgrade to ios 9 - pathetic!. i personally like the ipad app better than the online version for interface, but it has so many bugs! constantly gives me error message that i'm not authorized to do something (add/edit a customer, etc.), but then it lets me do it. but i keep having to close out all the error messages that pop up. often won't let me email an invoice. won't let me add customer off of creating a new estimate (have to add customer, close, then do estimate and choose customer again). the list of basic things that should not be an issue goes on and on. on the iphone app, there is no place for my reps to view the contact person's name at the company! i'm sure there are other things i could think of, but i've just learned to compensate and work around things. however an app with this many bugs should not be out there - it's pretty pathetic! update 11/18/15 - after update, all the previous bugs are still there. pathetic to issue an update and not fix what was wrong! update 1/14/16 - even worse! now i can no longer add an item to an estimate or see the customer name on estimates or invoices under ""activity"". what is wrong with you people? if you can't make it better, leave it alone! now it is completely useless! update 11/7/16 - i absolutely hate you for forcing me to upgrade to ios 9!!! i have been suffering with quickbooks ipad's pathetic bugs for well over a year. i am forced to use it for my job because my laptop is old and i hardly ever pull it out anymore. everything i do is on my ipad. however, i have an older model (not by years, but by model) and after the mess updating to ios 8.3 created for me, i vowed i would never update again! none of the other apps on my ipad have forced me to do this. app developers are generally sensitive to the fact that not everyone chooses to disrupt their life by updating their device and spending days having to learn to use it all over again (and deal with whatever new bugs it brings to the table). you must have the absolutely lowest level of developers out there who first, couldn't fix even simple bugs in your app (like telling me every time i set up a customer or did an estimate ""i wasn't authorized to do it"" and then warning me if i got out of it all data would be lost. but it wasn't and everything i did was still in the system. even our boss got this message and she is the administrator). there were a myriad of other quirks we had to work around and now your solution is to release a new version, but in so doing force everyone to upgrade to ios 9 because your developers weren't smart enough to know how to make it work with previous ios versions??? shame on you! you would get 0 stars in my review if i could and if this new version isn't totally bug free, you will really hear from me!"
"expense management isn't there yet. the app is so close, but 2 stars because this is a major hassle. expenses that you input and assign to a customer are not marked as billable and there's no way to make them as billable. they're always input as nonbillable. for me, all of the expenses i assign to customers should be billable, so i have to manually go through them at the end of the month in the desktop version to fix this (which means i sometimes miss them). just having a ""billable"" field on the mobile that carries over to the desktop would solve all of this. alternatively, adding the billable field to the main expense view on the desktop, or a report that showed billable vs nonbillable expenses would also fix this."
prestige fleet maintenance. would love to be able to have card transactions go through quicker. takes 3-4 days then additional 1-2 days to be deposited in my account about a week waiting on money is hard for a start up business. would love next day deposits! other than that i like the system!
this app does not function properly on ios13. i cannot view any customer files. i can search for them, but the app will not let me click on a customer to edit invoices.
not detailed enough. if they're going to let you invoice from the ipad, you should be able to enter/change and see all the fields that you can from a desktop the way you have set up your invoice format. i travel often and need to invoice from the road but can't send invoices the way they need to look - can't change ship to, can't use personalized fields. very disappointed in this app.
great app. found this app so easy and user friendly for our small business 😃
top notch program. i use it everyday for business! easy to use and cut my estimating time in half. i can even send estimates from the program. definitely worth the money.
business solutions made simple. it's really great to have such an app to manage the business. the best part is linking the bank account with the quickbooks gives the brilliant touch of managing accounts easily. it's been more than 6 months since i started using. one suggestion is that if they could add the birthday remainders that would be great. recommended for start ups and pioneers.
ok, but should have more features. it seems like this app has been stagnate for a while, were are the updates ? you think that intuit would have pushed this app further along as far as functionality. just the fact i can't search for line items or notes, makes me wonder about the integrity of app, surely if it's web based like the online version, then make those features available to !!!! there will be a better app out there someday, and hopefully intuit will wake up and smell the coffee !!!
great app. makes life easy. one addition will make it perfect. add journal entry to the app.
online version is a work in progress. new to quickbooks online. easy to pick up. issues with duplicate transactions. laborious to shift in between screens frequently. not ideal for basic businesses. no ability to make an account inactive without deleting all transactions. home screen not useful. mobile app not useful for credit card transactions.
great app!. really handy to be able to use my phone to raise invoices or make them as paid when i check my internet banking on my phone too.
great on the go. i absolutely love using this app, lets take my office on the road!
great software all round. quickbooks is easy to use and manage. software and app work easily together. makes small businesses life simpler. love being able to use app to do expenses and invoicing on the go.
supper great and easy. this is a time saver app
very satisfied!. been using the mobile app for the past 3 months now, and i can say it does everything i need. very easy to issue invoices, receive the money, match, reconcile the bank. the support people are very helpful and have a lot of patience!
not very user friendly.. not very user friendly. have to open the app twice every time i use it. it says critical updates required log out and log in to refresh. every. single. time. i . open. the. app. i’ve tried deleting and reinstalling multiple times. when entering receipts it could have a search box at the top of vendor list do you don’t have to ask to search every time.
je. i would like to see journal entry feature added to the mobile app. i use this app as well as the online version for all of my clients. it would be nice to be able to perform all of the same functions no matter which i choose to use.
good app. i have used this now for two years. it works well.
pointless. useless app. can’t even see any supplier invoices etc. what is the point of having the app if you can’t work fully on the go!?
great app. i've been a qb user since the early 90's. the app keeps getting better with greater functionally. i'm confident that all functions will be available on the app in future release. i use this app all day to create estimates and bill customers. it's great.
new update 11/20. your new update is garbage. app shuts down immediately when it’s opened.
intuit keeps working it but stumbles on occasion. i've been a qbo user for over 4 years now and run my whole one-man business on it. each app version is a bit better than the last and they do fix bugs when notified. i continue to be happy to see intuit continue to improve the app and the web interface. the latest version (5.2) of the ios has a minor bug in the dashboard where bank and cc account balances were blanked out after the update but killing and restarting the app fixes it.
can’t do the most basic things. i have been a qb online user for a number of years. however using the app on my ipad, i find it extremely frustrating as it appears they put very little effort into the app versus the online desktop version. if you think about it, what are the two most basic things you need to do in quickbooks? seeing what invoices are due to you from customers and what invoices you owe vendors. both of these you cannot do in the qb online app. when i called, they asked for my account number and you cannot even find that in the app. ultimately they advised me to not use the app and to login through safari.
so cool, so simple, so effective... in the simplest of terms a really rewarding and almost uplifting piece of software that looks so cool and accomplished to your clients and prospects that even the simplest of estimates or invoices, imparts an image of uncanny levels of professionalism and efficiency. in practice it is a simple delighted to use and i could not be more pleased with this lovely piece of software. i'm sure there must be many shortcomings and shortfalls of which i'm not aware, but all i can say is it ticks all the boxes for me, after spending a quite ridiculous amount of time investigating all the viable options and alternatives available. highly recommended.
great & up-to-date!. this is a great little app to give you access into the back end of your quickbooks online account. great for doing simple invoicing and adding expenses. i still use the desktop browser for more complicated reports and such. well done and intuit keeps the app up to date thank you!
"problems. this app will not let me save an invoice, it always says ""this number already exists"" no matter which number i add. only started the error on the 30/11/12, please fix."
this app is worthless. literally none of the things i routinely do with quickbooks is possible with this app.
great app. best app ever for a mobile business.
waste of time. this isn’t even a functional version of qbo. i originally went to safari to look at something on my ipad and the site suggested downloading this useless app. i did and was very excited at first to see a clean design and quick setup. that was quickly dashed when i discovered that you apparently can’t do anything in the app. i can’t find invoices or bills, let alone enter new transactions. i search for transactions i know are there and the app doesn’t find them. worthless. i’ll be recommending to our leadership team that we finally abandon this sinking ship known as intuit once we get past year-end.
not great, but no other options on phone/ipad. this is terribly buggy software. intuit is not on the ball with development. enter a transaction or invoice on this app, then find it not entered on quickbooks online. won't sync. menus don't work or show on the ipad or iphone. called intuit and they said it's still a young app and they're working on it. i have little faith. hope this all gets fixed.
not as god as desktop or web access. i’ve been using quickbooks online for over a year and while it’s ok, it’s really lacking in a lot of areas. also, the mobile app can not perform a variety of common tasks that the computer app and web interface can do. for instance, i cannot edit certain invoices on mobile if they have expenses included. once an expense is added to an invoice, only the desktop app or web interface can edit it. also, as many have said, if you’re used to the traditional quickbooks pc or mac software which has been available for many years, the hosted version can be difficult to adjust to. it’s not capable of everything the older software can do, and a separate paid subscription is required for every company file you maintain. i am self employed with fairly simple invoicing needs, and i still have to use the most expensive subscription in order to simply link expenses to invoices. the hosted services leave a lot to be desired, but they do have som me positives as well. for instance, i’m able to provide my outside tax accountant with web access to my company data 24/7 from anywhere. that’s probably a big time saver for me and many other small businesses.
do not buy. while i think this could be a good product, the app ruins it. i have both the base and the arm. the app crashes every time i use them. at times it takes 3 tries to get them to finish reading. terrible product!
needs to fix bugs. i love quickbooks online and the desktop version but their mobile app needs to fix their bugs. i told quickbooks support two months ago that i couldn't email an invoice from the app and they couldn't help me fix the problem then. i still cannot send invoices from my mobile app so it is basically useless to me.
handy app.. i've struggled for a while with record keeping and this app makes it very easy to keep records and do my day to day book keeping.
can’t enter, view or edit bills. this app would be great, except you can’t enter or edit bills. workaround would be to login to website, but then what’s the point of having the app.. just use the website for full functionality
great small business app. i've been using it for a year and it has made my life so much easier. customers can pay progressively. i log on 20-30x a day for inputting expenses, billing customers, creating quick estimates and i have never had it not work for me. although it is very expensive combined with quickepay (quickens version of the square reader)
love the mobile app. they have made huge improvements to the mobile app. i don't have to access my desktop version as much. has greatly improved my ability to send invoices to customers in the fly. has decreased waiting for payments of invoices dramatically.
the whites. the only thing i like about the app is the ease of tracking expenses. pretty much everything else is only accessible from a desktop or laptop computer. invoices are a major problem with this app. most of our clients don't use or don't have an email address to send invoices to. so i have to individually print each one. i would like to be able to batch print invoices, as this is how most clients prefer to be billed. not being able to access customer info offline is some what of a hassle, as most of the time when it needs to be accessed we are on the phone with the customer. the online version of quickbooks seems to be quite the waste of money. just buy the desktop version.
ties well to qbo but what's the point of having touchid???. update: i like that touchid has been added, but why does it only work when i go away for a few minutes after logging in via password??? if i can get a log into banking and credit card apps with just the fingerprint then why can't i do that here? what's the point of it if it's only when i'm idle for a few minutes and come back to it??? as it is right now it's useless to have it. the app is very easy to use. you can adjust invoices easily and take payments within an invoice. it ties to quick books online very well. i wish it was easier to take payments outside of invoices, but i guess that's what the gopayment app is for. but that app doesn't automatically import the inventory items i'm tracking in qbo so there's no perfect solution.
very convenient. app is great when you are not in your office.
great app!. super convenient to track all my business transactions on the go. recent updates have made it much easier and more features are accessible.
qb app liberates and empowers me. i use both the app and the online version to much satisfaction. the app lets me easily edit an invoice and see which invoice and recurring billing have been paid. i do use recurring billing yet i set that up via the online version at my computer. i can access my books on the go, and that is what i needed from the app.
very easy to use. the app is fantastic as it is very user friendly and has everything i need. i've used myob in the past and that was terrible compared to the quickbooks app; which is in line with the times.
great little app. excellent app for basic book keeping invoicing etc and keep up with the book keeping on the fly. but to do the serious stuff you still need to work from a laptop or desktop.
not working. app will not open on iphone 6 plus
useless. just as useless as the old 'mobile site.' you can't do anything with it! quickbooks: please make an app that can do something!
very convenient!. i like the fact that i can access my invoices and payments from my phone. it's a convenient app for me!
best accounting app. easy to understand & learn
quickbooks. quickbooks has been absolutely amazing overall. main issue is customer service and their ability to provide customer support for the app. i was required to ph 3 different numbers, one being out of service. once i finally spoke to csr he was extremely friendly but did state they haven’t been provided proper training to assist with app related issues but would do his best to help. i would upgrade to 4 or 5 stars if they provide a user friendly option for support.
no consistency between apps or pc. your options and functions between desktop ipad and phone are all completely different. need to send a statement of invoices from the field no problem if you have a laptop, you’ll just have to wait until you get home if using a tablet or phone. need to get your company id for customer service to resolve an issue? no worries just make sure your not on an ipad because you cant find that information under settings like the phone and desktop version. this would have been 4 stars easily if there was any congruence between experiences. the lack of consistent performance and the hassle of trying to remember what i did and didn’t do in a day so that i can do it once i’m home eliminate the usefulness and in my opinion benefit quickbooks online is supposed to bring. would have chosen a different billing program had i known. now i have to weigh the hassle against the effort to port my billing to another platform. save your money and take your business elsewhere if you work from the field.
bad program. won't send estimates and invoices. buisness cash flow has been screwed up.
signature issues. the app crashes every time i get a signature or it doesn't save the signature. please resolve this issue
not sure yet. too early to rate this app. only second time me using it. ill check back in a couple of months with a more thought out opinion.
like it better than the pc version. easy to use, categorize expenses, and use. it's actually easier to use than the full version on a laptop browser.
ios 13. i’ve updated my iphone 8 to ios 13 and quickbooks won’t load at all. i’ve deleted and re uploaded the app and it’s the same. any updates coming soon for the app? other than that, don’t update your phone if you rely on quickbooks in your phone
lifesaver. i love this app, it saves me so much time on the road and so much paperwork later.
qbo. quick books online is a great app. the ability to have access to business data at all times is not only critical but essential for any business.
great app. what a great app and ease of access across all platforms.
easy to use. this app has been a life saver for starting a business and trying to keep the records straight. makes it easy for my accountant to access my records. good job quickbooks
mobile vs desktop. i see no reason the same features can’t be provided in the mobile app as the desktop interface.
virtually useless. for our sme this app is terrible, but has showed slow signs of improvement over the last 4 years. all i use it for is uploading director expenses. this works well, the only reason i gave 2stars rather than 2. the online version is great, but the app has most of the functionality missing. rather than re-invent the wheel i think it would be better to make the online desktop version work on smartphones and stop wasting time and money improving the app. missing functionality in the app that comes to mind is: 1) lack of foreign currency a/c support. 2) p&l report is very limited e.g. the online version allows you to click on cogs and you see a breakdown, not on the app version 3) all the reports from online version are missing from the app (apart from p&l which is poor). not even balance sheet! 4) no export to pdf/excel 5) no clear homepage that gives overview of total outstanding invoices, overdue invoices 6) no chart of accounts 7) no reconciliation 8) no purchase orders
great app to run my business. easy invoicing have app set up and operating in less then 30 min
don't count on it being 100% reliable!. have been using this program for a couple years. in the begging, it was great (for the most part). lately it's been denying my employees and self access, giving me a variety of errors. after spending over an hour with customer service, the conclusion is - their version of the software doesn't function with each and every ios update. my company sells fresh truffles to hotels, restaurants, resorts, etc... and so, we weigh the truffles on-site, create their invoice while we're in the kitchen and must collect a digital signature (through the app itself) to ensure their accounting department will take accountability and pay us in a timely manner. aside from truffles being the most expensive food on the planet, they're also the most perishable (90%+ water, which means they/i lose weight/money each hour i sit on them)! so, beyond not being able to deliver my product in a timely manner, as requested by our customers, we've been forced to sit on our product and not be able to sell until they fix the problem. all in all, we've probably lost at least $500-1000 from money literally evaporating into thin air, thanks in large to quickbooks! let alone the embarrassment of having to tell our customers we have their product but can't sell it to them. not saying the app/software is bad, just don't count on being able to rely on it like we have. caveat emptor :( update 2016: still having all sorts of issues. would not suggest unless you absolutely need it.
issues with addresses being in window of envelope. i used to be able to print off invoices and mail them to customers by folding in thirds. now i have to fold a special way to get the address to appear in the windows of the envelope.
app will crash!. app will crash! be sure to save your work!
so much better than sage. we moved from sage to this and haven’t looked back. the app is better and the links to banks work (unlike sage). the help and support is better than sage too. all in all, well worth a trial.
refund made impossible. i’ve been making payment on this stupid app not using it at all. there’s no easy way to refund or unsubscribe this stupid app. who do i bring the attention to since quickbook site says they have nothing to do with the billing and subscription?
great app!. very user-friendly and convenient. great for people who are needing to create invoices and estimates and track expenses. the iphone app is fantastic!
log in feature.. new version requires you to log in each day, while this may not sound horrible, this app was created for ease of use. previous versions required you to log in once, then your finger print or 4 digit passcode would suffice. please bring that back.
zero stars new version is junk. i used this app several times a day. i run my business on this app. since april 10th i cannot access my data. my business is suffering and intuit cannot fix it. i still have to pay. tech support at intuit / quickbooks recommended i switch to a android. (i doesn't work on my iphone or ipad) i really do not want to invest in new hardware. stay away from intuit they do not care and offer no solutions.
used to be happy.... i really used to love this app. but lately, it seems like it's always needing updating. the last couple of updates have been the worst. are used to be able to add an invoice, save it, and immediately receive a payment. now i have to go back out to the main menu to receive the payment. it's added a couple of extra steps that are unnecessary. i don't really understand the changes and even though i have expressed my opinion to quickbooks, nothing has changed. it doesn't sound like a big problem but it adds extra steps to what was once an easy process.
great app!!. accounting made easy, great interface and easy to use. highly recommended.
excellent invoice and stock update tool. this is so much more convenient than other accounting tool or software. i was able to send bills sitting in a remote destination and also input product purchase and services as and when the job was getting done. there is no time waisted by yourself as well as customers waiting for billing. excellent product.
discontinued...... of course vie been using this app for over a year now and has been super handy. lately been having issues so i called qb only to be told it's discontinued now. wonderful.
invoicing. i use quickbooks as a means to invoice customers and collect deposit for jobs. for me it's worth it. it would be great if you could get a notification that the customer has decided to pay by credit card should you need to adjust your estimate.
best accounting app. perfect for any small business. never had any problem, never crashes. only need more invoicing templates.
it's a good basic app. i like the app and i really enjoy quickbooks online. i would like for the invoices to allow my clients to pay through paypal and to be able to scan receipts instead of manually entering the data. the app is fairly limited but it's good enough for a quick overview when you need it.
oakes firewood llc. great app! love it! easy and fast to use. good job!
good accounting software. i've experimented with xero,reckon,myob and various accounting apps but this is best of the lot. it connects to your bank account transactions and as you enter your expenses it automatically matches them making bank reconciliation a breeze. once you set up your customer list it's so easy to select one and see what they owe you and also to look at costs for that customers job. the supplier list is good and you can see where your at with a particular supplier at anytime. customer service is fast and you get very detailed answers to any query. the only thing i would like to see is more customised invoicing. i like how you can add as many receipts photos and notes to each customer happy with the program so far.
qb app. excellent app is very funcional
subscription does not work. after 1 month free trial (in which i never been interested as i was happy to pay from beginning) the app stoped working. payment is demanded, unfortunately on ipad or iphone version either it is not possible to make a payment/subscription or the instructions are not clear enough or there is an error. to subscribe should be made as easy as possible.
happy with the app. i’ve used for quickbooks and the app for a year now and it has really helped my business and is a easy way to keep track of customers and quotes
very handy app. so far like this app. i need not go to my computer for bookkeeping or to see what’s going on with accounting. only i am not happy about general entries. earlier, i was able to open and see general entries. now app doesn’t open general entry. when i tried to open, it took me back to homescreen.
getting better. you can keep doing more and more on phone. great for us small business owners. it would be 5 but when i first downloaded there was not a lot to transactions you could complete on app.
the best billing and accounting on the go. i run a computer support business month go from this app. we used to have qb desktop and had issues with mobility. it was stuck on the computer. with qbo we have the mobility we need to access our accounting anywhere. we use the app everyday to lookup customers, take payments, send paid invoices, create estimates and even get them signed to begin wok in the field. in addition to that i can pull up reports like my current profit and loss to see how profitable the organization is. the only thing i miss in the app is the option to get directions from google maps instead of apple maps (i can't even copy the added on a customer card) or copy the phone number attached to a customer to paste into ringcentral (our voip app)
easy and convenient. i own a construction business, and have grown very fond of this app. it's really convenient to use the app to maintain our books on the go. my husband and i wear many hats in our business. our time is precious, but quickbooks online helps free up some of that time with its ease of use.
great. this app makes doing business efficiently even easier! i love it
convenient access to financial information. we recently switched over from the desktop version of qb and have found the app to be a convenient way to view financial statements. i also really like the ability to take pictures of receipts and attach them to expenses from my mobile phone.
good start but not able to use. in note hand. i use other intuit products and like. i need an app to feed expenses & income to turbo tax foe a small landscape business. i invoice my customer every 2 weeks for all work & materials used every day during that period. so i need : daily date entry on each line. not available ability to have multiple entry lines on same date, like labor, materials, hauling on dec 10 then again on dec 11th ability to go back & insert lines in order that items occurred. no insertions here i do not wish for hourly rate to show for labor as it varies per machine & person type. can not change invoice appearance. it takes 2 lines plus line spacing too enter each item, making a two week invoice cover 3 + pages that i now get onto 1 page i can not see how items are going to feed properly into turbo tax for business for proper tax payment.. ie labor, taxes on labor, fuel charges per machine as purchases r entered, then what about things like mulch or plants i purchase and bill the customer for??? lots of unanswered questions here. thanks
good but............... this app needs to have a debit option when adding expenses. also i am really frustrated at this moment, because your app keeps crashing on my ipad. if theses 2 issues are fixed i would give it 10 stars⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
simply works. it does the job. would like to give 5 stars but unfortunately the app still doesn't allow me to work with multiple currencies.
need an important upgrade. i love the app and all the updates but we really need to information from journal entries to show up in the expenses on the app. it shows up on a computer but the app gives us false information.
great stuff. for me, this app is perfect. as a freelance travel writer i can take a snap shot of my expenses and update my accounts on the road. the only problem i have is that you cannot access the app when you have no coverage so i cannot work offline.
best app for my business!. not a good app when it doesn't download your banking, nor did it make good invoices/estimates. i love invoicesasap, but this app needs help.
excellent accounting app. invoicing to my customers has become very quick and payments entry are the coolest which i found. secondly the one year 70% discount is the main which attracted me. i hope this discount continues i also go ahead with this accounting software app. the negative is that i am not able to connect to my local bank in uae for reconciliation.that's all from me. thanks for giving me opportunity to write a review.
quickbooks online app needs lots of work still. the basic problem is it’s way too slow no matter where i am. usually end up just going through the internet. they are always changing things !😡
vast improvement over qb software. i can't even begin to describe how much more user friendly qbo is. i'm not just talking about the app, but about the entire online system. i used qb 2008, 2011 and 2013. it did what i needed it to do - but it wasn't very pleasant or user friendly. on several occasions - usually around upgrade cycles - i had issues converting data to new formats. with qbo, viewing the data is a lot easier, and feels more...airy and open. that sounds cheesy, but when you're looking at numbers a lot, it gets monotonous. i can do just about everything i did on the old software, with the added bonuses of doing the work directly from my phone if need be. the most important features - sending invoices, viewing customer info, and checking profit loss statements, is all there within easy reach. a few suggestions for improvement: 1. it would be great if we could process a credit card payment directly from our phones, for clients that already have signed an agreement, and we have their cc info on file. currently, you have to add the cc info again, manually, on the phone each time if you are processing from phone. this is especially useful with recurring invoices that need to be processed while i'm on the road, and i can't get to my laptop. 2. delayed charges that get converted into invoices cannot have payments received against them on mobile app. not sure why, i get a message saying that i have to process delayed charges from website. 3. when i brought my customer data into qb online, i could not bring in my recurring transactions (formerly memorized transactions) - they had to be rebuilt from scratch. it took me nearly three months to get them all in the system, on and off when i was able to work on it. totally worth it, but in hindsight i wish there was an easy import tool, which cross referenced the customers associated with the recurring transactions. overall, i am still confident that making the switch to quickbooks online was the right choice. thank you and keep up the good work.
great small business app. just opened up my first company,being a one person office ,secretary, and boss this app is great to help micro manage all your small office responsibilities. it's a great app to email quick quotes onsite for that customer who looking for the job to get done asap. have to say this made my work day is alot easier and definitely is less complicated!!!!
not bad. this is a huge improvement over the standard quickbooks mobile apps. unfortunately, the deal breaker for me is that it still does not seem to include a way to capture a signature on invoices. many of my clients require a signature on each invoice that i forward to them, so i must continute to use my existing solution. i have hopes that this will be addresed in the future, as it otherwise seems to be an excellent product.
brilliant. excellent accounting software for new small business. only issue i have is that i bought a subscription online and the app keeps telling me to subscribe
slow to respond from time to time .. the app is sometimes slow to respond.
great app. easy easy for an accounting knucklehead like me. just give my acct the password for taxes and keep going. love it
great app. love that i can get estimates approved right on my phone!
highly recommend. i highly recommend this app. i run my business with quickbooks online and use this app daily. i use it to create estimates and invoices mostly but also look up look up costumers balances and run reports.
excellent business investment. i can't say enough about this app. it was the best investment i have made when switching from quicken to quickbooks. i was spending 20+ hours a week working on invoicing and now i can send them right away from my phone or send them in a batch in less than 5 mins. the app does have a few things i would suggest needs to be added like able to update recurring transactions and deleting multiple invoices at one time. otherwise it is excellent and i use it everyday and enjoy it.
great but.... very great app. i rated three stars because you can’t enter employee time from your mobile device. i know it’s a mobile app but you should be able to enter time . i understand that mobile apps are a little different but this seems like a simple task that should be possible. i send invoices and estimates all the time with the mobile app other than that it’s a great app. will update rating when these features are added
great app. i've been a qb user since the early 90's. the app keeps getting better with greater functionally. i'm confident that all functions will be available on the app in future release. i use this app all day to create estimates and bill customers. it's great.
no too bad. this app for the self employed version is pretty good. using the ipad is less so, mainly because it will not rotate into landscape view and the appearance of the interface is slightly blurry / not sharp like other apple apps. the features though, on the whole are pretty good.
perfect for a small consulting firm. this app is everything i need for my consulting firm. easy to use and easy to keep track of expenses on the road. invoicing is a breeze. love the data in the cloud. take a pic and throw away those receipts! works flawlessly between my mac, ipad and iphone. no complaints whatsoever.
access to qb contacts please. love this app, means i can work while out with the kids. would be better if my phone was allowed access to my quickbooks contacts as my husband adds the contacts and they call before i have chance to add them to my phone.
subscribe through intuit first. i purchased quickbooks online through the app store. the app works fine, but i cannot upgrade my account because i'm now captive by apple rather than having flexibility through intuit. contacted intuit who informed me there is nothing they can do with my account because i signed up outside their site.
a long way to go and terrible support. i use the app as my chosen qb solution, i had added customer logos and always attached my receipts. i have been having problems to edit my phone number within the app and was advised to uninstall/ reinstall by qb support. in doing so i have lost all my attachments from the app, they are online but do not sync back to the app. highly frustrating as i’ve lost one of the key visual features particularly on my expenses. the support from the original issue has been going on months and now this one a couple weeks but they never offer a real working solution.
awesome. i have an hvac business and everything in this app is awesome. the invoicing,estimates,collecting payments, emailing invoices or estimates, the whole thing. my wife does the books and she loves this version of quickbooks better than the pro version. i can access it from my ipad or iphone and my wife can access it from her samsung phone. all around great app. you do have to have the quickbooks online version on a computer and it has a monthly fee, but well worth it.
many issues.... most of the time they come up with an update it does not work well after we update the app. they should test this updates before releasing it.
"great app. excellent app that integrates with lots of other apps i use. it has saved me many hours doing my accounts. (game changer for sure!) - i just wish i could change the wording ""shipping address"" to ""property address"" but maybe in time"
poor experience. the app is extremely buggy, unstable, and very slow. logging into the app is unpredictable and i'm randomly logged out. entering receipts is quite painful to say the least, and is impossible without a decent internet connection.
interstate_g. i’m a young entrepreneur. no degrees and some college classes in my background. when i say that this app is easy and straightforward forward, helps me run my business, and does most of the work. easy is an understatement. if accounting is your barrier in your buisness look no harder cause qb is the answer.
love but.... great! except would love to be able to make a deposit with the app
perfect for small businesses. i run our homeowners association with a budget of less than 100k. quickbooks is the perfect app for managing the everyday finances for our small business. it literally takes less than 15 minutes every quarter to send out 24 invoices to homeowners. the previous board spent hours sending out invoices. the account also links perfectly with our bank account so reconciling all income and expenses is simple and quick. reporting meets our basic needs and allows me to share information with our board members automatically every month. the ui is very intuitive and pleasing as well. overall, the cost/benefit of the app is perfect for our needs.
some critical shortfalls. there are many great parts to quickbooks online and the app, however some of the shortfalls are not worth it. - cannot invoice a % of an invoice, it's all or nothing - usd clients do not show up on the app - if an estimate is changed, there is no record of the change and the older versions are gone - does not allow for a templated terms and conditions on invoices or estimates, you have to copy paste into the memo section, which has very limited space
great app!. 2 thumbs up!
"there photo above shows signature capture, it does not have it. no signature capture debacle update: #2 of 8-7-17 well look at that the capture signature button is there now. now either the button was not there and added now or the button was there and customer service has no clue what there doing and how to use there own product. see notes below) im giving ***** right here but not changing my app store stars im sorry , the customer service was ridiculous and a waste of my time. horrible. wow so frustrating thank you for responding to my review here i appreciate it. please for love of bookkeeping train those people geez. update: 8-7-17 in your response to your most recent update. all the customer service calls noted below were for the mobile app. and your help center that i guided customer service to view is geared towards the mobile app. and those are the responses i received from them over the phone. update : response to developer 8-5-17 puzzled ? as am i 🙄 i called in 4 times about this ability to capture signatures first time i called the customer service person tells me, no we dont have that no you cant. then i asked why is it your help center data base clearly stating plain as day instructions on how to. 1. create new invoice 2. enter all needed information 3. click on the capture signature. also not to mention the fact the screen shot here in apple app store for quickbooks clearly shows a signature being captured. so after lots of back and forth tells me this is a new and quickbooks company doesn't tell them (customer service) what quickbooks os doing. what!? got off the phone didn't want to waste anymore of my time. round 2 call customer service tells me that its not capable of capture signatures, then after guided her to your help center where it clearly states how to puts me on hold then comes back and says that its new and there and there implementing it in in phases !? and my account number is part of phase 3 and would add the capture signature button in 3 weeks. ugh ok i guess i can understand that. round 3 called in again she also tells me no its not possible explained my last call with customer service and stated i was checking on the the update phase. after explaining the last call i had to this customer service rep. she was more bewildered than prob you are right now reading and she to was left puzzled as was i. then proceeded to put me on hold to research. comes back tells me yes you can but only if you have a merchant services account through you. hmm thats odd i thought. she tells me that the signature capture is for payment credit card. so i proceeded to explaining a plain signature capture by a customer on an invoice. she proceeded to tell me no unless you have a merchant account. ok fine over, but before i got off i guided her to the help area in quickbooks if you search how to capture signature. it clearly says so and what she told me didn't match with what was posted on the help area. which is capture signature---available on invoices and estimates. now if your estimate is being signed i didn't know you had to have a merchant account and i didn't know thats industries standard to run a credit card transaction off of an estimate. in the end puzzled as you are and pretty much moving on to another service unless you can find someone that knows what exactly is going on over there at quickbooks. that i will end up speaking too someone that knows what there doing and what there talking about, i will not call and waste more of my time . and by the way your web browser version of quickbooks online on a mobile device does not load correctly the right side is cut off making the invoices or anything you do on there useless im on an ipad 12"" pro. doesn't matter what browser you use same prob, try using the app instead but cant as it lacks all the features the browser version does. so any way you cut it. no signature capture something so simple to do. please let me know what you think of all that, im trying to be helpful here as i expect better from quickbooks your industry see your help instructions below capture signatures using quickbooks online for mobile open a new or existing estimate or invoice. add any transaction info, as usual. select get signature. let your customer sign with their finger. they can always clear it and sign again. select done (android) or save (iphone/ipad). you'll see the signature on the estimate or invoice. it's that easy! update: 7-27-17 there is no signature capture on invoices even though they tell you there is there is not. it only applies through tak ing payment by credit card transaction through quickbooks. something that is so basic to business the leading book keeping company can not provide. walk into customers store drop product they sign the invoice received! thats it! nope not quickbooks so pass them up. plus thats not counting time hours and hours of lousy customer service and back and forth till they finally fessed up to it. don't waste your time."
pretty good app. this has turned out to be a pretty useful app. very nice to be able to add receipts as i make purchases. very nice to create estimates! i would give it five stars if they would add reports for each customer. the current reports is lame. also very lame i can't add and pay bills!!! come on qb's! it's a business app. we pay bills!!!!!
sweet business app. fantastic app for running my business when in remote areas or on the go!! no glitches with the app either!
won't connect to qb online since update.. i've been using qb for ipad with few issues to date, until the latest update. now, i'm on a job, trying to invoice a customer and can not since the app will not connect to qb online.
"work well.. this app works as promised. i would like to see a few changes. 1. taxes should be calculated via location. as it is now you have to specify tax zone and amount. 2. the credit card collection portion takes a very long time and does not integrate as well as expected into the software. i would hope that processing could be reduced from 5-7 days to 1-2 and the transaction charge could come in with a split showing the cost. while i am here...on the transaction label it comes in the same as the monthly bill so you have to be careful to note what account you post the expense to and the auto match feature does not work on there own product. 3. very small but important. the ipad, phone, and computer have quite different navigational feels so it is a learning curve for all three not feeling as natural as expected but very user friendly. 4. okay on more small desire. i would like a ""remember me"" feature for my phone so i don't have to type my password in every few days. my phone is highly secure and all the protection i feel i need when accessing via that interface."
great app. quickbooks online works really well, fits my needs as an independent consultant. the mobile app is great for keeping me current on the fly.
lacks some functionality. my biggest problem is the app does a poor job of reconciling obviously matching expenses.
almost useless. the app is good for sending invoices only. don't expect to be able to do any other business on the app. the mobile site is about as good as healthcare.gov. you can look at some things but forget everything else. again good for sending invoices only. i expected more from a established company.
reduced feature set. need to have timesheet function put into app!
i love it. i use this app and software everyday to organize and manage cash flow in my business. i don't know what i would do without it!
best business app. very quick, no bugs or errors. love it!!!
love it!. best app for my business!
greta app. great app. does the job and provides me accessibility through my ipad or iphone. very easy to understand and easy to set up invoicing with your logo. allows you to easily print different reports, calculate gross profit and profit margin per invoice. very solid app.
improve your customer service. the program it’s self is easy to use, but if you need to call the customer service you have to request it by logging on and email/text or the other problem is they don’t speak english well. with increasing prices they should have great customer service just saying!
great for mobile. i have enjoyed using the app. has what i need for most part.
keep crashing. after last update june 12 2019 keep crashing. new update came just an hour ago still same crash???!!!doesn’t launch the app. please fix asap pleasseeee
requires : raise po to supplier function. missing few essential functions the app: ability to raise purchase orders to suppliers in the app: with ability to turn this feature on or off in app. link / allocate supplier orders (purchases) to sales back orders. flow chart from sales po - purchasing of stock against sales inv or sales po - and linking of purchased shipments’ tracking info. it would be good to be able to pull up the relationships between items clients orders of both sales and purchase and actual shipping info via tracking number and api to view the flow of supply against sales orders etc. sap has this ability (minus some of the features mentioned) allocating ordered stock (purchased) against sales orders to have a clear indication on how much of the ordered stock is pre-allocates and how much is extra stock for shelf. link with shipping programs by entering dimensions and weight and to book from with in or through api. that would make the program ace!
taking our business to a new level. we have been so happy since we switched to quickbooks online plus! it has allowed us to streamline our invoicing and bookkeeping. our clients love how easy it is to pay invoices online. we love knowing we've received payment for each cleaning performed! qb customer service is excellent.
good app, a bit expensive to upgrade. good app, but a bit expensive to upgrade. it holds me back from doing it
quickbooks online receive payment is terrible. if you can afford to have your customers pay online then have quickbooks charge you for each payment received then taking those payments on putting hold on them like in them up for three months before releasing the funds then get the software your small business and can’t take the risk of having your customers payment held up at any point for any reason you don’t want this software. i had quickbooks online and option to receive payments online. two of my customer made seven consecutive online payments for over $19,000 without notice explanation or a valid reason. quickbooks put a hold on the deposits into my account. these same custom previously paid online with no problems the account showed customer payment received but not deposited. quickbooks never notified me or explained to me why they didn't deposit for funds or what their policy was regarding holding customer online payments without depositing into bank accounts.payments. after making several calls to quickbooks they finally told me that the funds were put on hold because of possible fraud and requested i send them in with the mask of documentation regarding the service and items performed and sold, were the items came from purchase price customer payment receipts hello cremation that i didn’t feel need to be disclosed. even though the customers payments had cleared their account quickbooks held the funds for over 90 days, collected the interest and gave me the runaround with a list of things to do in order to have them to release the payments and deposit them into my account. quickbooks only release the funds after i threatened to go public and blast them on social media. i would not recommend you choose to receive payments online through quickbooks. first there fees for receiving payments online are excessive, then they are subject to keep your customers payments and not deposit into your account, without notice or explanation or valid reason for any amount of time. very disappointed in quickbooks for doing this and the customer service responses i received when trying to get an answer why it was done.
love it. this app works great for me.. .
excelente app. intuit ha hecho un excelente trabajo de poner a la mano literalmente los libros de contabilidad de la práctica y de los clientes. totalmente funcional y fácil de usar.
great app!!. no issues so far. simple to use.
"there photo above shows signature capture, it does not have it. no signature capture debacle update: #2 of 8-7-17 well look at that the capture signature button is there now. now either the button was not there and added now or the button was there and customer service has no clue what there doing and how to use there own product. see notes below) im giving ***** right here but not changing my app store stars im sorry , the customer service was ridiculous and a waste of my time. horrible. wow so frustrating thank you for responding to my review here i appreciate it. please for love of bookkeeping train those people geez. update: 8-7-17 in your response to your most recent update. all the customer service calls noted below were for the mobile app. and your help center that i guided customer service to view is geared towards the mobile app. and those are the responses i received from them over the phone. update : response to developer 8-5-17 puzzled ? as am i 🙄 i called in 4 times about this ability to capture signatures first time i called the customer service person tells me, no we dont have that no you cant. then i asked why is it your help center data base clearly stating plain as day instructions on how to. 1. create new invoice 2. enter all needed information 3. click on the capture signature. also not to mention the fact the screen shot here in apple app store for quickbooks clearly shows a signature being captured. so after lots of back and forth tells me this is a new and quickbooks company doesn't tell them (customer service) what quickbooks os doing. what!? got off the phone didn't want to waste anymore of my time. round 2 call customer service tells me that its not capable of capture signatures, then after guided her to your help center where it clearly states how to puts me on hold then comes back and says that its new and there and there implementing it in in phases !? and my account number is part of phase 3 and would add the capture signature button in 3 weeks. ugh ok i guess i can understand that. round 3 called in again she also tells me no its not possible explained my last call with customer service and stated i was checking on the the update phase. after explaining the last call i had to this customer service rep. she was more bewildered than prob you are right now reading and she to was left puzzled as was i. then proceeded to put me on hold to research. comes back tells me yes you can but only if you have a merchant services account through you. hmm thats odd i thought. she tells me that the signature capture is for payment credit card. so i proceeded to explaining a plain signature capture by a customer on an invoice. she proceeded to tell me no unless you have a merchant account. ok fine over, but before i got off i guided her to the help area in quickbooks if you search how to capture signature. it clearly says so and what she told me didn't match with what was posted on the help area. which is capture signature---available on invoices and estimates. now if your estimate is being signed i didn't know you had to have a merchant account and i didn't know thats industries standard to run a credit card transaction off of an estimate. in the end puzzled as you are and pretty much moving on to another service unless you can find someone that knows what exactly is going on over there at quickbooks. that i will end up speaking too someone that knows what there doing and what there talking about, i will not call and waste more of my time . and by the way your web browser version of quickbooks online on a mobile device does not load correctly the right side is cut off making the invoices or anything you do on there useless im on an ipad 12"" pro. doesn't matter what browser you use same prob, try using the app instead but cant as it lacks all the features the browser version does. so any way you cut it. no signature capture something so simple to do. please let me know what you think of all that, im trying to be helpful here as i expect better from quickbooks your industry see your help instructions below capture signatures using quickbooks online for mobile open a new or existing estimate or invoice. add any transaction info, as usual. select get signature. let your customer sign with their finger. they can always clear it and sign again. select done (android) or save (iphone/ipad). you'll see the signature on the estimate or invoice. it's that easy! update: 7-27-17 there is no signature capture on invoices even though they tell you there is there is not. it only applies through tak ing payment by credit card transaction through quickbooks. something that is so basic to business the leading book keeping company can not provide. walk into customers store drop product they sign the invoice received! thats it! nope not quickbooks so pass them up. plus thats not counting time hours and hours of lousy customer service and back and forth till they finally fessed up to it. don't waste your time."
great for small business. i am a partner in a small mobile based business and the financial dealings are my responsibility. quick books online along with the app make everything so much easier than what we were previously using. using the app is pretty intuitive and you can accomplish anything i need to at a job site.
awesome product. general contractor have tried a lot of different apps and have spent a few hundred bucks...this one by far is the best for invoicing and providing estimates. very streamlined and quick to learn..
need app to send estimates from mobile devices. looking for way to send estimates from phone when away from office. i have been testing this qbo out for a week, this in no way replaces desktop version. currently not willing to quit the desktop version. there are a few apps out there for free that create estimates/ invoices, but don't sync with quickbooks. i had high hopes that this would be the answer, even willing to pay $20 for the app. but when i found out that i must choose between desktop and qbo, and that i have to pay a minimum of $15/ month........ i just don't do enough outside business to justify $180/ year quick books needs an app for estimates that syncs with desktop. been using desktop for about 3 years now.
loyal to qb, but... must add calendar and time sheets. i couldn't run my service business without qb online. it's so helpful for bookkeeping, creating customer profiles, creating and sending professional estimates, invoices and sales receipts. here's what i need: calendar integration and employee time sheets. as a solo owner/operator i had less to manage. now with multiple employees in the field and multiple appointments to set everyday, the iphone and ipad app really need a function within the customer profile to schedule appointments. the double data entry from qb to calendar is so time-consuming and needless with today's technology. and i really need a simple add-on for time sheets. tap your employee, enter start time, enter end time, enter labor code. sync it with qb payroll and done. dear intuit, please please please add these functions.
slow books. can’t accept transactions in banking section. sluggish app, end up using the computer more often.
do not upgrade to latest software!!. i have used this app for almost a year and it has worked very well for my small business- until today. after automatically updating itself on the app store, i can no longer save invoices and send it to my clients. i've tried restarting the app and my phone, but the problem continues. i went on the app store reviews to see if others had had the same problem, and bingo! many other users are complaining of the same issue. i hope quickbooks can figure out this problem asap before it really starts affecting my business accounting. likes: -stores repeat client info - allows for cc payment - allows me to include my company logo and information on each invoice. - alerts me of tardy invoices - provides me with easy to read charts and measure each months income/expenses dislikes: - credit card payments incurs a hefty fee rather than a monthly charge - all of my invoices have an intuit logo - customer service is hurting. wish they had a 1800 # or immediate online chat support like so many other software companies.
president. i’m busy right now trying to invoice, from customer service to user friendly software qb is on point for the business man. love the service for sure.
really useful. great app allowing me to raise invoices whilst on site, confirm details with clients and syncs with the software back at the office.
qb app fail. app is very frustrating. sometimes works great but most of time wants to download company data and 15 min later still not downloaded. i try over and over and give up. then every once in awhile it works. fix or get rid of.
instant customer service 👌. great app for small to mid size business. phenomenal integration from windows 10. so far so good. thanks.
amazing app. i got this because of danny devito
more like slowbooks. i have liked qb for years but this is my first week using the app. finding it very glitchy when doing invoices on the run. it often comes up with an error code whilst raising an invoice. you then exit the app, re-enter and check whether invoice raised - none to be seen. then try and raise invoice (sometimes multiple times because the error code keeps reappearing) and next day like magic 2 - 3 of the same invoice are there! it’s probably the most important function for the app so perhaps something to be rectified qb!
great app!. works great with my quickbooks online, fast and easy for taking credit card payments. everything syncs back to my online account and is very easy and efficient, huge time saver!
awful app - doesn’t fully sync with online data. i keep getting notifications about a 6 month overdue invoice, which i used for testing. however, when you try and remove the invoice, it can’t find it. the online version is fine if a little overpriced for sole-trader business, but this app, which costs nothing, is worth exactly that. it’s next to useless.
does most. app does most of things i need for my business. one thing i am requesting for is the ability to pay with a daily rate not just hourly. i have a home care agency and this is how we pay our employees in some cases. lynn
excellent. great app and program.
ipad perfect until ios 8.5. app hasn't worked since 8.5 update. have sent several request about the app crashing and no one has gotten back to me. i've deleted and redone loaded, rebooted ipad, etc. when not crashing it's a 5 star app. please fix asap!
fantastic features. all the features that works under this single app. i used to work with excel spreadsheet, invoice app, expense app to complete the business on the go. now everything has being simplify into this one subscription saving me time and double entry. i am absolutely happy that i can email invoice, take pictures and enter expense using my iphone. best of all these is update into the cloud. great excellent accounting software nothing comes close after trying others accounting software.
worst user experience. app is made of complex processes..i they are more focused on collecting data than providing service..uninstalled within 3 minutes
bad update. was close to perfect, or at least practical. since the last update, this app is useless to me. hoping this will change!
does not work like before. since the recent update the mobile app is useless for me. if i receive a payment and post it the app will not reflect a payment posted, desktop version shows the payment received. so if i try to post the payment then i get an unapplied payment. in other words i'm entering it twice. another thing, it does not allow me to see at glance if an invoice was sent (sent) now i have to go in to each invoice and see if there is a check mark, even if i've emailed the invoice and i still don't get a check mark, this is very confusing and the app is certainly not as functional as before. please fix.
the website & app can not connect. i input the expenses transaction in my computer website (put all the details) and when i opened the apps on my iphone, all my transactions called (no category) what should i do? alrdy delete & re-installed tho.
works well but maybe more than i really need. i have a ltd company on top of an employed job, so the company is just me and its small and i don't really need it to grow. my accountant recommended that i get quick books. it works well, does a good job of keeping track of income and expenditure and the invoicing of customers is very easy. compared to my old system in which i kept track of accounts using ms excel and then made a pdf invoice and emailed it to the customer, quickbooks is excellent, very quick and efficient. i do wish though that i could turn off some features. for instance, there are different types of income and expense, and it suggests that i have different kinds of banking / company credit cards, different business accounts. some of this is just confusing to me as it is labelled in technical jargon that i don't really understand, i wish i could just turn it off to being income, billable expenses and non billable expenses. the other problem i have is with the invoice numbers. if you forget to specify an invoice number it just defaults to the last one you made. that is maddening. i'd rather it just prompted me to fill the invoice number in. you can customise invoices from a template and that works well, customers tell me that they look clean, crisp and professional and they are easy to pay. expenses work well, you can create an expense item within an invoice and even attach a receipt or a phot o f a receipt to it, and then decide whether to include those attachments in the invoice sent to the customer. finally, it talks to my business bank account and so it tallies items in quickbooks with transactions in the bank, ensuring that both match and querying with you if they don't. in all i think its a really simple to use, great product that makes my small business finances a lot smoother than before, but i wish i could customise and simplify it a bit more.
"barely acceptable. tldr; tracking work and getting paid are either impossible or broken via the app, but are functional in the online app, mostly. there are major features lacking in the app: you cannot add delayed charges from the app, invoices generated on the web are present but not *visible* in the app! your customer asks you ""what do i owe you"" and you pull up your fancy app to show him only to get an error that the invoice was created on the web so you then waste time to dig it out of your email, all the while feeling like a fool for agreeing to a perpetual subscription for incomplete functionality. this is your life with quickbooks online. accepting payments via app is a chore: to simply select your customer (which you must do for each payment) entails several annoying steps: 1. load payment screen (two taps) 2. tap ""select customer"" (no in-line search!) 3. tap search *button* to reveal search bar 4. tap search *bar* to bring up keyboard 5. tap the customer how could this critical workflow be so poorly executed? receiving payment is the actual purpose of qb right? since most businesses have more than a screen-full of customers it might be a sane default to just start a customer search as soon as a payment is selected, saving 5 taps. at least focus the keyboard to start searching when you tap the search icon, saving 3 taps. speaking of getting paid, though not directly related to the app: quickbooks payments is a broken product, you send an invoice with a balance forward and your customer has no option to pay balance forward, so you're stuck explaining to customers that the bill they just paid is not the *entire* bill, awesome."
now works with ios13. just updated ios 13 app appears to be working on ios13.
great app. i personally find the app easier then the desktop version. everything is quick and easy to do. raise an invoice or estimate instantly and see your bank account balance. great.
great invoicing app. works great for invoicing needs.
loving it. been hunting for a simple app for managing the finances of my farm business. this helps me with capturing and analysis of all my expenses and income. the reporting is also amazing. i also love the fact that i can even get more stats and reports via the web. amazing stuff. already introduced it to quite a number of industry colleagues. truly an amazing app
won't let us start a new tax rate. the best app will not allow us to start collecting taxes. every time we initiate the tax rate and try to save it it simply says it cant perform that function please go to settings and let us know. it's ridiculous that a book keeping app as large as qb's is that such remedial tasks are often frustrating.
great app!. i have used quickbooks for years and love their software. this application takes their wonderful software to a whole new level. the mobility and ease of use are excellent! the app is well built and very easy to use. it integrates well with your main quickbooks program and syncs all your data in real time. a+++
good start. qbo app is a good start, great for on the go invoicing, estimates and receipts. paperless ... i use to have customers sign a paper copy invoice on delivery of products, now i can have them sign on my ipad or phone. negative reviews saying it is too basic and simple. i don't believe any app is made to be full functioning of its base online application.
i love this app. i love been able to do my work on the go, and quick book helps me do that
excellent app and service.. great product.
don't believe the hype. this app is practically worthless. all important actions require you to be on the website. i need to be able to invoice, payroll, and do taxes from the app as i am hardly with my computer.
terrible. what’s the point of this app, can’t even search employees. rubbish
"finally happy with intuit. every december i have thought about how much i wish i could switch to a different accounting software so this year i decided to try fresh books because i despised any intuit product that might require me to talk to their ""help center"" for a fee of course. and while fresh books was really nice software it was lacking some of the features that i was use to having with my qb desktop pro. so i tried out the qb online and had some issues with migration at first but the new stateside call center was extremely helpful and pleasant. now i'm using the phone app daily and bravo! intuit is finally making me happy to be a client of theirs."
instant customer service 👌. great app for small to mid size business. phenomenal integration from windows 10. so far so good. thanks.
disappointed. do not download this app. i'm sorry i did. extremely flawed.
great invoicing app. works great for invoicing needs.
totally awesome solution. great and easy to use. even the mobile app is awesome.
touch id does not work. i have it checked and yet when i load the app it keeps asking for password. pointless, just remove touch id as an option since it does not work as it should.
customer service is great.. had a little trouble setting up called customer service and they got me up and running.
brilliant app with loads of features!. so easy to use. so easy to learn. instant bank feeds. invite your accountant & bookkeeper & other users. so much support from intuit & the australian team. what's not to like? intuit have put together a great product for the small to medium business owner. thoroughly recommend this product.
needs to be full featured. i love the program but hate that i can’t do into my vendor bills on the app for ipad. i can’t enter them in or view them on ipad. i can on browser view but even it needs to update as everything gets cit off in chrome and when you click the menu button to hide it it does not slide everything over so you can see more.
great app!. i'm in love with this app, too bad that the proadvisor app doesn't work as sharp (doesn't work at all).
great job. great app! great for my graphic design business!
epic receipt capture fail. this app is terrible. it is slow, has bugs, and it takes way too many steps to capture receipts and add them to a transaction - which should be the main selling point for this app. in fact, you can’t even add receipts to transactions that are “for review.” you have to add the transaction before attaching a receipt. not at all useful when you want to attach a receipt do your cpa/bookkeeper can later weigh in on which account the transaction should go against. my workaround is to add the transaction via computer, then go back in via iphone to capture the receipt, but i get an error message if i do this right away...have to restart the app to get it to work! given the choice between this app and a seasick crocodile, i’d take the seasick crocodile.
don’t use the pay options.. app is great but don’t use the pay option. it took a week for the money to hit my account.
good app. 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
very good app.. really like this app.
great app. great app for small businesses
awesome!. great app, easy to use.
crashing. app keeps crashing every time i click on it!
intuit is too big to care about quality.. hi intuit, you are a multi million dollar company. why is it that importing a contact from my ipad customer list into an invoice cannot pull the address with it? this is just one of many clunky problems that companies with much less resource would identify and solve. you think you are so large and we need you so much that putting out an app like this will go up noticed. i have been using qb online since it began. your first ipad app was laughable and this one just makes me angry i have held onto my subscrition for so long. now that there are competitors it's going to take more than lowering your rate to $19/mo to keep this customer. it's insulting.
quickbooks mobile app. awesome app that let's me quickly and easily access and review what is happening at my business especially when i am away!
i love this better than their computer program!!!!. i love this app better than my computer program they have, it's easier to use & easier to track your expenses & sales. i recommend this to all my friends that basically run their business out of a vehicle saves on extra work when you get home.
works great!. for an app this is very powerful and lets you know the basics on the run.
good app. good interface. most frequently used functions included.
awesome app. love it
annoying as can be. for invoicing it will randomly not let you save what you just did. you can type a 1000 word description and it will make you refresh it. it gives you no choice. then you have to type it all over again. it’s does what it wants not what you need it to do.
quickbooks mobile app. i love the flexibility this app offers. it's a huge step and my personal goal to become paperless while giving me the ability to bill on site.
functional and practical. love the cloud software, love the app.
unresponsive. app not working not letting me update data for 5 days now. emailed company still not sorted still not happy
can't save my invoices!. my app auto updated. now i can't save my invoices on the go. i use this app all day, 6 days a week. i'm in the home services industry and i can no longer invoice my clients, which means i can't collect payment either! get this fixed!
not trustworthy. quickbooks has some issues with taking multiple accounts under the same email. i can not access my account because my email was used to open a second trial and i can not access my data any longer. choose better accounting software, overall. this app has no visible way to logout or troubleshoot.
great app, easy enough to use!. app is easy enough to use, even as a noob.
can't even login. useless program - i can only use web browser to access, app is not working at all
game changer. this has been a fantastic app. having the ability to access our estimating and billing from any devise has been great !
"keep getting ""session expired"" message with every log in attempt. completely makes the app non-functional for on the go business. critical flaw! please fix it!!"
some good features but limited and pricey.. search features are extremely limited. find an invoice using customer po number? can't. essentially, to find something you have to already know where it is. data differs from desktop version sometimes. only 2 generic reports available in mobile app. disappointing functionality considering the qb online monthly fees!
bad update. used to work good until last update now when i open the app is says downloading company data, gets stuck there for ages. if it finally loads, there are no customer invoices, just payments. tried deleting the app and reinstalling but does the same thing. the pc app works fine and my employees have samsung phones and they haven't complained of any issues may just be an iphone app problem.
useless app. intuit has an app called selfemployed which is $4.99/mo and has more functionality than this one. it’s mind boggling. i can’t use that one because i need a chart of accounts so i got this one thinking. ’same company so this app will have that functionality and more because its 10x more expensive.’ wrong. here’s what i wish someone has told me: you can’t even manage an amex account on this app. as all my expenses go on my amex business card, this app is literally useless. it shows you the balance. that’s it. you have to do manage the expenses on a desktop computer. you can manage your amex expenses in self employed. makes no sense. you like the email receipt match-up functionality in self employed? pretty nifty, right? well you can’t do it in this app either. this company is the absolute worst. it has — for two years in a row — told customers the online banking feature was going to be shut off on the desktop version forcing you to pay for upgrades. the $200 upgrade lasted a year before they told you that version was also going to have the online banking functionality turned off. intuit is a greedy company that makes buggy, mediocre software. they rely on the fact that they have the corner on the market. as soon as i can i’m jumping ship. i have a feeling i’m not the only one who feels this way, either.
please fix. please fix the issues with signing in. i am often told it is unavailable, try again later. also, it's not multi-user friendly!! love to have this app work for a simple business. please fix bugs!!
good features and functionality. lots of functionality right from your phone. i like the fingerprint sign-in when resuming the app. would be good to see a save as pdf feature on invoices and quotes. i'd like to be able to upload them to the cloud from my phone or attachment them to an existing email i am writing rather than having to email separately.
money grabber. quickbooks will offer subscription service. i paid for it because of the discount and then they didnt allow me to accept payments through their app. you have to assess the profile first before asking for payment.
love syncing real time data in the cloud. in february of 2014 i implemented qbo for a client. i loved it so much and could see immediately the benefits of working in the cloud with my clients. the greatest benefit is that all key stakeholders (bookkeeper, year-end accountant and client) are able to work in real time. we can see immediately how profitable yesterday was or even this morning! the payroll module is great. each client is responsible for some part of their bookkeeping story. for many i have them tabulate and run their own payroll. it really is so simple with this app and saves them tying up my schedule with this repetitive task. i’m just a click away if they have made a mistake or just want me to “check in to see if they did their assigned task ok”. since 2014 i have converted my entire clientele to quickbooks online! every single one. i believe in the product so much that my entire practice is 100% quickbooks online. my practice is able to operate more efficiently by taking the cloud leap and we are able to connect with our clients better. the bookkeeping family relationship has intensified. thank you intuit! you have made my life simpler. i can’t wait to see what you amaze me with next! jennie moore moore details bookkeeping
nice, but not as good as it could be. 8/19/16 update still not able to post deposits and merchandise returns from the app. i would think those would be easy tasks to add. the last update seems to have slowed the app down quite a lot. it also took away the ability to sign into the app using touch id. that was very useful. if you have the app open in the background then you can reopen it with a touch. but, to open the app you now have to type in your password. i'm not one who leaves apps running in the background all day. posted long ago: great for staying on top of purchases. but, it's too cumbersome to move around within the app efficiently. needs to have the ability to post deposits and merchandise returns/credits from within the app.
brilliant!. easy to use, matches payments received and ties them off with your invoices, easy to see profit and expenses for each month. well worth the monthly payment, my books have never been so easy to keep!
too much missing. the app could be useful, but is a pain. does not have an option to add bills, which is most of what i want to use it for. constantly asks for password rather than touch id, making it a pain to use, or worse - encourages you to use a simple password. hopefully both will get fixed soon.
owner. terrible , there is no estimates workable , also 85 % of desktop does not show i have been in desktop for years and wanted to use both not any more
help. hate trying to get help this way, but my app keeps crashing. i love my online version, but basically i can’t do anything with the app. would make my life so much easier if i could
it's ok not super. i'd like to have the ability to creat checklists and forms that aren't effectively invoice like. i also don't like intuit screwing with their databases and allowing some invoices and expenses to go missing from my account.
very happy with app. the app is very good, and provides a lot of useful information that can be sent anytime, anywhere.
awesome. this app is so good i'm so glad i have it i would be lost with out it
awesome app. this app really helps me keep track of all my transactions for my pool business. easy to use and has everything i need.
bugs. there are alot of bugs in the app. i am about to go back to square. the app keep giving alot of errors.
great for billing while traveling. this app is very hearty. i was worried how it would work from the ipad but it was so easy. let's me bill while i'm on the road so that i can keep my cash flow in order. great job, inuit!
excellent tool for my biz. since i got this app on my phone i hardly need to go to the office, or open my laptop. love it!
prettt good. it’s a good app, i’d have given it 5 stars but the sequential number doesn’t load when using the app. this means to produce an invoice you have to go back and look up the last invoice number.
so frustrating. update 12/16/17 still having the same issues after reinstalling the app on multiple devices...it always says “unable to get all of your qb data. pull down to refresh your page.” this always happens after the first successful login were i don’t get this kind of message. i’ll wait until this year is over and switch back to other more reliable solutions. old review: yes, the app is helpful and you can track your money, invoicing and stuff. but i’m so sick of always having issues with either login or messages in the app that they can’t show detailed information about my transactions because of some issue they have. sometimes i can fix it when i login again but that’s not a solution and $15 per month are just to expensive to have a buggy app running my finances. sorry...if that goes on i switch back to wave app which is not a s convenient but it’s at least free and i never had problems like this.
great company. starting up a new business has been a confusing journey. quickbooks has helped me get through a lot of the pain of how to take payments and handle expenses and such. would definitely recommend.
great app. being able to use quickbooks on my phone has really helped my business run more efficiently. i'm able to manage customers and employees all from my phone.
best business finance management app period!. bomb-diggity
owner, billing, etc.. i read the reviews after i started the free trial. i have to say, that so far the app is a good fit for me. most of my business is due upon services rendered. the app seems as though it will work fine for keeping track of those clients and how much they pay for my services.
great app. easy to use very helpful!!!!!
won't open. i use this app daily and now it won't open! please fix this!
latest version is a disaster. face recognition does not work at all. you have to sign in every time you open the app and often get kicked out especially when switching between companies. colossal waste of time.
if it worked.... won't load my bank balance in the app i have to do it on the laptop, it's frozen twice and can't connect to qb online. had it 12 hours so far
problems. the app have now problems i recommend to check that i was using the app for 3 years but now is a disaster
my everyday app. love how easy this app is to use
a waste of time. no payroll functions. a big area to not include. i still need my computer to pay staff. missing other features. should be a full functioning app.
what's happened?!. usually excellent for uploading expenses it's now decided not to communicate with my online account. i can see all my expenses in the app but not online. so now, do i do it all again online? scan every receipt individually? or do i wait until it perhaps decides to work? i really don't want to then have to remove everything if it doubles up! pls fix :(
great app.. not as good as desktop. its amazing app and each update is awesome. but it's not as near the desktop in terms of functionality. overall, if you use quickbooks then its a must have..
very well designed. since the dawn of tablets i’ve been patiently waiting for tablets and apps to be able to handle larger programs. because of quickbooks easy and convenient app. i have converted my business to all ipads. it has not only been an amazing tool for time management and popping out quick quotes. but is a big reason into my cost savings going from expensive laptops to ipads.
so simple and quick to use. i have downloaded the app and have been using it for my self employed hairdressing. it is so easy to use and because i use my phone often it's great to pick it up at the end of the day and track my takings in which means i never have to worry about not being up to date. i would highly recommend this to anyone who wants an easy and simple way to keep detailed accounts!
literally crashes every time i try to enter a sale.. great for tracking expenses but useless for processing and tracking sales. very disappointed.
love quickbooks - improvement always appreciated. i really live the ease of use of quickbooks. the desk top and mobile app are pretty clean. keep building off such a great product. the down side is that some transactions such as bundling downloaded client reimbursable expenses & linking to a single invoice are not intuitive.
not accurate. the data on the app does not match the data on my computer when logged into qbo. this gets worse with the more time that passes by. the only way to fix this, at least temporarily, is to uninstall the app from my phone and reinstall it again. that is a real pain! i will now delete the app all together!,
changed the way we do business. i love this app. we needed something that we could easily use in the field. we can create estimates, invoices, receive payments and even attach check images to those payments. our productivity has skyrocketed. quickbooks has figured out the mobile accounting software. customers for life.
"love the convenience. love the app, but please add an option for ""inclusive tax"". so easy to build and send invoices, post payments, create estimates, etc....."
newest update. loved the app until the newest update. now for some reason i can no longer receive payments from my phone. which is very frustrating. i have closed out the app, restarted my phone and still can't do it.
bank transactions not loaded. there are several limitations with this app. but my major issue is the inability to load bank transactions. the connected bank account goes sometimes for weeks or months without the transactions transferred to qb. other times they are uploaded every couple of days. there is no option to upload the transactions manually through the app. i called customer service but no one helped. this makes the phone app pretty much useless.
cant even start the app. how to rate a app that not even running
crashing app. latest update crashes constantly on iphone 11 pro. fix it.
access. this app is great. it is so nice to be out in the field looking at a project and make an estimate right then and there while things are fresh in your mind. not to mention for the quick service call we are able to make our invoice right there and present it when we are complete with the work. aloha po'okela lawn service kailua, hawaii
intuit disappoints. i've been a qbo user for 32 months now and run my whole one-man business on it. each app version is a bit better than the last and they do fix bugs when notified. i continue to be happy to see intuit continue to improve the app and the web interface. however, the latest change, the revision of the invoice and estimate forms, is a total mess. fields aren't wide enough and user data gets merged and crammed together. completely unprofessional forms pushed out to users without warning or recourse.
app has connectivity issues. anytime i log into the app it causes me to have to re-link my bank accounts every time. if i stay out of the app everything works appropriately. i can log onto different devices through the browsers without issue but the second i log onto the app on a tablet or phone, it will disconnect my bank accounts.
"update broke the app. since the update i have to type my password each time i open it after it has been closed for a while. this doesn't work in front of customers. (yes, i enabled touchid. the problem seem to be hitting others and is based on now intuit decided to ""fix"" touchid by breaking it in this version)"
great mobile app. this app is perfect for my business. i'm out of the office majority of the day so being able to send or create estimates and invoices is very nice. quick and easy
great as an assistant to the desktop version.. i've found this app to be a great mobile partner to the full desktop (or online) version. there's a couple functions that aren't available in the app but everything you do need is easily available. i can't connect my bank account because my (non us) bank isn't listed but being able to input expenses as they happen is a great way of keeping updated accounts. reconciliation is a breeze afterwards. it's a great app.
david hall. great app , excellent for small business
great. i’m loving this app
great app!. i love the mobility of the app. it helps me stay on top of my bookkeeping work while i'm on the go. makes managing multiple businesses that much easier!
super unintuitive and cumbersome. wow you would have thought this saas company would have it together. does anyone in your company actually run a business and use quickbooks? probably not considering how poorly designed this app is. why can you only add an receipt to a transaction after it has been categorised as an expense or income? does it make sense to add the receipt when the transaction is being defined so you can look at what type of expense it is on the receipt? the desktop version has this feature but you have to first upload all your receipts to your computer. i'm lolling all the way to xero. good riddance after 2 years this is the nail in the coffin.
latest update is disappointing. i am on qb on my iphone off and on all day. the new update has me logging in nearly every time. very frustrating. the release notes indicate that its purpose is to fix bugs with the pin and fingerprint logins. it has become much worse. when i add a customer, i am unable to find that customer in my list.
"quickbooks on-line has many software issues. as a decade long quickbooks user. we upgraded to the quickbooks + nearly as soon as it was released. this option allowed for mobile device support. worked great. then with a 30day noticed we were switched to qbo and this app. this is where our love affaire with quickbooks ended. the program has give us hundreds of hours of lost productivity, spent on the phone following red dot with tech support only to be told ""this issue needs to be upgraded to programming"" or something of the sort. system will go offline making all your information unavailable during the day. new and constant programming issues with nearly every update. issues have cost us thousands with our cpa trying to resolve issues caused by qbo. btw- our cpa firm says the same, qbo is a problem for many of their clients, resulting in a lot more billing hours for them. bank account suddenly stop syncing, sometimes for days or weeks at a time. credit cards will process, but not register to banking at time, throwing off banking balances. extremely limited on invoice or estimate layouts and designs. in ability to customize fields. first time we tried to print a check register in reverse order, program reversed the order on who the checks where written to, but not the amounts, so nothing corresponded. another programming issue. for over a decade we encouraged fellow businesses to use quickbooks. with qbo, we highly discourage this unless you prefer spending hundreds of hours trying to correct qbo related and caused issues."
awesome. love this app!! so easy and quick to use
best app for my business!. not a good app when it doesn't download your banking, nor did it make good invoices/estimates. i love invoicesasap, but this app needs help.
experience getting worse. entering transaction requires way too many taps. it isn’t location aware to suggest transactions you just always search. recent updates have some bug that makes the app download the data file with almost every login and login often you must. usually twice a week it loses my password. i have enjoyed quickbooks online but this app experience may have me evaluating competitors in december.
app does not function properly on ios13. updated to ios13, immediately after, quickbooks app version 19.9.2 stopped allowing me to save invoice payments from clients, and stopped slowing me to bill labor...giving me all sorts of various errors. i’ve deleted and reinstalled the app, i’ve logged out and back in. i’ve rebooted. nothing resolves. i’m going two days of not being able to run my business and have folks enter their labor in the field, or accept payments from clients because of this issue. i’ve reported it to intuit twice already. fingers crossed for a fix by monday.
it's about time!. quickbooks online and the cloud sync apps for iphone and ipad is nothing short of amazing...it's about time and wow they did such an amazing job with the whole experience. i love that i can make a receipt for a customer on the spot on my iohone or ipad.
don’t use the pay options.. app is great but don’t use the pay option. it took a week for the money to hit my account.
confusing. i used the trial a little while ago, and sort of went off it. just renewed the subscription now with the exact the same email, but quickbooks somehow created a new company instead! the support for backing up the company’s data is all over the place, since there are so many variants of the software/app.
many issues.... most of the time they come up with an update it does not work well after we update the app. they should test this updates before releasing it.
life saver. one my favorite apps to use while working. i’m on it like a social media page. thanks quick books.
can't save to send out invoices. i've used qb since 2000. always satisfied. just today the iphone app is not working accordingly. the app is not saving my invoices, which then allows me to send to clients. i tried customer service. all i got was ringing and transfers to other ringing. not sure what has hanged now i'm sitting here with no way to send out my monthly invoices.
"online version---not user friendly. i got this app under the advice of my cpa but i have been pulling my hair out making entries and editing categories. if you are not an a person well versed on all the ""ins and outs"" of this software good luck! quicken has its idiosyncrasies but i will take it any day over quick books! the staff at quickbooks is super patient and if you need help but i have had to call them several times to for simple entries! very frustrated from austin, texas"
do not update to ios 13. if you rely on the app, don’t update to ios 13 until they make it compatible. it crashes on startup after face id.
very useful!. this app allows me to send clients a sales receipt as soon as they hand me the cash, invaluable when visiting clients.
get it together, quickbooks. as a small business owner, quickbooks is a crucial part of our daily work. invoicing, estimates, managing our money. since moving from the desktop version of quickbooks, we have had a daily dose of glitchy, unreliable service while using this software. and it seems the glitches are persistent and long-lived. if quickbooks can get their act together and resolve these constant problems, they may regain my confidence for reliability -- particularly when it comes to handling the money of our business. for example, i often get a the login page and message when opening the program from the app on my computer which tells me it's twice as fast to login if i download the app. uh, what? i am opening the program from the downloaded app... very frustrating. often the software will not respond to clicking on items... while in the downloaded app -- creating estimates or invoices. this delay and glitchiness can cost a small owner like me business because i can't respond quickly enough... booting and rebooting quickbooks is not a solution. all that to say, their competition is worse. so regardless, i have to say i feel like we have no choice but to tolerate the poor programming and pray that one day they'll get it together... just be ready to be frustrated.
cancelar assinatura. fiz uma pergunta sobre cancelar assinatura e responderam algo na com nada. será que vocês podem responder como cancelo a assinatura, pois não utilizarei o app? aguardo um retorno obrigado
great app. helps make my business more efficient. this is a great tool for small business owners who are on the go. making invoices, estimates and tracking expenses with my iphone helps make things much more efficient. i wish there was a way to track hst, and generate simple reports within the app. automatic text recognition would be an awesome feature as well.
no security with ios 13.0 update.. nice to have the app working again .. too bad it opens without the required password. shoddy update.
great idea, but not full version. as a long-term user, i expected more from the app than it has. i still have to use my pc for some of the essential functions such as payables, reports, and payroll. disappointed!
nice apps. nice apps
poor need lots of work. this app is terrible on the ios and android. i’m using it on both and it has tooo many bugs...
great app. yet again another update and even more glitches, you charge a fortune and cannot provide a decent service - i’m considering switching to a competitor as you have breached the contract that you have with me. this needs fixing urgently and you need to refund subscription fees! my advice to businesses and the self-employed is do not use quickbooks!
excellent app!. anything that can please my accountant and help me stay organised gets my vote!
crashes upon opening. do not install. keep your prior version until they fix this. upon updating the app no longer will open. i called quickbooks and they said it must be a known issue then.
working great, love dashboard. app is easy to use on the go. some things are better done on desktop but for the most part can do a invoice from phone and accept payments. would be nice if inventory feature wasn't additional cost
everything i need at my fingertips. the app is great for my service business, especially when a prospective client calls needing immediate help. there is no need to head to my office to start a client file before billing them. everything can happen is seconds, on site, as they watch. and i can send them a receipt showing the balance paid before i back out of the driveway.
it's glitchy!. although it fulfills the need of having the ability to create estimates on the spot and re-send invoices quickly, it has glitches which are frustrating. on occasion it stalls and goes out of the app requiring you to log on several times and even restart your phone before be able to access the app.
unable to login via iphone/ipad. every time i try and login from my iphone or ipad it tells me no account associated with the given information. but when i login via a web browser with the exact same information i have no problem. basically defeating the purpose of the app. fix asap please
since last update app is glitchy. usually this app works great but since last update it has a couple glaring glitches that make it less then desirable to use.
horrible customer service. horrible customer service
great little app. excellent app for basic book keeping invoicing etc and keep up with the book keeping on the fly. but to do the serious stuff you still need to work from a laptop or desktop.
love it!. this app is great. i can almost do everything i need to on it. great way to check accounts on the go.
never disappointed. best accounting software available!
crash with ios13. app does not launch.
"issues. it was working fine on my ipad up until last week. then starting bugging. not all customer transaction appear on the mobile app. called customer service about it. they told me that they were ""working on it"". we shall see. i pay for it monthly...i asked if i still had to pay this month even though it's not working as advertised...answer was yes. not happy with that answer. i will keep you posted. bob"
best version yet!!. i run a company with revenues over 2 million dollars annually with qb. i can take care of everything i need from invoicing, estimating and accounts payable to payroll and everything in between. the app adds even more flexibility by not requiring my laptop or tablet to create these. the reports and reconciliations are second to none.
terrible app. keeps crashing. keeps dumping you out telling you that “critical updates “ and must login again. try to login and - am a very long-time customer - it tells you your company is non-existent. ba humbug. complain to intuit and they say use a “supported” device. in other words: don’t use the app. time to find software other than quick books.
great invoicing and management tool. awesome tool to keep your small business running at its best. highly automated, making it very easy to work with.
i like it. i like it good app
great app would be useful to do bills on it though. reminder email doesn't work on app
great app for accounting on the go!. i don't know why people are disappointed in this app-- it's an app, not an entire accounting software. plus it's free! i love this app. i can create, manage & send invoices on the go. that's all i need to do. it has a simple interface. kudos to qb.
this has never worked. i have had this app installed for over four months now and i have never been able to login. it keeps returning server busy try again. the servers been busy for over four months! i can login in the pc and via safari without any issues so i know my details are correct. my colleague has had the same issue with her ipad and iphone, for even longer than i have. it would of been a really useful app, if it ever works!
great, easy to use quickbooks app. so many great features with this app, love it. so easy to use!
useless for sure. qbo is useless. can’t login with google account. forces me to create a new/separate password. can’t really access qbo via a browser on ipad. overall terrible experience. i’m sure it’s equally apple and qbo fault.
great app but. we need to have the ability to track mileage within the online version. also need to be able to auto fill a lot of data over to turbotax and allow it to do personal property taxes. i think the cost of this service is high for compared to the desktop version of which you can do more with. please work on the updates and continue to offer a great product.
quickbooks. super easy to use! i was able to backlog and bring my business up to speed with quickbooks within a few hours after downloading quickbooks! operating the app is fun and accessible!
great business tool. i just started my business this year and it's amazing how easy it is to track all of my expenses. quickbooks automatically syncs with my credit card and bank account, then categorizes each transaction and displays it in an easy to read graph. exploring outside of the main page you can also get a break down of each expense by month, year, quarter, or you can make a custom search. there are a fees bugs where it won't categorize some transactions correctly like shipping costs. overall great product for only $10 a month.
seabreeze sealants. awesome app, makes running our business quick & easy in all aspects, we are able to stay in control of cash flow and invoices. highly recommend 👌🤙
great app!. an awesome compliment to the web version. addition of balance sheet would be beneficial. cheers!
pretty but not functional. it's bizarre how the graphics continue to be improved but the functionality doesn't. i've been trying to use this app for years but the features i need on the go are missing such as timekeeping. mostly this app seems to work a lot like you would imagine quicken mobile to work, by being able to look up past banking transactions. but i can do that on my banking apps for free already.
great app, easy to use!. this is a great financial management app. i'm far from an accountant but once you have your chart of accounts set up, keeping track of expenses and income is a breeze! a few swipes of your finger and you can reconcile your bank accounts. if only more things were this easy!
i love quickbooks online. i love quickbooks online & my accountant does also. this app is really good for doing your expenses on but as far as invoicing i still do it on the computer. it's very handy for a small business. the fact you can enter an expense, take a picture of the receipt & go on your merry way. i'm sold.
dashboard is broken. app needs work.. the app dashboard appears to throw up numbers completely unrelated to reality and almost always reports inability to retrieve all data. the web version, on the other hand, works fine. it seems not much attention has been put into app development. disappointing.
almost impossible to back up data. beware... intuit has made it almost impossible to back up your data. to back up on a windows machine (backup isn’t possible with the app), you have to install internet explorer, which is now an outdated browser. then you have to disable all security on the browser and install an active x control. then you have to sign into qbo using this insecure browser and request a download. the first time i did this it took hours to get it to work right. and each time i do a backup i have to reinstall the active x control through a laborious process. since qbo has a near monopoly in accounting they really have to incentive to make their products work properly. they don’t want you to have your data and can’t be bothered to create a modern download process. the thing that can be done with a click on your bank’s website requires hours of frustration with qbo. come on intuit get this fixed!
great app. very good photo function. so, no need to save receipt.
time saver. our customers are loving our new system
all you need to run a business.. awesome app. all your accounting needs are build into the app. very easy to use.
amazing app. amazing app that functions well enough to keep track of and coordinate your business.
good for the $$$ needs more features. need to be able to write and view purchase orders from the app. also be able to see the cost of inventory items. not just list price
great for invoicing out but that’s it. was hoping this was the answer to our accounting. it’s quick and easy to send invoices and take pics of your receipts but when it comes to inputting invoices you receive from your suppliers it’s a huge let down!! waste of time
app problems. app keeps crashing haven’t been able to create invoices for days
great for my business. this app has been an absolute vital part in helping me run my business. i love it!
useless. can’t share the online app with my accountant. frustrating and useless!!!! i got an email back from the development team. thanks for the response but the review stands. you have an app that represents itself as qb online. it does not say that it has severe limitations to the browser based version of qb online. further, there are no help files that tell you what functionality is not included in the app version. so.... yes, you can accomplish a task but not in the app ... which defeats the entire purpose of having an app other than some marketing, talking head said you needed one so some half hearted attempt was made at providing one. congratulations! you frustrated your user and made your marketing department wonder why they are losing market share to other providers. i develop software too. if i made apps like yours, i’d be out of a job.
getting better and better. the app was mediocre a couple of yard ago but still useful. it's getting more polished and even better now. good app!
bookkeeping on the go. i own a small tax and accounting firm and this app has done wonders for customer service! being able to give my clients real time information from anywhere at anytime is a huge plus! i only wish this app would allow me to process ach and credit card payments on the fly!
love it!. quickbooks has changed the way we invoice and track expenses. the ability to provide estimates then convert to invoices is amazing. the mobile app allows me to work on the go.
makes accounting much simpler. i've been using this app for a few months and find it to be really easy and accommodating. the app when used in conjunction with my desktop program helps to alleviate a lot of ambiguity and oversight.
"awesome app. used quickbooks for a number of years professionally and this app gives my clients awesome flexibility to do ""do"" their bookkeeping on the move. i recommend it to all my clients."
paid for subscription but no access. apple says they sent the payment quickbooks says they never received it.... revolving door with neither party willing to help. pay directly through quickbooks if your going to buy.
newest update is nothing but problems. can no longer update estimates. freezes and have to close app. also cannot see new estimates fellow employees have created. app ran perfectly prior to the update. intuit needs to launch new update asap or they are losing my business.
not intuitive, not flexible, once in your stuck. terrible decision for a simple accounting software. converted from computer version...very unhappy.
mgrm. great app. useful and easy to use.
recent changes. i love the app! very helpful when i am out and about .. why did it recently change - making all entries for customers the same. i can no longer see what invoices are open or overdue. this has to come back!!!
critical update!. i was just in the middle of a really long material list and a notification came up that there were critical updates to the app. clicked on ok.... lost everything! not impressed. there was no option to ignore or update later. according to the app update description it was just minor bug fixes etc, etc.
good but needs more. i love this app and use it every day - it has taken me from doing my accounts once a year and being ridiculously late with invoicing, to on the spot invoicing and totally up to date with everything ... except receiving payments
app. best app
iphone x and ipad pro app crashing/no login. the app has had intermittent issues where it logs you out every once in a while causing you to close the app, re-login and you were okay for a day or so and it would do it again. now it doesn’t work at all. i cannot remote login to my qbo account from an ios device. the whole reason i went with qb online 7 years ago was to get access whenever and wherever i needed to of my business. currently running a $4m business on your app and now looking at alternatives to move the business too. this has been an issue for nine months now. get it fixed!!!!
too many clicks for attachments. i keep track of all transactions by taking pictures of the receipt, checks, deposit receipts, and just about everything then attach them to the transaction. with the user interface rule of thumb of three clicks access to specific functions, attachments can take as many as five to six clicks to save a picture, which is very annoying and time consuming.
purchased but won’t work.. i can not contact customer service to save my life!! i purchased this after my trial but it won’t acknowledge that i have. very upset and frustrated!!!
it does the job, no need to look elsewhere. i've trialled a few accounting apps but none of them quite did what i wanted. being an accountant i wanted to find a product that i would use myself and more importantly it needs to be user friendly so the non accountants can use it too. my clients love being able to snap receipts in while they are out and and about, rather than having to find motivation to catch up with the bookkeeping all in one go at the home. with quickbooks you have your accounts team with you in your pocket! customer service is excellent and the product is improving all the time.
download app just to be taken to the browser.. not the self employed version.
awesome app, love quickbooks. use it often to add expenses and check bank data. nice feature of receipt photo, works great
not a replacement. not fast. doesn't sync well.. this app needs a lot of work to be reliable and usable. no matter how many times i sync it doesn't actually sync to the web apps data. it keeps logging me off the fingerprint option. this might be designed in there because human fingerprints change very often? correct?
love the app!. absolutely love this app. i can do everything on my phone on the go and hardly ever need to pull up qb on my computer. beautiful lay out, intuitive design and easy to use.... i'd rate it an a+ 👍
great app but limited. love the app and how easy it is to use. would love to be able to input expenses, would make it a 5 star app for me then!
good value for money. happy with the program and functionality across varied devices
ios 13. app crashes before opening! please fix asap!
terrible app. absolutely terrible, even harder to cancel, don’t buy
breathtaking!!. wow this is an incredible app. i have searched for personal finance software for a long time and it has been a major headache. using quickbooks online is amazing. if they continue to add features to the online product to rival their desktop version i recommend they move completely to the cloud!! so good.
wish i could charge cards on file. love the app, just wish i could input new customer's card information and charge the existing customer's cards on file when accepting payments so i could do my accounting from anywhere.
excellent software. best products, excellent customer service, can't imagine how i would manage without it. thanks quickbooks!!!
