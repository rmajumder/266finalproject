19.12.0.12,1,1/31/20,"Customers Service, Quality",Not intuitive. Bad customer satisfaction services.
20.0.1,1,1/31/20,"Customers Service, Price","I just want to upload an image as an attachment to an invoice. I also want the app to read the invoice and track mileage. Ohh, that's only on the cheaper self employed version that is severely stunted. In the 3 years I've been using qb, it's almost doubled in price and almost nothing has improved. Finally, when I request phone help from the phone app, why do I get a rep who knows nothing about the phone app? Where the request comes from isn't logged on the system so the right person can call!"
20.0.1,5,1/31/20,General,Wow this is a fantastic program I am a new small business owner. I have learned aso much just by using this app!
19.12.0.12,4,1/31/20,Dashboard,Good apart from the top of the dashboard on the home page being greyed out.
19.12.0.12,5,1/31/20,General,Very good
20.0.1,5,1/31/20,General,Easy to use and my Accountant recommended it highly.

,1,1/30/20,Quality,Unless you are truly tech savvy avoid this app since finding help was as bad as getting help from FB or Instagram in my opinion.
19.12.0.12,5,1/30/20,"General, Experience",Kinda tricky at first but easily learned
19.12.0.12,1,1/30/20,"Quality, Customers Service",Switch to Xero even though its more expensive. Better off wasting money on a useless app. Cant even save a transaction. Lousy support and engineering team to not resolve such a essential feauture after 1 month. Subscribe at your own risk.
20.0.1,2,1/29/20,Quality,"Love QB, but this app is really glitchy. Asks for password, loops me back, won't let me activate fingerprint. I'm signed in using Google, when I click on my Google account it asks for my password, when I enter password, it puts me in a loop. The only fix is uninstalling and then reinstalling the app. Which I have to do daily. It's incredibly frustrating."

20.0.1,2,1/29/20,"General, Mileage, Quality",Great App but have had issues with mileage tracking freezing up while I am categorizing. It then kicks me out.

20.0.1,3,1/29/20,"General, Invoicing","I really love the convenience this app has given me and my business over the last couple years. However, this last update seems to have removed the ""send/resend invoice"" button on the invoice page. I have relaunched the app a couple times, but no improvement. Could you please fix this? On another note, at some point I would also love it if you could add the ""Create Bill"" feature that QuickBooks online has."
20.0.1,5,1/28/20,General,"Amazing app, I literally use it everyday. You need this app if you have your own business."
,2,1/28/20,"Quality, Customers Service","It keeps logging out of my bank, and also deleted a lot of what I logged from last year.. now I dont have the correct information that I need... not very happy with this quickbooks app..."

19.12.0.12,5,1/27/20,Global,Why this app is not in french ???
19.12.0.12,1,1/27/20,General,"Very disappointed that once the app downloads popup advertising constantly appears on the phone. Not only does it just come up on a screen, but no matter what app you may be in you will be diverted to quickbooks app and then diverted to their advertisers page. VERY ANNOYING! Especially in time sensitive situations like login situations on other sites, or snapchat. I am seriously considering deleting the app if they don't fix this problem soon."

20.0.0,5,1/27/20,"General, Experience, Help",I love how easy quick books is to learn but it can be quite confusing at times. The tutorials in you tube and on the Intuit website are super helpful. There are so many things you can accomplish so much faster when you discover the correct path to take. I had some accounting experience and understand the logistics but getting deeper into the realm of bookkeeping and advanced accounting principals has proven to be a challenge to say the least but I'm determined to keep at it until I'm an expert!!
,3,1/27/20,"General, Banking","I liked it.. I just logged into my bank account from this app and all myvanking info was there like my investments, chequeing and savings accounts all in 1 place... It's more for business people and you have 2 pay monthly fees"

Edit - the login issue persisted for about a week. Uninstall/clear cache etc did nothing. Waiting it out was all that helped. QB development often release updates without proper testing. Updates are usually followed by further updates, so be aware, and delay updating if all seems to be working on your current version."

Bought QB 16th Dec 2019 and cant get a call back from an English speaker to help me with set up despite multiple attempts! Why is Sales UK based but Support isnt? This is 2nd review - 1st disappeared!!! So disappointed and very desperate to get started. I can login to QB Online but says Im in USA not UK. I have emailed you twice now. Still no reply.
,3,1/18/20,"Estimates, Invoicing",So you should be able to use the same #for an invoice as an estimate. The size of he invoice / estimate # should be in a larger font. Should have the option to call map etc the customer from in the invoice w/o having to back out and go into the customer and then call. The option to move a customer from estimate to invoice and back again ( with the same # ) would be extremely helpful.

19.12.0.12,1,1/17/20,"Banking, Customer Service",Update has NOT fixed this issue! Why can't I see bank account details in the app? You can on the iOS app contacted help desk who couldn't help! Without access to accounts the app is effectively useless. I have done everything you suggest. Home screen is now blank! So even worse than when I started. I have also contacted support with no solution as yet.
19.12.0.11,5,1/17/20,General,This app is simple and really easy to use. Makes my job way easier.
19.11.0.7,4,1/17/20,General,Helps to keep our business running. Love the mobile ability
19.12.0.12,2,1/17/20,Customers,This app is basically useless. It doesn't show all of the information in the customer and vendor profiles so if I'm trying to look anything up with my phone I had to go onto the actual website in my phones browser to find anything I need. Why even make the app if it's not going to show you everything?
,5,1/17/20,General,I love the simple features on the app.

I I have yet to have my QuickBooks reconciled in any type of way. It is so messed up. I've gone through four different accountants. On top of that, there was a bug, I did get reimbursed for the payroll aspect of it, but have not yet been able to utilize the actual program I am paying for. It definitely does not show up on this app either. I am so frustrated."

19.12.0.12,5,1/16/20,General,I'm completely new to this app. Because of that I might not know what to look for. But this makes starting up a business extremely easy. Definitely plan on subscribing once the trial is up. 👍And would gladly suggest this app to anyone looking for this kind of help and ease.

19.12.0.11,1,1/15/20,Receipt Capture,"Worst app ever!!! When logged in only options are help, feedback and something else so unnecessary. You're suppose to be able to scan your receipts .. nope! Hi Kyle, since I am unable to reply to you I am editing my review and answering you here. No, it does not allow me to scan My receipt. It allows you to do nothing on the app except for access help , feedback. My husband has the same app on this phone and yes he's able to upload receipts etc."
,1,1/15/20,"General, Customers Service",After eading all the problems and seeing 90% of the reviews being 1 star im going to save a headache on this scam app should be taken off the market or sued for false advertising and costing people thousands of dollars. All the responses from support sound like they are prewritten for the complaints. Please take app off the market and quit ruing the admin side of peoples hard work to start a business.

19.12.0.9,1,1/14/20,"General, Customers Service",At first I thought this was a great app. And a good program. Now I'm finding out more and more that it sucks. Beware you will never be able to talk to anybody. When you have a problem they want you to ask other people that have this program. You cannot talk to anybody at all. They misdirect you through loops. Soon as I finish collecting on invoices I have open I will close this account and never use it again. Highly recommend to find a better app and a better program. This is a joke...
19.12.0.11,3,1/14/20,"Dashboard, Customers Service",1/13/20 update - Issue resolved but shouldn't have taken this many weeks. 1/7/20 Update - I had used the mobile app for Android for quite a long time with no issue and then approximately one month ago after an update the dashboard no longer has any information and is blank. I can still see activity but there's no way to get to customers or any of the other functions. I've emailed previously with no response. Previous review: Works well for viewing quickbooks info and taking payments
19.12.0.9,1,1/13/20,"Dashboard, Quality","Similar issues as Gillian, Dashboard blank, constant error messages on mobile. I also ended up accidentally reinstalling a slightly different version and was paying double!! I didn't realize there were two very similar apps!!

I am organized now, and everything is handled for professionally."

Make me lost two days trying to cancel it and then even charge me the month and did not give back my money. They went from 17 dollars a month to 40 dollars per month! Don't never quickbooks

But of all the options QB is the cheapest, so I guess it's this or go somewhere else and pay more money to have an accounting program perform slightly more than basic functions."

I have used this for over 3 years and one thing that seems to be VERY consistent is the phone app is boo boo. It never pulled data accurately. Whenever I need to pull overdue invoices for a client, the app fails (it will not show them). I have to pull over and pull out my computer. That's stupid. Intuit has tremendous resources and they always have various bugs and the app has always been slow."

19.12.0.11,2,1/12/20,"Experience, Quality","Not user friendly, disappointing, easier to log into my bank. Home page cuts off ability to view all accounts AND their balances. Cannot organize or sort homepage. Account balances are not updated frequently enough, last update was over 16 hours ago. Liked QuickBooks self-employed version. Changes I made on desktop version did not come through on app. Waste of time to use."

Then you leave page and find that multiple invoices have been created, UGH. 2,There is only a name slot for new customer entry, no first, last name.

You can print off everything else, just not that.

Very well thought out design and it appears that most of the functions are right at my fingertips. Not so. I have used it mostly for categorizing expenses. I was trying to run a report, but nothing really made sense. I went first to google to look for some tutorial videos, but it appears that most of the videos available online are only advertisements. That is when I went to the help and support section in app. In the section there is a FAQs area. Perfect! When I read the only article in this section I thought it must be some kind of joke. It was an article on how to get to the FAQs section on the app. It is like some perverted Groundhog Day scene, or like when you are reviewing a resume for a potential new hire and one of the sections is the filler text from the template they created the resume from. I expect more from this company. Fix this or simply remove it."

I’ve continually notified Intuit about this since the problem started in April of 2019. The consistent response is that they close out the ticket same day and never respond or research the issue. 
Today I’m told that they no longer have a department to help customers with the app. 
Now I’ve just recently renewed my annual subscription so I’m out that money because this product is unreliable."

To do this transition you will need an old computer with windows 7 and IE11 32 Bit. Totally ridiculous and Intuit looks does not care about this issue and left their customers alone with the issue. It’s a shame.

I’m based in US but invoice in UK, Mexico and Spain and with QuickBooks you have to be 100% one currency so it’s a pain for my customers and makes me look second rate as a “in global” business"
20.01.4,5,1/29/20,"general,quality,experience",I was hesitant to change the way I was doing things and use quickbooks when we switched to it a few years back.

20.01.3,1,1/26/20,"quality,design,experience,navigation,updates","DO NOT UPDATE! They really need to go back to the previous version of this app. Every time they make an update it seems to be useless tweaks in navigation, font size and anything else that adds no value or functionality.

With the latest update, they literally removed Every feature I used to use- dashboard widgets, P&L, balance sheet, bank account updating-all gone. It’s now absolutely useless."

Be VERY careful when using the app for any material reporting.

UPDATE: Caitlyn, thanks but the hot links don’t work. I’ve searched for those articles on our community site and found nothing.

20.01.3,1,1/22/20,"quality,experience,customers service,data","Terrible, terrible support.

All in all the app is great for businesses but there should be a normal person standpoint. Meaning allowing people to track their receipts and then present them when taxes require so."

I quickly grabbed my computer to double check and all the expenses displayed correctly. 

If I open the P&L in the noble app, the expenses display there correctly as well. The issue just seems to be with the stand-alone expense widget with the chart.

Quickbooks support will tell you you can export some spreadsheets but they are incomplete. Attachments and receipts are not included. 

It seems the only way to properly keep my records if i happen to need them in the future is continue paying a monthly subscription.

You might look up the help section “Downgrade your Quickbooks online plan” and read If you think your current QuickBooks Online plan isn't the right fit for your business, don't worry. You can downgrade. But quite a way down the page it states

QuickBooks Online Simple Start doesn’t have a multi-currency feature. If you have this feature turned on in your current plan, you won’t be able to switch to Simple Start.

Get in touch with us so we can help.

On the featured list for Multi-currency in Essentials, there is No Mention of this restriction. Now you probably tried Essentials BECAUSE of the multi-currency. So you might be kind of annoyed to discover that when you get in touch, you will be told by the call centre employee in the Philippines, “No you cannot”. No explanation as to why not. By this stage you will have spent an hour and be REALLY ANNOYED, when you think how they might have simply stated this CLEARLY when you were easing their material promoting their product, when you were planning which one might suit you.

I’ll start by saying I’ve never taken any classes on business or economics, and as far as employment goes over the course of my adult life I’ve held jobs that require enough knowledge of basic accounting/billing, computer/software, (and other skills of the like) to get by on common sense. When it comes to taxes— that’s a foreign language to me and filing every year has been pretty simple (no major deductions, write-offs, etc. to worry about other than claiming dependents), so TurboTax is typically my go-to.

That said, and with this all being new to me, I’ve found that QuickBooks is surprisingly user-friendly and fairly easy to figure out. There are still a few things I look at and I’m like “huh?”, but the customer support is pretty on-point as easy to contact (and work with to get help from). Most of the App interface is self-explanatory and the layout is easy to follow— it’s comfortable, for lack of a better word.

Initially, I was going to rate this App at 5 stars because I’m diggin’ it so far... but decided to go with 4 for one reason only— I wish there were more options within the App (as opposed to the online version accessed from a desktop/pc). Too many times, I’ve found myself frustrated because something I want to (or need to) do requires you to log in and use the website and won’t allow the action from the App... and I can’t always get to a computer to do so.

In my opinion, if your programming isn’t overwhelmingly user friendly you should at least have an overwhelmingly good customer service experience to give us all hope that we can, one day, figure it out. I am stuck with this program because my husband finds it easy enough to create and send an invoice, but unfortunately this leaves me to figure out the rest once a month.

While using the desktop it don't appear to update dynamically and I often have to logout and in again just to perform a function mostly associated with banking and download.

Not liking it too much and will switch to alternative drop of a hat.

Otherwise it's pretty good. The TV marketing is targeted at tradesmen which is fine but it also works quite well with more complex business models. However, if your company is manufacturing and you need management accountancy information as a business management tool (as opposed to simple reporting to the tax authorities) this doesn't cut it.

Square is looking even better! 11/20/19 updated response to Quickbooks. The person was on the account and had full access. Again wasting time and money and horrible customer service.
19.11.2,1,11/19/19,customers service,"I ordered Quickbooks online via the App Store. Just as I was about to download, I realized it was the wrong thing I wanted. I called to cancel and I am currently on hold. The person took the call, I can hear all the conversations going on right now, I have been saying ‘hello, hello, hello’ and until now, no one has even answered the call. It’s 2 female voices and a male voice. One person has a cold or possible allergies as they are coughing. I have been on hold now for over 15 minutes. It appears that the person took the call, then forgot as I am neither on hold nor on mute.

I am still holding and no one has come to the phone, or has even realized that the phone is live. The female is talking about being real. 

Now the voices are getting closer to the phone. Had it not been that I want to make sure my account is not billed, I would have hung up. It took so long with the automated service to get this far, and now, no one is even answering the call. 

What I don’t understand is, do they not realize they are not getting any calls? And I am texting while on hold, do they not hear the tapping?

I am giving up right now. I hope this review is seen.

I was about to hang up when I heard the female voice say something about the phone. So I started pressing numbers, then I heard a male voice saying we’re closing at 9 o’clock. There was great laughter and talking, while I’m waiting on the phone. 

I am surmising that they meant to take the phone off the hook so as not to have calls, not realizing that someone was on the phone. 

Now there are more people in the room. Disgusting!

I am finally hanging up...over 30 minutes on the ‘phone, and no one came on. Today’s date 11/18/19. 9:19pm est."
19.11.2,1,11/19/19,price,"I have just started using this app in mid October and it is now Nov 18, 2019. When I first signed on, I was offered to use the app for three months at $12.49 per month as a special promotion. Of course I clicked “ok” since I felt to really see if this app would work for me I would need three months to test it.

My first impression of this app was good because it did help me to organized all of my income and expenses in a neat clean application. In fact, I was able to balance my money and found missing money . However, there where many time where I had to reset my phone because the app would freeze. This glitch prevented me from connecting my bank account and credit account to the app itself. I figured I’ll give it another month to see if this problem gets fixed, I’ll trust it with my account numbers. 

Today it only allows me a (read only) version of this app unless I pay the full 24.99 a month, but I’m only on my 2nd month of the promotion that I signed up for. I still would like to only pay $12.49 like I originally signed up for before I fully commit my entire business to use this app. I haven’t even connected my credit or bank accounts yet because it still freezes from time to time. I would not have entered all of my private information as well as my regular customer private information if I knew that intuit was going to go back on their offer on their promotion. This kind of deal does not inspire trust in using this app. I have a pic on my phone saying that this was the subscription I originally signed up for"

They go through a prompted list and when the instructions don’t match the program they are lost just like me. I have spent hours on the phone with them and never gotten n answer to my problems.

19.11.2,1,11/19/19,"subscription,price,data,compatibility,experience","After just starting my new business I spent a month with the software and enjoyed all the features it had to offer. However, when it came time to renew my subscription which I was prepared to do there was an issue with their billing system that didn’t allow me to subscribe. After spending over 8 hours on 4 different phone calls and chat support over 2 days the only solution they’ve offered is to export my data, create a new account, and re-enter all of my data by hand. Yep, that’s right, they have an import function but their export function doesn’t output in the proper format to import it back into their very own software! All they offered was 40% off a 6 month subscription for my trouble (a $60 value) to cover the day I spent troubleshooting with them and the day or 2 it will take to re-enter all of my customer, invoice, and expense data by hand.

Their customer support people were friendly but were just following basic troubleshooting and even the supervisor I spoke with at the end was unable to make any headway putting a credit card on my account. I’ll be checking out other solutions like Clientbooks since I don’t want to risk having my data being treated this way.

—In response to developer response below—
We tried that and in order to get the data out and “easily” back into Quickbooks Desktop I had to have a Windows 7 machine running a particular version of IE - seriously? We even went further and tried to have your data management team do the conversion for me and even that was impossible since in order to do so I would have to add them as a user to my company data and I can’t do that since I can’t subscribe to add any more data (and apparently neither can you). Honestly, it’s ridiculous that Intuit doesn’t allow the billing to be updated somehow by your backend team and are trying to make me jump through 100 hoops just to get back to where I was."

19.11.2,4,11/13/19,"banking,transaction,mileage","This is a great app with some unfortunate flaws. First, I love that they’ve added the mileage feature. I had to have the self employed app as well just for the mileage tracking. However, it is not always accurate and doesn’t always auto track. It will also put a random address and if you try to change the address, it doesn’t correct the appropriate amount of miles. You have to delete and manually add it. Also, you have to put in the right amount of miles when manually adding; it doesn’t calculate from the starting and ending point. So, if you don’t know the mileage off the top of your head, you have to go to another map and find out the distance. 
Second, I don’t recommend using the bank transfer feature. They hold the check for at least 4-5 days before releasing to your back so you’re looking at 7 days before the money shows up in your account."

10 months in to the subscription I log into the app on my phone and a screen pops up to say I no longer have a subscription. So I quickly sign up to a subscription l, the only option being a full price £12.99. 

A couple days later I realise I’ve accidentally signed up with my personal Apple ID. So I cancel that subscription and log on to the app on my work IPad to sign up again with my work Apple ID.

Only to find out that I’ve been charged twice for the same month, on two different Apple IDs. 

Now I’m stuck because I’ve got a £5.99 subscription that’s not registering me as being subscribed on QuickBooks. Ideally I don’t want to cancel it, because I’ll have to revert to a £12.99 subscription. 

I’ve been unable to send any invoices for the past three weeks or log any of my receipts. 

I’ve tried to contact Intuit. I’ve emailed them, they don’t respond. Tried the live chat, doesn’t work. Spoken to them on the phone. Says there’s nothing they can do, I have to chase Apple for a refund. I told them I could email screenshot proof of all the issues I’m having. They gave me an email address. I send an email and they don’t bother responding to me. 

I go to report the issue to Apple and there webpage tells me to contact Intuit!!

Terrible customer service. No interest in sorting the issue out.

Update: Got another email from Apple to say that I’d gone into another month of my subscription. I’ve now cancelled it. So I’ve now paid three months and not had access to the app. 

I phoned Intuit one final time to resolve the issue. The best they could offer me was to transfer my subscription to Intuit. A full price subscription with a 30 day trial. Exactly the same as any new customer. They couldn’t do anything to compensate for the time I’ve been paying and unable to use their service. So they’ve lost my me as a customer.
