"This app looks awesome.  Very well thought out design and it appears that most of the functions are right at my fingertips.  Not so.  I have used it mostly for categorizing expenses.  I was trying to run a report, but nothing really made sense.  I went first to google to look for some tutorial videos, but it appears that most of the videos available online are only advertisements.  That is when I went to the help and support section in app.  In the section there is a FAQs area.  Perfect!  When I read the only article in this section I thought it must be some kind of joke.  It was an article on how to get to the FAQs section on the app.  It is like some perverted Groundhog Day scene, or like when you are reviewing a resume for a potential new hire and one of the sections is the filler text from the template they created the resume from.  I expect more from this company.  Fix this or simply remove it.","App, Expenses, Quality, Customer Service"

Today I’m told that they no longer have a department to help customers with the app.

Transferring company file from online QuickBooks to TurboTax is only was possible by transferring the company file to desktop QuickBooks and from there to TurboTax. To do this transition you will need an old computer with windows 7 and IE11 32 Bit. Totally ridiculous and Intuit looks does not care about this issue and left their customers alone with the issue.

QuickBooks Online Simple Start doesn’t have a multi-currency feature. If you have this feature turned on in your current plan, you won’t be able to switch to Simple Start.

Get in touch with us so we can help.

On the featured list for Multi-currency in Essentials, there is No Mention of this restriction.  Now you probably tried Essentials BECAUSE of the multi-currency.

"I am a new business owner and so far this is working out quite well for me. I’ll start by saying I’ve never taken any classes on business or economics, and as far as employment goes over the course of my adult life I’ve held jobs that require enough knowledge of basic accounting/billing, computer/software, (and other skills of the like) to get by on common sense. When it comes to taxes— that’s a foreign language to me and filing every year has been pretty simple (no major deductions, write-offs, etc. to worry about other than claiming dependents), so TurboTax is typically my go-to.

That said, and with this all being new to me, I’ve found that QuickBooks is surprisingly user-friendly and fairly easy to figure out. There are still a few things I look at and I’m like “huh?”, but the customer support is pretty on-point as easy to contact (and work with to get help from). Most of the App interface is self-explanatory and the layout is easy to follow— it’s comfortable, for lack of a better word.

Initially, I was going to rate this App at 5 stars because I’m diggin’ it so far... but decided to go with 4 for one reason only— I wish there were more options within the App (as opposed to the online version accessed from a desktop/pc). Too many times, I’ve found myself frustrated because something I want to (or need to) do requires you to log in and use the website and won’t allow the action from the App... and I can’t always get to a computer to do so. Especially since I work in the service industry (not from home or in any other stationary place of business) and I’m always running around or on-site somewhere, so my phone is often all I have to work with. That’s it. Other than that, it’s pretty awesome!","App, Quality, Customer Service, Transactions"

So far I’m pretty unhappy with this app because I thought that I could use it to track my time while I was with a client with a timer.

This app needs serious attention.  After years of putting up with this hot mess I’m fed up and rarely use it any more.

I wouldn’t use this program if my accountant didn’t require it.  Updates totally screw me up as I have to relearn.  Latest update I can’t even put in a new deposit from several months ago because the program tells me the date is not valid.

"I am not an accountant by any means, but I was hoping Quickbooks Online would be easier to use for us average joes. Nothing about their program is intuitive- you are instead given loads of video tutorials and when that’s not enough you can call their Sales Department to get transferred to Customer Service (don’t try direct, it’s no use) who 9/10 times have thick foreign accents (which makes it even harder to understand the foreign accounting software) and if you’re lucky you get scripted answers with a side of sass. In my opinion, if your programming isn’t overwhelmingly user friendly you should at least have an overwhelmingly good customer service experience to give us all hope that we can, one day, figure it out. I am stuck with this program because my husband finds it easy enough to create and send an invoice, but unfortunately this leaves me to figure out the rest once a month.

"I ordered Quickbooks online via the App Store. Just as I was about to download, I realized it was the wrong thing I wanted. I called to cancel and I am currently on hold. The person took the call, I can hear all the conversations going on right now, I have been saying ‘hello, hello, hello’ and until now, no one has even answered the call. It’s 2 female voices and a male voice. One person has a cold or possible allergies as they are coughing. I have been on hold now for over 15 minutes. It appears that the person took the call, then forgot as I am neither on hold nor on mute.

I am still holding and no one has come to the phone, or has even realized that the phone is live. The female is talking about being real. 

Now the voices are getting closer to the phone. Had it not been that I want to make sure my account is not billed, I would have hung up. It took so long with the automated service to get this far, and now, no one is even answering the call. 

What I don’t understand is, do they not realize they are not getting any calls? And I am texting while on hold, do they not hear the tapping?

I am giving up right now. I hope this review is seen.

I was about to hang up when I heard the female voice say something about the phone. So I started pressing numbers, then I heard a male voice saying we’re closing at 9 o’clock. There was great laughter and talking, while I’m waiting on the phone. 

I am surmising that they meant to take the phone off the hook so as not to have calls, not realizing that someone was on the phone.

"I have just started using this app in mid October and it is now Nov 18, 2019.  When I first signed on, I was offered to use the app for three months at $12.49 per month as a special promotion. Of course I clicked “ok” since I felt to really see if this app would work for me I would need three months to test it.

My first impression of this app was good because it did help me to organized all of my income and expenses in a neat clean application. In fact, I was able to balance my money and found missing money .  However, there where many time where I had to reset my phone because the app would freeze. This glitch prevented me from connecting my bank account and credit account to the app itself.  I figured I’ll give it another month to see if this problem gets fixed, I’ll trust it with my account numbers.  

Today it only allows me a (read only) version of this app unless I pay the full 24.99 a month, but I’m only on my 2nd month of the promotion that I signed up for.  I still would like to only pay $12.49 like I originally signed up for before I fully commit my entire business to use this app.  I haven’t even connected my credit or bank accounts yet because it still freezes from time to time.

"After just starting my new business I spent a month with the software and enjoyed all the features it had to offer.  However, when it came time to renew my subscription which I was prepared to do there was an issue with their billing system that didn’t allow me to subscribe.  After spending over 8 hours on 4 different phone calls and chat support over 2 days the only solution they’ve offered is to export my data, create a new account, and re-enter all of my data by hand.  Yep, that’s right, they have an import function but their export function doesn’t output in the proper format to import it back into their very own software!  All they offered was 40% off a 6 month subscription for my trouble (a $60 value) to cover the day I spent troubleshooting with them and the day or 2 it will take to re-enter all of my customer, invoice, and expense data by hand.

Their customer support people were friendly but were just following basic troubleshooting and even the supervisor I spoke with at the end was unable to make any headway putting a credit card on my account.

—In response to developer response below—
We tried that and in order to get the data out and “easily” back into Quickbooks Desktop I had to have a Windows 7 machine running a particular version of IE - seriously?  We even went further and tried to have your data management team do the conversion for me and even that was impossible since in order to do so I would have to add them as a user to my company data and I can’t do that since I can’t subscribe to add any more data (and apparently neither can you).  Honestly, it’s ridiculous that Intuit doesn’t allow the billing to be updated somehow by your backend team and are trying to make me jump through 100 hoops just to get back to where I was.","Transactions, Subscription, Quality, Customer Service"

"This is a great app with some unfortunate flaws. First, I love that they’ve added the mileage feature. I had to have the self employed app as well just for the mileage tracking. However, it is not always accurate and doesn’t always auto track. It will also put a random address and if you try to change the address, it doesn’t correct the appropriate amount of miles. You have to delete and manually add it. Also, you have to put in the right amount of miles when manually adding; it doesn’t calculate from the starting and ending point. So, if you don’t know the mileage off the top of your head, you have to go to another map and find out the distance. 
Second, I don’t recommend using the bank transfer feature. They hold the check for at least 4-5 days before releasing to your back so you’re looking at 7 days before the money shows up in your account.","App, Mileage Tracking"

Come on software developer team, give us the update too. This would make running my business fantastically smooth.",Quality

"The TV adverts enticing new customers make it look so simple; just snap receipts etc., quickly complete your accounts with the click of a button. 
The reality is that this is a complicated accounting product, and unless you have a really good grounding in accountancy you won’t have a clue what to do, or how to do it. 
Watch out HMRC. In the small business market, instead of making things more accurate I suspect this will be a case of “rubbish in, rubbish out”.",Quality

"QuickBooks online worked well for a few months but then suddenly our estimates and invoices don’t print out the service dates or captured signatures anymore. After customer support was not able to resolve the issue we get a call a week later from their technical department saying that they found a corruption in the database and asking for over $2,000 to fix it. We were given an excuse that sudden loss of connection could be the cause of the corruption. Needless to say we are going to be moving all of our transactions to another product. Sorry but you cannot run an online cloud product where the customer has no control over the database and have a mobile version where the customer has no control over the connection, and then blame the customer for corrupted databases and ask for a ridiculous amount of money just to fix it. Worst customer service and I will never recommend QuickBooks or ever use it again.","Estimates, Invoicing, Customer Service, Transactions, Quality"

"iOS 13 update: now you can’t even create a customer without soft-locking the app, awesome!

Tldr; Tracking work and getting paid are either impossible or broken via the app, but are functional in the online app, mostly.

There are major features lacking in the app: you cannot add delayed charges from the app, invoices generated on the web are present but not *visible* in the app!

Your customer asks you ""what do I owe you"" and you pull up your fancy app to show him only to get an error that the invoice was created on the web so you then waste time to dig it out of your email, all the while feeling like a fool for agreeing to a perpetual subscription for incomplete functionality.

This is your life with QuickBooks Online. 

Accepting payments via app is a chore: to simply select your customer (which you must do for each payment) entails several annoying steps:

1. Load payment screen (two taps)
2. Tap ""select customer"" (no in-line search!)
3. Tap search *button* to reveal search bar 
4. Tap search *bar* to bring up keyboard
5. Tap the customer

How could this critical workflow be so poorly executed?

Receiving payment is the actual purpose of QB right? 

Since most businesses have more than a screen-full of customers it might be a sane default to just start a customer search as soon as a payment is selected, saving 5 taps. At least focus the keyboard to start searching when you tap the search icon, saving 3 taps.

Speaking of getting paid, though not directly  related to the app: QuickBooks payments is a broken product, you send an invoice with a balance forward and your customer has no option to pay balance forward, so you're stuck explaining to customers that the bill they just paid is not the *entire* bill, awesome.","Updates, Quality, App, Invoicing, Customer, Subscription"

Quick question what about quick magazine?,
The developer is very slow to fix bugs and non responsive when a complaint or ticket is generated.

"I have been a QB online user for a number of years. However using the app on my iPad, I find it extremely frustrating as it appears they put very little effort into the app versus the online desktop version. If you think about it, what are the two most basic things you need to do in QuickBooks? Seeing what invoices are due to you from customers and what invoices you owe vendors. Both of these you cannot do in the QB online app. When I called, they asked for my account number and you cannot even find that in the app. Ultimately they advised me to not use the app and to login through Safari.","Transactions, Quality, Dashboard, Invoicing, App"

"The developer suggested reinstalling the app and updating iOS. No effect. Only today’s date in recorded for deposits no matter what date is selected. It’s been like this for months. 

Also, the developer stated that data can be backed up in Windows 10 by using the outdated Internet Explorer. You can’t. Windows 10 won’t allow the installation of the Active X control that QuickBooks requires during the backup process. In their own forums they admit that you need to use a Windows 7 (or XP) computer. Luckily I have one. If you don’t then you can forget about ever backing up your data.","App, Updates"

"Update:  developer says “. When it comes to recording discounts in the mobile app, we've got you covered. If you add a discount to your invoice and then select the tax rate, QuickBooks will automatically apply the sales tax after the discount. However, if you tap the discount again, there should now be a ""Sales Tax Before Discount"" box. Simply check or uncheck that box to get your taxes to apply properly. “ this is NOT how the mobile app works.  There is no option to change the order of the discount.  Maybe this is related to the bug in sales tax on the mobile app (as in its wrong and can’t be changed, another material problem with the app).  Terrible.

I have to login to the desktop version to print a credit memo. Further more, if an employee did he would have access to company banking, personal info, etc. That’s not acceptable. Secondly, screen becomes blurred fairly often for all three of us on each of our phones. All functions of the app are locked up when this happens.

"I use QuickBooks online and it’s fine.  Could be so much better, but it works.  I run an apparel manufacturing business downtown.  I’ve been collecting payments from the same clients through QBO merchant processing for years.  I’ve had a really tough 2 weeks getting through big productions and I was so excited when I got to the end and was able to bill all my clients.  My total came to $12k all collected through QB merchant services on 6/21/19.  It was a little bit more at once than usual.   But I was shocked when the money wasn’t being processed by Monday.  Tuesday I called in and after waiting on hold for 1 hour, i was told that my limit that I can collect is $5k!   What they don’t want small companies to grow??????  I’ve had to follow up calling them and waiting on hold for an hour twice a day everyday this week.  Every day getting more and more scared to not have that money!  I was begging QuickBooks to return my payments to my clients so they can pay me with different methods.  They were holding my money hostage while some unknown team spent an entire week deciding that I’m a high risk and they won’t accept those batches of payments they already collected!

Now it’s Friday.  I have over 6 shops and 20 workers that won’t be paid because QB merchant processing couldn’t process or refund my money before 8 days.  It will now take longer for the rejected payments to be returned.  It’s hard running a small business and QuickBooks just squashed one.

Lastly, I bought two different card readers to try out gopayment and neither of them  ever work.  So I just use square for my cc payments because it always works and they also seem to go to bat for me when a client tries to refute a charge.

Since the last update you cannot run credit cards on the app. It crashes immediately when you attempt to. My business uses QB on 25 devices. All crash when taking payments. This has caused a massive issue for us and clients. Beware of putting too many eggs in the basket of a company that can be sloppy with the interface they sell you.,"Updates, Quality"
I used to love this app. The last couple of months the app crashes daily and multiple times. I’m in the middle of working and the app says critical updates are needed and logs me out. I’m extremely frustrated with this considering I pay over $20/month to use this software across all my devices. No resolution or contact from customer service. It happens almost weekly. What a nightmare. Looking for alternatives.,"App, Customer Service, Experience"
"QuickBooks is one of the best accounting tools out there...

However this app is very limited.

iPad is a very powerful device. But this app doesn't take advantage of that. Things like: 
* auto save invoices to the files app
* option to choose payment type
* when you paste an email from the email apps, it doesn't recognize those emails..
* Option to add company stamp and seal to the invoices","App, Invoicing"
"Have identified at least these so far:

1 - automatically snap the photo once the borders of the receipt have been delineated by the software (like every other app of its kind since forever). Or create a toggle for auto/ manual (see app recommendation below).

2 - in Crop mode make the borders themselves draggable, not just the corners (makes it easier to maintain perspective/ prevent warping; see app recommendation below).

3 - add automatic image enhancement you can undo (broken record, see below).

Put devs with ownership of this feature onto looking at the dozen well-executed receipt scan apps out there, and emulate. In my humble opinion Scannable by Evernote has the strongest UX/ best productivity, though it is not accounting-specific. Suggest emulating this minimalist approach (which you are already doing): all the number crunching happens elsewhere within the Quickbooks app already. Scanner is a pure scanner and that’s it, not an expense categorizer, note taker, etc. Focus, make it the best scanner it can be with no muddying of that mission. Could consider an integration with Evernote/ licensing (“Powered by Evernote”). I am sure millions of users are using both to handle their business paper. Cross-promote, form strategic alliance.

Hope this helps. Will update this review upon implementation.","Receipt Capture, Quality, Expenses"

"This used to be a superb IPhone app. Then Quickbooks removed the functionality for accountants to inspect their clients’ profit and loss accounts and balance sheets within the app. The IPhone app developed other errors included restricted functionality when switching between our clients within the app. 
Here is what happened earlier this year when I complained about Quickbooks in a public space such as here in the AppStore, or on Trustpilot. Firstly Quickbooks tried to kill the problem with kindness writing to me publicly to make it look like they were addressing the problem. Secondly they then emailed privately, but deployed their non-English speaking staff who failed to understand the problem. Thirdly when they eventually realised the seriousness of the problem they deployed the correct people who then promised to rectify the problem within a series of timescales, all of which were extended time after time. Eventually the problem remained unaddressed and the specialist staff became uncontactable probably through embarrassment at their various failures to solve the issues. I have email after email after email after email proving all this, promising that these serious problems would be rectified. My conclusion remains the Quickbooks iPhone App is potentially a great product, but if you are a Chartered Accountant currently wanting to use this app to help your clients, FORGET IT. Look at Sage or Xero.","App, Quality, Experience"

"Apple has Quickbooks featured in a “Streamline Your Business” section. Laughable. 

Quickbooks is a nightmare of interface, usability, and pricing. Yet the accountant lock-in assures its continued existence. 

Take pricing, for example. With the desktop versions, one can have multiple companies, something many small businesses do for legal reasons. Quickbooks online? Forget it. You’ll need an actual separate subscription for EACH COMPANY! Truly ridiculous. Why not just enable multi-company support for companies registered to the same email?

This is just one tiny example of the lack of attention to design and price gouging of which Intuit is famous. 

Fortunately, there are more and more viable alternatives. Use the Google, Luke. 

Tell your account that they are just going to have to deal with whatever accounting software you choose. If they are a Quickbooks only shop, find another accountant.","Experience, Subscription, Customer Service, Quality"

I already pay a monthly usage fee, and then on top of that I pay transaction fees so for anymore fees, it's ridiculous. I stopped allowing customers to pay with credit cards because it was taking so much of my money from the fees. Being a very small business, I need as much of my money as possible so the fees add up quick. If there was another service out there that didn't take as much as they do, I would switch.

When it’s working it’s working great. I’ve tried a couple different systems and QuickBooks is by far the best with invoicing and estimates and excepting payments which is why the rating goes as high as four stars but it often crashes because I think it tries to do too much. Also there is no way to change when the system starts counting days past due. You can set it for net 15 net 30 or whatever but it will start counting from when you create the invoice not when you send it. For me I create an invoice on Monday and continue to add through it throughout the week and I send it on Friday so by that point it already says it is past due five days so I have to set it as net 15 just to not make it scream at me,"Estimates, Quality, Invoicing"

"Sincerely I start using this program because my bookkeeper recommends it. But after synchronize my bank accounts with QB and trying to reconcile my accounts the program gets really confusing and complicated to use. Actually, I email my bookkeeper and he answers me: ”There is certainly a learning curve with QuickBooks and it does take some time to get used to” if my bookkeeper told me that, and he is the one who knows how to use it, what can I expect if I want to use to program to ”do easy” my job. To learn how to use it you will need much time, and I don't have it. 
I look for videos to learn how to use it on YouTube and on QB and even those are confusing. 
Even do invoicing need time to learn. In the end, my Bookkeeper says you can use FreshBooks for invoicing and QB for the rest. So why pay twice?","App, Transactions"

"I have been using quickbooks since the late 90's and loved the program. Then in the last two years their ""improvements"" have led to massive data loss, in transferring from working on a cd to their special online version. I had to spend three months sorting over the data list in the synchronisation of my accounts. They then had the rate at $60 which was fair. The final gob stopper was when they said if you have more than 250 accounts you must now pay $150 a month. I have 580 accounts. This is outrageous and daylight robbery. I am not sure how many more people are going to switch from quickbooks to sage or peach tree but this is their death warrant to treat long standing customers like this. On top of it, you cannot edit accounts online with an iPad but only on a computer. For a small business that is a cruel and heartless joke to a loyal customer.",App

"STILL A ONE STAR.  Years later - update, after update, after update and still can’t use this in a multi-user environment.  Locations and Classes. How many effing times do I have to ask to get this fixed?

So in April Intuit ""reaches out"" that a fix is on the way.  That was 5 months ago!  I stand behind my criticism.

Still a 1 star.  What is wrong with Intuit programmers?

Yup, yet again another update, and still not useable in multi-user.  My business has more than 1 user account.  Locations and Classes do not work in their accounts.  How many years will this take to fix a bug that has been present since day 1?

Double entries, and deposits from their own QuickBooks Payments service don’t get matched up. Tax time is now going to be a pain because of all the errors their auto bank feed import created. Sadly, phone support was of little help, and wouldn’t even admit that they need to do better QA on data feeds from popular banks (mine is one of the biggest in the US- if it can’t get this right there’s no hope for folks using regional banks).

"This review is not about QuickBook's design regarding the recording and posting of entries. QuickBook's is deserving of this one-star review because of the terrible experience I had today with their customer service and subscription processing that snowballed into a 2-hour ordeal. I want to preface by saying I had the pleasure of meeting a few lead UX designers for TurboTax so I was actually biased FOR QuickBooks prior to this.

My free trial expires in two days and I had planned the whole time to pay, I just procrastinated on doing so. Today, however, I attempted to log-on and was greeted with a ""trial has expired"" message. 1) this happened 2 days before my trial period ended 2) I couldn't LOG IN TO PAY because my trial expired. I later discovered this was because I initially set-up the account on iOS, but there was no message to indicate this to me at the time, and I was forced to wallow in my frustrations. 

After repeated attempts to log in I was able to get into my QB online account when I accessed the site through my history.(not sure how that worked but that’s not the point here.) I finally get in and hit the “subscribe now” button and enter my payment information. I get a “something’s wrong, please re-enter your payment information.” So I do so. And I do it again. Still nothing. I switch to my credit card. Still nada. I then tried to go into settings and access the subscription tab but it wasn’t there, which after some googling I discovered was probably because I opened the account on the iOS app. Figured this was also why it wasn’t accepting my payment information.

ALL of this trouble just to PAY for the service. But don’t worry, it didn’t end there. 

So my iTunes account is attached to my family payment method, which I don’t want paying for QuickBooks. I would like to pay for my accounting app with my business account—makes sense right? Well, you HAVE to pay through iTunes if you open your account on iOS. So I get support on the line and “message an agent,” meticulously explaining my issue. We go back and forth and he tells me that I have to contact iTunes if I’m having trouble changing my payment method(not what the problem was). From the message you can tell he really doesn’t understand at all what I’m saying, and he was frustrated by that and was rude because of it. I tell him that I would not like to change my iTunes payment, that I’m trying not to pay through iTunes because I want to use my business account. He leaves me on read. Wonderful. So instead I ask support for a callback.

A very kind lady takes my case and after spending quite a bit of time trying to figure out what to do she’s about to walk me through what she thinks is a solution when my WiFi goes out, so I told her I’d have to call back. And that’s where I am now. Point: I spent nearly 2 hours trying to just PAY for a subscription. Absolutely ridiculous.

1)Trial ended early
2)Couldn’t log into account to pay
2.5)Didn’t tell me to try my iOS app
3)Just let me mindlessly enter my payment information without telling me that it was never going to work because I have to pay through iTunes 
4)Nobody at QuickBooks thought that a business owner wouldn’t want to pay through their iTunes account?
5)Disappearing subscription tab without an explanation other than in the forums
6)A rude, confused, and unhelpful customer service agent","Customer Service, Performance, Subscription, Quality, Transactions"

"Intuit has an app called SelfEmployed which is $4.99/mo and has more functionality than this one. It’s mind boggling. I can’t use that one because I need a Chart of Accounts so I got this one thinking. ’Same company so this app will have that functionality and more because its 10x more expensive.’

Wrong.

Here’s what I wish someone has told me: You can’t even manage an AmEx account on this app. As all my expenses go on my AMEX Business card, this app is literally useless. It shows you the balance. That’s IT. You have to do manage the expenses on a desktop computer. You CAN manage your AmEx expenses in Self Employed. Makes no sense.

You like the email receipt match-up functionality in Self Employed? Pretty nifty, right? Well you can’t do it in this app either.

This company is the absolute worst. It has — for two years in a row — told customers the online banking feature was going to be shut off on the desktop version forcing you to pay for upgrades. The $200 upgrade lasted a year before they told you that version was ALSO going to have the online banking functionality turned off.

To make matters worse, without notice, QB Online has introduced QB Advanced Subscription — a more expensive product.  In doing so, it has limited the number of accounts and classes permitted in QB Premium, meaning that our Company, which has more than 50 classes and more than 250 accounts, will no longer be able to use our current subscription and will be FORCED to upgrade to an expensive QB Advanced.  

And, as if that’s not bad enough, I discovered this by going to my Company Settings, where I saw a notice that this forced upgrade would occur in exactly ONE MONTH.  So, without receiving any notice, and out of pure luck, I stumbled upon the fact that they are holding my data hostage. 

AND, Intuit doesn’t want you to use desktop anymore because they can get more money out of your subscription than they can from the one time sale of desktop software. The result?  They have created ways to upload your data, but not to easy download the data. In fact, you have to go through MANY hoops to download your comprehensive data, during which you are bound to lose information. 

Time to look at other accounting software by companies who actually care about their customers.","Estimates, Customer Service, Subscription"

"I have used QB online for many years, and I’m very happy with it. The app is useless to me though, since the interface is way too limited. For example, one good use for it would be to enter receipts on the fly, but much to my disappointment I couldn’t do something as simple as to pull up a list of accounts to assign the cost to. Entering receipts would be a perfect use for a mobile app, but I simply can’t do it correctly. I mean, what did Intuit really think it was going to be used for?

Also, the payment methods I have set up in QB online are not available in the app, all you see is credit, check or cash. It seems like the app doesn’t synch fully with your online info, which makes you wonder what kind of mess it can create in your bookkeeping. Strangely enough, when I started the app it said that it was synching with my data, but it appears that this was just the basic data and none of my personal account settings.

It’s entirely possible that I have missed some of the finer details, but they really messed up the app by making the interface so different from the computer based online version. Having to learn and keep up with two versions is just too cumbersome for a small business owner like me, so this app is now deleted. Calling it a bookkeeping app is grossly misleading, since it’s so limited.","Quality, Customer, Experience, App"

"I am a young entrepreneur who has a background in Mechanical Engineer with a focus on manufacturing and product development. So when I decided to strike out on my own it was along these lines. I have tried several other software packages and they never seemed to fit the needs of my young dynamic company. Obviously what kept me from going QB right off the bat was cost. However, the integration with numerous other platforms and companies always was appealing to me. Then when my accountant made the suggestion to switch to QB she had a very good point. QB is about the only reliable and cost effective software that would handle the more complex project and multi-level customer account strategy that was necessary for me to implement. So I switched. I am happy overall. There are minor details that are infuriating, but for the broad spectrum of technicalities that I face this software blows all others out of the water.

"I’ve used QuickBooks since the late 1990’s and was an early adopter of QuickBooks Online. While Intuit has improved the platform dramatically, the latest rounds of “improvements” that have made the mobile app entirely unstable and unusable combined with nearly doubling the price and a pricing model that is disconnected from business scale (one could pay the same for a small business with $50k in revenue and a not so small biz with $10m in revenue) has left me utterly disappointed and looking for alternatives. Problem is, switching is nearly impossible. So, if you’re considering QuickBooks, just don’t. Try Xero or any other other competitors out there. If Intuit can fix its most basic issues and start providing actual customer support that is accessible (just try the “app help” link which takes you to an Intuit help page with NO APP SUPPORT option!) with modern methods (like chat and email instead of only phone, and phone that can’t be reached most of the time - again, give it a try), then I’d recommend QuickBooks again.

They say they try to make it easier to login by giving you only one password across all their products. But, these passwords are email specific, and if you have more than one Intuit account, it does not let you use an email specific password. So, you are prompted (no, you are ordered to) change password, and now the passwords do not match up because the other email addresses have different passwords.

There is no support for this product, none whatsoever. If you have a question and go to HELP, you will ultimately end up at the user group or user community. And, then there generally is no consensus on the solution. Every one is adrift on their own.

Ability to raise Purchase Orders to suppliers in the app: with ability to turn this feature on or off in app.

Link / Allocate Supplier Orders (purchases) to Sales back orders.

Flow Chart from Sales Po - Purchasing of stock against Sales Inv or Sales PO - and linking of Purchased shipments’ tracking info.

It would be good to be able to pull up the relationships between items clients orders of both sales and purchase and actual shipping info via tracking number and APi to view the flow of supply against sales orders etc. SAP has this ability (minus some of the features mentioned)

Allocating ordered stock (purchased) against Sales Orders to have a clear indication on how much of the ordered stock is pre-allocates and how much is extra stock for shelf.

Link with shipping programs by entering dimensions and weight and to book from with in or through APi.

I recently switched to a new business line but did not update the new phone # in QuickBooks online.  Now, I cannot login in online, I have tried but it wants to send a code to my old business line, which no longer exists... I called and spent an hour with quickbooks online and they couldn’t figure out how to reset my number; I am still unable to access the software online ( ironic, since it’s called “ quickbooks online”). The problem with this is that the iPad/ mobile platform software comes with many limitations, so the only was you can perform certain tasks is to login online.  

Next in line is the send invoice button.  You build your invoice, then send it by pressing the send invoice button; unfortunately the invoice does not always send and when it does, on occasion, it does not update properly in the mobile software.  I run my numbers tight and by the book and it’s extremely frustrating when you send off an invoice, it says it was sent, and the receiver actually never receives it. The solution is: A follow up call to every billed client to make sure they have received their invoice.

There is much more disappointment, but just not worth any more of my time to continue going on and on..

Conclusion: Find an online invoicing platform such as invoice 2go or something else other than this train wreck.  The amount of frustration and time consumption for such an inferior product at a premium price has no justification for an online/ mobile platform.","App, Quality, Invoicing, Experience"

The software itself I rate at 5/5 as well as the tech support whenever I have needed it. I have used quickbooks for years now.  I was however disappointed when quickbooks offered an incentive to recommend them to a friend but then did not follow thru with the offers once people signed up.

The running balance column does not show up in the app, safari, nor chrome. I tried to use another “desktop” browser and QuickBooks will not allow the use of other browsers on iPad. This forces the use of a desktop computer to see what your cash position is going to be next week or at the end of the month. I called support and they had no idea about how to support an iPad. Frustrating considering I spend over $500/Year between a couple companies.","App, Customer Service"

"I’ve been using QB since 2005 and wanted to really like this app but it has too many bugs.  Using the app in the current form will lead to frustration and look forward to spending many hours on hold with Tech Support.

The online version works best from a desktop.

On an iPad or IPhone, the app has problems paying vendor bills or in obtaining bank data.  These problems also exist when using browsers like Chrome, Safari and Firefox.  

Not sure how widespread the banking problem is but by chance I was in a Starbucks trying to sync bank data using a iPhone and IPad and I gave up and as I was preparing to leave, I notice another person at the next table with the online version of QB open on her laptop.  I asked if she was having issues. She was also have bank synchronization problems with her bank which was a different bank than mine.  We were both on the phone with tech support at the same time for the same issue.  Tech Support believes it’s a bank problem but the bank says it’s not them.

"I never write reviews but this has bugged me. So I’d heard of QB once before and have seen them advertised as being useful for business owners and the self employed. I decided yesterday to download and give it ago. You’re greeted with a 30 day free trial and then once proceeding and setting up your account you are immediately pressured into buying a “40% discounted” subscription of £5.99 or face paying £9.99 per month forever. So I agreed to it assuming it would be a useful tool and that naturally like any other subscription company the charging period would begin following the 30 day free trial giving you breathing space to cancel if it wasn’t fit for purpose. Well this is not the case. As soon as you commit to the subscription it begins charging you and waived and free trial period! Sneaky and underhand move there.

Also - when actually trying the software I tried to add an invoice to my account that I had sent a client recently. It wouldn’t let me add any additional lines onto the invoice which meant I could only add one cost and notes section completely missing the point of being able to break down various different costs on the one same invoice, such as expenses/sales etc. How stupid. 

On top of this the advertising didn’t make it clear there are two separate apps (business and self employed) so after downloading the QuickBooks app and going through the above it turns out that one is just for Business use not Self Emp. Please amend the app title in the App Store.

I’ve got a refund from Apple for the above but this shouldn’t have to happen. Please leave your underhand tactics at the door and play it fair like any other subscription service.","Quality, Subscription, Customer Service, Invoicing, Expenses"

"We’ve had a great experience using QB online as our main accounting and invoicing software.

It would be nice if inventory management and point-of-sale functionality weren’t so ridiculously expensive to add to the basic package.

I can track inventory manually with excel so it’s not like it’s some sort of fancy software coding to integrate point of sale and inventory management into the existing suite.

Current functionality is good, but if QB was to add those two items without charging and arm and a leg extra, it would be a GREAT value as a small business retail solution.

Even though it isn’t perfect, it’s much better than other options we’ve tried.

At the time of writing this review I have been on the phone with support for over 3hrs. Quickbooks online has been nothing but a complete disaster! For years I ran QB 2012 for Mac and was fairly happy with the software until it started crashing on me in mid 2017. Since it was time to update to a newer version of quickbooks I was pushed toward the online version since the latest desktop version for Mac was 2016. I had nothing but aggravation with the online version on almost every aspect of the software but if I were to explain each one this would be a book so I’ll just explain the problem that was most expensive to me. The syncing between the business checking and credit card on QBO would not sync for sometimes a couple days other times a month. When the sync feature would work it would create duplicate transactions and I would need to have QBO audited by my accountant to match my actual accounts.

After making several calls to QuickBooks they finally told me that the funds were put on hold because of possible fraud and requested I send them in with the mask of documentation regarding the service and items performed and sold, were the items came from purchase price customer payment receipts hello cremation that I didn’t feel need to be disclosed. Even though the customers payments had cleared their account QuickBooks held the funds for over 90 days, collected the interest and gave me the runaround with a list of things to do in order to have them to release the payments and deposit them into my account. Quickbooks only release the funds after I threatened to go public and blast them on social media. I would not recommend you choose to receive payments online through QuickBooks.

DO NOT use QuickBooks ACH payments by sending your customer invoices.  They only use STRIPE Via QB on your bank statements and then customers can dispute it as it does not say your business name and they will take the money within 2 days yet it take a week for it to ever been deposited when they take a payment from the customer. They will then charge you $10.00 per transaction as a charge back.  I have used QuickBooks for 19 years and have switched to another accounting software because of them being unprofessional.  Was on the phone with them last week for an hour and twenty minutes.  On the phone with them again today which currently at one hour and forty five minutes as I am typing this.,"Invoicing, Subscription"

Be that as it may, I must let them (and you, dear reader) know that the iPad version is a HUGE frustration. In most regards the 12” iPad Pro that I use is the best. Most advanced technology I’ve ever been pleased to use. However, tech laggards like Intuit make it a trial. Anybody know how to cut a check from the iPad version? PLEASE tell me! Yeah. I didn’t think so.

On quite a few occasions including the last six or seven attempts ‘unable to get all my QuickBooks data’ think I’ll be binning this app!,App
"As many others have mentioned before, this app suffers from serious lack of usability when it comes to backup and restore.  

Let’s start with some basics.  The software itself is great.  I very much enjoy it.  But beware, they want to monopolize the subscription market so their online software DOES NOT work with their desktop software.  So you’re either paying monthly FOREVER or not able to make out an invoice or expense on mobile. 

BEWARE OF HOW YOU PAY FOR YOUR SUBSCRIPTION!!!!  

If you subscribe through a third party like Apple, you can never stop.

My subscription expired and i clicked on the “renew” link that popped up in the app.  When i did so, it took me to a renewal page where i put in my cc info and added payroll.  Turns out, instead of renewing my existing company, they started a new one for me and were unable to transfer the payment info over because the existing company was LOCKED into third party payment processing.   

This started the process of having to backup my data and import it into the new company that had payroll attached.  As mentioned before, you have to export your data using an archaic system in IE.  Then most importantly, YOU CANT EVEN IMPORT THE SAME FILE THAT QBO EXPORTED AND USED TO BACKUP YOUR DATA IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!  It forces you to download Quickbooks desktop and import the file there and then export it from desktop to QBO.  You can’t even download Quickbooks desktop for free.  The trial link DOESNT WORK.  So, in my example, i am currently stuck with a third party payment processor whose payment info i can’t change (in other words i can’t separate my personal and corporate business expenses on a recurring monthly basis) and a system that i can’t transfer over.

It’s such a great tool,
App continues to be problematic at best. The constant need to log in every time I open the app is a huge PIA. App logs me out at any given time even when working in an invoice. After app automatically logs me out when I go to log back in it gives me this stupid error that says “oops something went wrong” I then need to go through the whole process of logging back in and waiting for my company data to load. Sometimes the app doesn’t respond to my log in and I need to dump the app and start over. At $12.99 I can say to myself it doesn’t cost much but at $34.99 I don’t feel as if I’m getting my money’s worth. I also know that writing this review is a huge waste of my time much like the app. Nobody reads these or follows up by contacting me. If I ran my business in this manner I’d have no customers. Intuit knows that once your company info is in their cloud it’s hard to switch over to another app without losing some of your data.

"Beware... Intuit has made it almost impossible to back up your data. To back up on a windows machine (backup isn’t possible with the app), you have to install internet explorer, which is now an outdated browser. Then you have to DISABLE ALL SECURITY on the browser and install an Active X control. Then you have to sign into QBO using this insecure browser and request a download. The first time I did this it took hours to get it to work right. The download kept going into a “virtual directory” that couldn’t be accessed. I eventually learned that this is how windows protects you from sites that don’t have up to date security (ahem... Intuit). This can only be “fixed” by disabling all security protections on the browser. So much for the “bank level security” that intuit promises. And each time I do a backup I have to reinstall the active x control through a laborious process involving completely uninstalling the QBO program.

Since QBO has a near monopoly in accounting they really have no incentive to make their products work properly.

My BIGGEST issue that I have been requesting on all QuickBooks online apps for a while now is the feature the billings App used to have for FREE. 

A simple list of all the clients emails for that particular company in a list with a check box next to each. We can select our repeats to automatically select those to include in estimates and invoices. But we can easily click to add others or remove them and have a note next to the names.

It helps so much to have all of those email addresses for each specific client to select from. Currently, we have to go in to the clients info page and add the email there or go and copy / paste it into my email. Both do not seem very organized were thought out for an app it's expensive considering the free app you took over had it before. Plenty of large companies just bringing freelancers or they have different people handling billing. We need a faster, simpler solution to select company email addresses foe each estimate/invoice.

So every time I send one to my customers I say QuickBooks writes a estimate and labels it as purchase order for some unknown reason. I continuously apologize for the problem inherently designed in by personal that don’t understand the difference from a purchase order and an estimated...

"This app is terrible. It is slow, has bugs, and it takes WAY too many steps to capture receipts and add them to a transaction - which should be the main selling point for this app. In fact, you can’t even add receipts to transactions that are “for review.” You have to add the transaction BEFORE attaching a receipt. Not at all useful when you want to attach a receipt do your CPA/bookkeeper can later weigh in on which account the transaction should go against.

My workaround is to add the transaction via computer, then go back in via iPhone to capture the receipt, but I get an error message if I do this right away...have to restart the app to get it to work!

"I have a LTD company on top of an employed job, so the company is just me and its small and I don't really need it to grow. My accountant recommended that I get quick books. It works well, does a good job of keeping track of income and expenditure and the invoicing of customers is very easy. Compared to my old system in which I kept track of accounts using MS Excel and then made a PDF invoice and emailed it to the customer, QuickBooks is excellent, very quick and efficient. I do wish though that I could turn off some features. For instance, there are different types of income and expense, and it suggests that I have different kinds of banking / company credit cards, different business accounts. Some of this is just confusing to me as it is labelled in technical jargon that I don't really understand, I wish I could just turn it off to being income, billable expenses and non billable expenses. The other problem I have is with the invoice numbers. If you forget to specify an invoice number it just defaults to the last one you made. That is maddening. I'd rather it just prompted me to fill the invoice number in.  You can customise invoices from a template and that works well, customers tell me that they look clean, crisp and professional and they are easy to pay. Expenses work well, you can create an expense item within an invoice and even attach a receipt or a phot o f a receipt to it, and then decide whether to include those attachments in the invoice sent to the customer. Finally, it talks to my business bank account and so it tallies items in QuickBooks with transactions in the bank, ensuring that both match and querying with you if they don't. In all I think its a really simple to use, great product that makes my small business finances a lot smoother than before, but I wish I could customise and simplify it a bit more.","Subscription, Customer, Invoicing, Estimates, Quality, Updates, Transactions, Experience, App"

"Quickbooks say it integrates with Paypal and automatically downloads transactions.

"I have been using QuickBooks for almost 8 years and QuickBooks Online for the last several. Having the option to invoice customers right from my phone helps a lot since sometimes customers will ask for additional services while I am at their house. If I would have used a preprinted invoice, I would need to edit it in the field. On the other hand, if I did hand written invoices I would have a mess of other paper work to do to keep track of all my income and expenses later in the year.
On the other hand, by bank made a change to the format of their login page around 3 weeks ago. They noted that it might take a week for financial software (like QB) to adjust to the changes. They were mostly right. For the next week I could not sync my data. But when it did come back, all of my records were backwards. QB could accurately read my bank balance for checking and savings, but every record I had ever made was applied to the opposite account. I gave it a few days, thinking other users would complain and the issue would be resolved. Didn't happen. I sent emails to my bank so their IT team could alert QB about the problem. I also sent messages to QB. They said they would look into it. That was a week ago and nothing has changed. I called into tech support and waited on hold for over 45 minutes before getting in touch with a person. He tried for over an hour to help me resolve the problem, but was not able. He said he would need to get together with his team and see if a solution could be found and that he would call me at 1:00 pm the next day. That was 2 1/2 days ago and the problem remains. 

A friend of mine is starting his own business while all of this is going on. Sadly, (for QB) I recommended Wave Accounting to him for his businesses. At least it's free.","Invoicing, Receipt Capture, Quality, Expenses"

I may have four or five stops in a day, and it makes my life much simpler to process all my receipts into QB before I ever leave.

Use it for a small business and overall it works great.  But... it seems like it will randomly decide to log me out when I just used it hours or minutes earlier.  Normally this is not a big deal but good security practice...  Like most security minded individuals I use a password app for storing hundreds of complex passwords that can be easily copied and then pasted into an app.  For some “brilliant” reason the QuickBooks developers have recently disabled the ability to paste a password during login.  I guess I’ll now change my long complex password to something I can easily remember making it less secure!  The ability to paste a secure password is good practice that all major vendors support - why is QuickBooks disabling it???,"Experience, App, Quality"

Second: I like to personalize my emails with the invoices; I have noticed that sometimes it accepts my changes and sometimes it does not.

This keeps things simple for me as Square is hardly ever any problem and I have workarounds with Quick Books when problems arise. Since QB handles no money for me they cannot hold my business hostage at any time. And since both programs have numerous reports this also  makes my tax requirements easy.

I can't see the whole screen on some of the webpages. Unless I go to a computer, which defeats the purpose of QB on-the-go, I don't know what is in the corners of the screen.

The bill to and ship to shown on invoices and estimates is mega-aggravating. It ends up the in right spot sometimes, at best. How can I present myself professionally when QB is making unfixable typos on my behalf?

If you enter a customer, then change what you entered at a later date, it's like a baby bird has imprinted on the wrong mom and it can't be changed. Again, professionalism is at risk. Baby bird follows you around indefinitely.

"Having been with Quickbooks for 10 years since my ex-accountant suckered me into it I've a few observations. 

1. Said accountant no longer uses it. 
2. Customer services are selective as to whether they respond and irritatingly unhelpful when they do
3. Multi-currency costs lots extra. If you are a small scale exporter go elsewhere for cheaper. 
4. If you want to get out? They make it close to impossible for you to take your accounts with you. This should be against the law but they can afford clever lawyers. 
5. UI is a joke. 
6. No sign of them offering auto-uploading to U.K. tax authorities as will have to happen by law soon. In obfuscating they'll keep suckers like me who can't leave but will lose business.

"I’ve been using QuickBooks online for over a year and while it’s ok, it’s really lacking in a lot of areas. 
Also, the mobile app can not perform a variety of common tasks that the computer app and web interface can do. 

For instance, I cannot edit certain invoices on mobile if they have expenses included. 
Once an expense is added to an invoice, only the desktop app or web interface can edit it. 

Also, as many have said, if you’re used to the traditional QuickBooks PC or Mac software which has been available for many years, the hosted version can be difficult to adjust to. 
It’s not capable of everything the older software can do, and a separate paid subscription is required for every company file you maintain. 

I am self employed with fairly simple invoicing needs, and I still have to use the most expensive subscription in order to simply link expenses to invoices.

The hosted services leave a lot to be desired, but they do have som me positives as well.

Intuit was & is cheaper per month than the other software, they converted my old data file over for free & all worked from day one. 
The book keeper actually works on the accounts 40% less (time to complete same tasks), saving our business lots of $. 
And I can input/complete invoices from all my devices! No matter what operating system they are using. 
We can’t recommend this software enough, 10 out of 10 Intuit (QuickBooks)",Invoicing
"Tldr; Tracking work and getting paid are either impossible or broken via the app, but are functional in the online app, mostly.

There are major features lacking in the app: you cannot add delayed charges from the app, invoices generated on the web are present but not *visible* in the app!

Your customer asks you ""what do I owe you"" and you pull up your fancy app to show him only to get an error that the invoice was created on the web so you then waste time to dig it out of your email, all the while feeling like a fool for agreeing to a perpetual subscription for incomplete functionality.

This is your life with QuickBooks Online. 

Accepting payments via app is a chore: to simply select your customer (which you must do for each payment) entails several annoying steps:

1. Load payment screen (two taps)
2. Tap ""select customer"" (no in-line search!)
3. Tap search *button* to reveal search bar 
4. Tap search *bar* to bring up keyboard
5. Tap the customer

How could this critical workflow be so poorly executed?

Receiving payment is the actual purpose of QB right? 

Since most businesses have more than a screen-full of customers it might be a sane default to just start a customer search as soon as a payment is selected, saving 5 taps. At least focus the keyboard to start searching when you tap the search icon, saving 3 taps.

Speaking of getting paid, though not directly  related to the app: QuickBooks payments is a broken product, you send an invoice with a balance forward and your customer has no option to pay balance forward, so you're stuck explaining to customers that the bill they just paid is not the *entire* bill, awesome.","Quality, App, Invoicing, Customer, Subscription"
"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. I ""upgraded"" from my QuickBooks 2009 Simple Start (which I loved) to a monthly subscription for the QuickBooks Online Simple Start version. For the last 2 weeks, I cannot sign on using the Windows App. It keeps telling me that the password is wrong. IT IS NOT! I KNOW MY PASSWORD! I went ahead and changed the password to attempt to gain access. Even after going through that process, it will go to the sign in and I enter the new password and it will still not let me in and it continues to tell me that it's the wrong password. Everything works fine on my iPhone and iPad Pro apps and the web browser version. I still need in to the Windows app version though. There are things that can be done there that cannot be done anywhere else. 

When you search for a tech support number online, I was given a toll free number (855-633-1777) that was answered by foreigners who look up my account and then tell me that they can certainly help me but the tech support is a pay service and I will need to pay them! WHAT? I DO PAY EVERY MONTH. YOU WANT ME TO NOW PAY YOU TO BE ABLE TO SIGN IN TO YOUR SYSTEM THAT IS NOT WORKING. THIS IS NOT AN ERROR ON MY END!! WHEN I REFUSED TO GIVE MY CREDIT CARD INFORMATION, HE REFUSED TO HELP ME AND LITERALLY CUSSED ME! 

I found another number for QuickBooks customer support (800-488-7330). It is RIDICULOUS the hoops you must jump through just to find a phone number for these goons that I am paying for a service that i cannot use because their app is messed up!!! The man that answered the phone this time was at least a US citizen that could understand my clear English and I did not have to repeat me email address 6 times and spell it three times like the first phone number. However, he was certainly a complete jerk with an arrogant attitude of, you need me, I don't need you! This guy was absolutely impossible to talk to. After a few minutes, he muted the phone on his end and pretended to hang up on me. I waited for about 4 minutes but he was NOT going to stop playing his games. I finally had no choice but to hang up because he clearly wasn't going to assist me. I tried calling back but now it was after hours and they were closed! This has not been the best 2 weeks with Intuit QuickBooks. I do not get aggravate easily and I NEVER write reviews. But I am very aggravated now and I will write reviews for days if it will help to keep someone else from going through this nightmare with this company that very clearly has no concern for it's paying customers.","Subscription, Quality, App, Customer Service"
"Very helpful in organizing expenses immediately post point of sale. However, the app is very slow to load and process commands throughout the process. It appears to be writing records to a server after each line entry instead of when completely finished entering an expense transaction. When you are in a rush, the last thing you want to do is wait for this sluggish app to process before heading to your next task. Makes you want to skip the hassle instead of being diligent in your expense tracking efforts.","App, Expenses, Estimates"

Definitely a few things we would like to add/edit a bit but this is a must have for any business!!!,
"I use this to send estimates that turn into invoices immediately with a few quick adjustments (my decisions - otherwise it's a simple one click). I have it automatically set to accept Credit cards, Bank Transfers, or they can send a check. Once you set it up the first time and make everything look how you like, it's automatically way easier to track everything and even send all transactions even via phone. I'm using my iPhone 6s to run my whole business now.",Quality
"As a small business owner we never have enough time. QB makes account quick and is very easy to understand. $15/ month (which is a tax write off) is a great deal. Think about what you'd have to pay a CPA to complete all of this paperwork. My accountant can easily sign in at the end of the year and get the necessary information. The customer service line is MORE than helpful. I've thought about going to QB training classes but there is no need to pay someone else to teach you about QB. With their helpful videos and attentive agents I've been able to learn and understand the program quickly. 
I've gotten 2 other business owners to use QB and will keep spreading the word!",Customer Service
Super,
I hate book keeping. More than anything in life. I have been forced to do booking keeping for reasons I won’t go into but I digress. I have quick book pro and self employeed.

I can access QuickBooks  with my phone or my computer and it saves me time and money",
"The app is OK when it works, which is less time than when it doesn't work. Intuit is nothing more than a bloated corporate bureaucracy that has a relatively captive audience, so it's unlikely they'll do anything to improve their products until people start leaving them en masse for alternatives like Sage or Xero.

Some of the ideas within the QBO app are good, but when your customer can't pay your invoice because the Intuit systems are ""temporarily unavailable"" all day long, you're going to have a cash flow problem.

Even aesthetically speaking, the app is cluttered and tries to pack too much into it (except for the stuff you really need to be there). I am an accountant and will stick with QuickBooks until my last client migrates to Xero or Sage, then I'm leaving too and won't look back.","App, Customer, Invoicing, Quality"

"Accounting manually with a ledger would be quicker than this program. I officially hate this program and will be changing to another accounting software in July. I have been using quickbooks since 2000 and used to love its simplicity but it has become time consuming and harder to use. Make a mistake...can't fix it. If you are away you can't access all the features using the app - you have to find a computer and log on. App is garbage and pay run screen won't scroll so you can't edit anything like hours worked, for example. Reckon looks like a really good alternative. Maybe quickbooks should have consulted keychain when they developed the app. If you thinking of quickbooks for your business...DON'T DO IT!

"I've used QuickBooks and it's nothing but a trap! I understand if you make a great product people will beat your door down wanting it however, in the case of quick books I think most people would like to see them beat down! They make you pay a monthly or yearly fee to use their product and god forbid you are even close to late because they lock you out of the accounts, slow the program down and just make it very difficult to use their product. It's almost as if they are so worried about their money they'd much rather see a business fail then working. In my opinion, QuickBooks is no better then any other money hungry book keeping app that is only in it for themselves and money and trust me from personal experience, they couldn't give a rats rip about you and your company! Customer no service is just that.. worthless!! This is just one business owners experience but I'd be very Leary !!!",App

"I have been using QuickBooks for almost 8 years and QuickBooks Online for the last several. Having the option to invoice customers right from my phone helps a lot since sometimes customers will ask for additional services while I am at their house.

Consistently new types of things – supposedly to help users – pop up on the screen but just cause delays and inefficiency.

"This software is clunky and difficult to use. The page that opens first on the app makes little sense. The terminology used in expenses does not apply in Australia and I have no idea what some of it means. The invoicing section is awkward to use. I tried another type of this software called ""self employed"" (another app by the same company) which seems better and easier to use but it also uses non Australian compliant wordings. I found a reason not to use that either. Why do they have two apps which are basically the same but slightly different? Hence more confusion. It would be better to streamline both and turn it into one app as both are meant for a self employed person anyway. Why does one have an auto logbook but the other one doesn't?","App, Customer Service"

"After a couple of years of bombarding to upgrade to online I gave in. No one explains how many features are locked down in the online version, until you migrate and start to use as a long time desktop user. 

The product itself has a lot cleaner interface. But the support for a business product is terrible. The people you speak to don't know the product, and have no means to escalate a knowledgeable person, any attempt to get a close out to a problem is impossible, they won't commit to when an issue will be fixed and once they escalate, you are in the dark. 

I want to manage my business, but since migrating to this product I feel I spend more time talking to intuit than my customers.

If someone would sit on a call and commit to close my issues, I would rate it highly as a product. But as a technical guy, clearing the browser cache is not the answer to every issue.

If your business relies on this product, I would seriously consider not bothering. I'm sure if missed our subscription then there would be some attention from the account team.

If you want to leap in the dark, then my advice is don't migrate your QB data and start afresh.","Experience, Customer Service, Quality, Customer"
"I have been using QB online since 2011 and can honestly say that it has delivered an exceptionally easy and effortless business accounting solution. One touch payroll and the ease of AP and AR management is awesome. I do all the accounting for my startup and I rely on QB to make it all possible. QB is continuously improving both the desktop and mobile apps to make my life easier.

"Such an easy app to use, These guys have simplified bookkeeping down from something I wouldn't dare touch, to being able to raise invoices from my phone and connect my bank accounts, no hassles at all.",Invoicing
QuickBooks has truly been a great help to starting our own business!  It's definitely user friendly!!  Highly recommend it!!,
Good to have access on any device. Does a great job but a little more customisation for service industry would be good. Overall very efficient bookkeeping solution.,

Awesome,
"The app works great, although lacks a few features like deleting certain transactions. QBO itself works great once you get it going, but it's not ready for prime time straight out of the box. It took me 6 weeks to get it tweaked with many many calls to support. I guess that's why you get unlimited free support, because you'll need it. The 4 star rating is because once you get it going, it works great, better than the desktop version, but I can't give it 5 stars.","App, Transactions, Customer Service"

"This is in addition to the comments I made a year ago: 
I now discover that any Suppliers' invoices added as Bills (not Expenses) via the online system are NOT visible when they are looked up within the App!!
This makes the use of the app a very second-rate experience, only useful for adding expenses. The so-called all singing and dancing online version is still clearly a Beta version!)
It would be very handy when I'm on the move, but is IN NO WAY a replacement for the desktop or on-line versions.
Also, be aware that if QB has been used for any work between the times you've last used the phone app, be aware it will spend some (considerable) time to update the app database on the phone - so have a STRONG wifi signal or you'll be waiting for ages!
The ability to scan/photo receipts is a useful feature - but again trying to add a scan of a paper invoice, logged as a Bill, is not possible directly - as Bills are not viewable !!!","Invoicing, Expenses, App"

Great app now i can do the books from anywhere,
"$600 a year... From your iPhone you can't access essential functions such as: 
Tracking inventory quantity on hand
Adding new inventory quantity
Adding new inventory to categories
(i.e. services or taxable goods)
Sales tax reports
Moving line items when creating invoices. 
The above features need to be accessed from your PC, which is slow and cumbersome.
If you have 2 ""bars"" or less of LTE, takes FOREVER or may not load and save transactions
If you are in a remote area with only 4G coverage, it's inoperative, defeating the ""mobile"" part of your business.
If your business deals with Taxable sales, wholesale, and non taxable service, and your jurisdiction requires reports for each, you will need to create a custom report, prepare to set time aside for that.
Customer Support lacks knowledge of basic business functions, if you can even get in contact with them.
I've been a user for 2.5 years, better than when it was first launched, but far from the price of $50 monthly for Plus($35 when you initially sign up).

"The only thing I like about the app is the ease of tracking expenses. Pretty much everything else is only accessible from a desktop or laptop computer.  Invoices are a major problem with this app.  Most of our clients don't use or don't have an email address to send invoices to. So I have to individually print each one. I would like to be able to batch print invoices, as this is how most clients prefer to be billed.  Not being able to access customer info offline is some what of a hassle, as most of the time when it needs to be accessed we are on the phone with the customer.

It simply gives you an erroneous number.  This means that the main screen that is supposed to give you all the vital information on your company is completely unreliable and useless.  It's like driving with a speedometer that is utterly unreliable and always wrong. Would you put up with that?  Well, welcome to quickbooks.

"No signature capture debacle

Update: #2 of  8-7-17
Well look at that the capture signature button is there now. Now either the button was not there and added now Or the button was there and customer service has no clue what there doing and how to use there own product. See notes below)
Im giving ***** right here but not changing my app store stars im sorry , the customer service was ridiculous and a waste of my time. Horrible. Wow so frustrating   Thank you for responding to my review here i appreciate it. Please for love of bookkeeping train those people geez. 

Update: 8-7-17
In your response to your most recent update. All the customer service calls noted below were for the mobile app. And your help center that i guided customer service to view is geared towards the mobile app. And those are the responses i received from them over the phone. 

Update : response to developer 8-5-17
Puzzled ? As am I 🙄 
I called in 4 times about this ability to capture signatures 
First time I called the customer service person tells me, no we dont have that no you cant. Then i asked why is it your help center data base clearly stating plain as day instructions on how to. 1. Create new invoice 2. Enter all needed information 3. Click on the CAPTURE SIGNATURE. 
Also not to mention the fact the screen shot here in apple app store for quickbooks clearly shows a signature being captured.  So after lots of back and forth tells me this is a new and quickbooks company doesn't tell them (customer service) what quickbooks os doing. What!? Got off the phone didn't want to waste anymore of my time. 

Round 2 call 
Customer service tells me that its not capable of capture signatures, then after guided her to your help center where it clearly states how to puts me on hold then comes back and says that its new and there and there implementing it in in phases !? and my account number is part of phase 3 and would add the capture signature button in 3 weeks. Ugh ok i guess i can understand that. 

Round 3 

Called in again 
She also tells me no its not possible
explained my last call with customer service and stated i was checking on the the update phase. After explaining the last call i had to this customer service rep. She was more bewildered than prob you are right now reading and she to was left puzzled as was I. Then proceeded to put me on hold to research. Comes back tells me yes you can but only if you have a merchant services account through you. Hmm thats odd i thought. She tells me that the signature capture is for payment credit card. So i proceeded to explaining a plain signature capture by a customer on an invoice. She proceeded to tell me no unless you have a merchant account. Ok fine over, but before i got off i guided her to the help area in quickbooks if you search HOW TO CAPTURE SIGNATURE. It clearly says so and what she told me didn't match with what was posted on the help area. Which is CAPTURE SIGNATURE---AVAILABLE ON INVOICES AND ESTIMATES. now if your estimate is being signed i didn't know you had to have a merchant account AND I didn't know thats industries standard to run a credit card transaction off of an ESTIMATE.  

In the end puzzled as you are and pretty much moving on to another service unless you can find someone that knows what exactly is going on over there at Quickbooks. That i will end up speaking too someone that knows what there doing and what there talking about, i will not call and waste more of my time . And by the way your web browser version of quickbooks online on a mobile device does not load correctly the right side is cut off making the invoices or anything you do on there useless Im on an iPad 12"" pro. Doesn't matter what browser you use same prob, try using the app instead but cant as it lacks all the features the browser version does. 
So any way you cut it. No signature capture something so simple to do. 

Please let me know what you think of all that, im trying to be helpful here as I expect better from quickbooks your industry

"There are many features still missing in this app to make it a complete accounting solution for any business. For example, there is no way to enter purchases of assets. Also, its not possible to enter a bill without paying it right away. What if your company does not pay its bills one by one but instead pays multiple at once. 

Many other features are lacking and this app cannot be used without its windows or web portal yet. I believe that Intuit has always suffered in making an application that is reliable. They should concentrate on fixing their current version of the software before trying to create new versions and different platform app before having one versions that is stable and does what its supposed to do. 

We are using Quickbooks because the company has been using it since the beginning and because it would be too much work to change all of our hundred thousands of items to a new solution.

But over the years we suffered from file corruptions, to quickbooks creating its own archiving transactions creating havocks in our entries that were archived and multiple tax audit because the software limits the way some entries happen. 

By the way, even if you don't have anything to hide, never give the government access to your Quickbook file, they will question every entry, even entries that were entered by mistakes and reversed later. They don't look for the reversed correction for the mistakes. 

Suffice to say, this app is not ready to do what the full version of the program does and is in no way a replacement for computer desktop in the accounting department, services department, parts (retail counter), or any that runs a company with at least one employee.

I don't know who that person is who says ""Now my computer usage is 99% iOS..."" but let me confirm that it's now because of this app.

Being able to utilize the app on mobile has made billing my customers so much easier for my transport company. Editing and immediately sending invoices for quick pay is a great option as well. I've been a QuickBooks user for 20 years now and will likely not stop anytime soon.,"Customer, Invoicing"
Easy once its set up and great for tracking business activity.,
Several bugs. Customers having trouble paying online. Was told to have them use a different browser. Really?  Drop down menus recently stopped working.,Quality
When it properly syncs with your bank account it works great.  Takes a file for QBO to help with syncing issues.,Quality
I use it every day to run my business.,
"It's good for entering payments, that's about it. And even that is a stretch because half the time it shows invoices are unpaid in the app while the desktop accurately shows the same invoices as paid.","Invoicing, Quality"
"Quickbook app is a great add to the software program. Easy to use, fast and well organize!",App
I could it be done by the same work without quickbooks! it has freed up my time and helped me keep track of projects. I am forever grateful!,
The app works great and is a very useful tool for on the go business matters. I have not yet figured out how to add single time activities on the app ... not sure this feature is available. But other then that it's great!,App
"This app is ok but it's been out for a while now and we still do not have pricing levels. It has been in the works according to QB for almost 2 years and we still don't have it plus I can't go back to desktop program because data will not import properly 

NEED SOMETHING DONE ASAP. YOU RAISED THE PRICE BUT CANT GIVE US WHAT WE NEED!!!!",App
Can't send statements or use bundles in the app. Email customer services about it and they send you a email about doing it on your desk top. Been asking for 6 months to have it added to the app. Just get the same response while they add useless gimmicks to the app.,App
I was a huge sceptic (I have been a pro advisor for several years)and very had a very negative opinion of QB online. That was until a couple of years ago when I attended a presentation of the capabilities of the software. I was sold on its usefulness and have been using and recommending it ever since.  QB online adds important features regularly. Buy it!!!  You won't be disappointed,
Allows me to manage everything on-the-go. Powerful software for small and medium size business.,App
Wish i could edit my estimate better.,Quality
"Used a different invoicing program for years but would not sync with quickbooks.

Love using it! Helps to have it for my small business :),
It is a great app. Wish it had full functionality. Payroll within the app. Not a extra app. That only works. If you want Ituit to handle everything. Need to work like accessing from desktop. Writing checks should also be there. Plus running reports. But it is a great app. With limited function. Has gotten better. Just wish it was getting there faster.,"App, Transactions"

Each revision makes the app even better. I did not appreciate the price increase but if the service continues to improve then it is valuable to my organization.,
"They don't even deserve single star very very poor support/customer care, basically they don't support in solving the customer problems/feedback but they put big big support pages mentioning we will get back to you in 1 day support , all of nonsense. No one will respond or when we call the customer support team then also nobody responses... but they take the fee in advance that too full payment....very very disappointed and frustrated with Quickbooks!!!!","Quality, Performance, Customer Service"
"I'm a contractor, not a ""business man"" by any stretch. But, the QB staff have helped me many times to navigate and learn. Kudos!",Experience
3 stars as you are unable to run payrol on the go or even view payroll - employees wages which is a major part of this app that is missing. Also when uploading attachments you can attached anything other than a photo. No links to Dropbox etc which again is a major flaw,App
I like the ease of use but there were still a few things that were not intuitive such as determining who a cheque was written to for the account.,
Excellent for the iPad love I can do invoicing on the go,Invoicing
"I use the mobile version and it's access to my phone contacts makes it really good. there have been a few minor glitches with support but this is getting better and better - so apart from the few minor glitches early on then it would be getting 5⭐️
Latest update after 6 months - excellent 5 ⭐️",
Easy to use although experienced problem with VAT rate not being editable in online desktop version. Intuit' response was really quick and efficient and friendly. Highly recommend.,
"We need barcode scanning capabilities, ASAP!",
"I've been waiting years for the ability to attach files to an invoice from a Cloud-based source and it's finally here in this release. Thank you!

Now my computer usage is 99% iOS, independent of a desktop.",Invoicing
"The interface is nice but it does not at all fit to the European context that requests to work with multiple currencies. Further, many standard functionalities, like adding attachments disappeared, replaced by adding a picture, what is not understandable.
Bank reconciliation has a time out, so that the button accept disappears as you try to think if all is correct. You end up having to resell the the position in order to accept it.

I am very disappointed by the software as it seems that the developers never worked on a proper accounting system before. It makes me loose too much time instead of gaining time.
the only reason I still use it is because my accountant uses it.","Experience, App, Quality"

Quickbooks has helped steamline our accounting and now we're really efficient 😀👍,
"I upgraded finally from the old desktop version and I love being able to write and send invoices on my iPad or phone on the go, and keep everything synced up. 

Admittedly, the cloud solution is designed to keep you paying, rather than plodding on with an old desktop version like I did for many years, and if you are on the basic version there may be a frustrating lack of one or two features that would just make life easier so you may end up upgrading, but for the convenience and intuitiveness of this app I think its worth it. 

I found some operations difficult to find, but with the customer support which is decent, I was able to find a way to get things done and it becomes natural after spending some time with it. 

Overall, there's a reasonable learning curve but it does what I end and is nice to use.","Invoicing, Quality, Customer Service"

"No signature capture

Update:   7-27-17

There is no signature capture on invoices even though they tell you there is there is not. It only applies through tak ing payment by credit card transaction through quickbooks. Something that is so basic to business the leading book keeping company can not provide. Walk into customers store drop product they sign the invoice received! Thats It! Nope not quickbooks so pass them up. Plus thats not counting time hours and hours of lousy customer service and back and forth till they finally fessed up to it.

"The instructions in the help section are out of date or just completely wrong. I can't set my cost of goods. QB makes my cost my sale price and there seems to be no way to fix that. So it creates a lot of extra work to reconcile sales and costs. It's BS considering this is an essential function of accounting. But of all the options QB is the cheapest, so I guess it's this or go somewhere else and pay more money to have an accounting program perform slightly more than basic functions.","Help, Quality, App"

"The interface is really cute. On my laptop, online has consistent data. I have used this for over 3 years and one thing that seems to be VERY consistent is the phone app is boo boo. It never pulled data accurately. Whenever I need to pull overdue invoices for a client, the app fails (it will not show them). I have to pull over and pull out my computer. That's stupid.

I own a business now, so I was hoping to have a different (more advanced) system to track my miles. Well, their mileage tracker is awful! So far, it's only recorded trips one way and not the way back. Sometimes doesn't even record a trip at all!

Update... Application remains impossible to use on both iOS and android devices. Invoice matching for banking transactions is painful particularly when there are many invoices to match to a single banking transaction and application seems to refresh in the background which causes matches to be lost before completing.

Great app,App
I like the apps easy access but it truly suck because nothing is accessable properly. Writing an estimate or invoice on this app is not possible. Not properly anyway. Its really not pleasant either going online via cellphone because it zooms in and out improperly. Its very frustrating. As for quickbooks via laptop i love it. Quickbooks has truly made my life much easier and way more organized. But the app needs to be fixed and also online via cellphone bugs.,"Estimates, App, Quality"
Won't let me sign in from phone (s10). App is useless unless used from computer,
"Couldn't run by business without Quickbooks Online. I love all the integrated features from processing invoices, payroll, and running company financials. I'm liking the new Projects feature to examine profit and loss per client per project. I love being a part of Priority Circle. Great value for the cost! I only use the app to review everything at a glance and maybe send invoices. However, it lacks some of the key features from the Online version.",Invoicing

So I receive the code by email and view it on my laptop (which takes 5 minutes to start up). 1st off it tells me I'm not connected the the inernet, which I was.

"This review covers the Quickbooks online solution as a whole. our company was using QB Pro desktop version for 10 years. We decided to go online since it was easier to connect and work online plus had several added features. Should have never switched from Desktop pro period. Here are the negatives: - Purchase orders, you cannot customize the PO form style to have several different views that gets sent. You get what you get from Intuit and that's it. you can create customer views for Estimates and invoices. - Products and services, cannot create your own custom field. Manufacture should be a standard field when buying products. in desktop at least we could add our own field. - Existing projects don't all convert to the new way of how they do Projects online. If you have more than 1 or 2 indented Jobs they wont convert. single level job entries would convert. - Payroll, not able to create new payroll items to manipulate paystubs. We do this for banking time in $$. - Payroll accrued vacation. only allows you to accumulate hours not $$. Totally useless. The negatives outweigh the positives, as of this date of review i would strongly recommend not switching to QB online. App is pretty useless as well cant see inventory of individual item, havent tried anything else on APP.","Subscription, Quality, Invoicing, Estimates, App"

Country like Bahrain and Kuwait currency has three decimal. Is there any option to set currency in three decimal? We submitted so many requests regarding this issue but no response. I think you note understand what i mention here . here in Bahrain currency Dinar and fils 1000 fils = 1 Bahrain Dinar .so some time the product price come with 0.755 or 1.995 something like .the lowest coin is 5 file means 0.005 . in your software the decimal 0.00 only hope you get my point Regards,"Quality, Customer"

"All I wanted was to do payroll and invoicing. This company has more than one app and Ive downloaded both of them and neither of them do payroll. So stupid. Why would the same company have two different apps for essentially the same thing. Completely confusing, been looking through their stuff for over 2 hours now. What a waste of time. By the way as a message to the company, you should delete this app entirely and move everything to the self employed app, its way more intuitive appealing.","Expenses, Subscription, App, Experience"

"Do not use this app! Logging in is a painful experience. Once you log in, it will ask you for a QuickBooks password, when you enter it, it will throw you back to the login screen. if you reset your QuickBooks password it will allow you in once.

Great small business financial management tool,
I like the app but it has some persistent issues. The most common one is not being able to edit invoices. Quite often I have to delete an invoice and start again or send it early and continue in a new invoice as I cant add new information to it. Tried logging out and back in and tried refreshing. Nothing works. The invoice is either at that point to be scrapped or has to be sent incomplete. Also the desktop version gives far more in terms of what you can do but I find it totally confusing.,"Quality, Invoicing"

"Overall I've been satisfied with this app. The convenience of having my business financial information with me at all times is valuable. However, while originally having rated this app 5 stars I've reduced the rating because of my frustration with Intuit to address two long standing issues. In spite of all that one can do from within the app bank deposits can't be recorded. The suggested fix is to log into the account on-line and do it that way. Really? If I have to log into the account on-line to perform this simple activity what's the point of using the app? Also, there is no way to manually mark a bank transaction as cleared. Again, really? Both of these seem like pretty simple functions, but notwithstanding the fact that they've had multiple requests Intuit seems to ignore them. Disappointing!","App, Transactions, Experience"

"Quickbooks on line is really the only workable online bookkeeping solution for small business.
It still needs a lot of work to make it worth what they charge for it.
Also be very careful when upgrading from one level to another. A very slick customer service rep had me upgrade to a level of service that cost twice what I was paying claiming that I would have a certain functionality that I needed.
In the end, not only did I not get what I needed, but I could not return to the basic level, unless I wanted to close out my account and loose all my data.
Still all this being said, as far as I can tell it is the best of what is being offered as a web based service.","Customer Service, Quality"
"Yup, yet again another update, and still not useable in multi-user.  My business has more than 1 user account.  Locations and Classes do not work in their accounts.  How many years will this take to fix a bug that has been present since day 1?

Another update and I stand behind my previous review(s).

Seriously? Another update, and still not multi-user friendly.  But, oh boy, something works with Apple Watch.  When will Intuit fix the multi-user issues?  Someone else mentions they fix bugs.  I can say the exact opposite - they leave bugs for years!

We love QBO.  I am away from the office about 80% of the time and I love the ability to review sales and work with the store manager and team from anywhere. The only drawback we have found is the limited edit capabilities the sales staff has. There should be more customization when granting access to users. The desktop version allows users who limited to sales the ability to edit their mistakes. QBO places that burden on the administrator.,Customer Service

"We have used various QB versions since 1999. The desktop versions were also difficult to startup, but eventually worked until we switched to the new and IMPROVED! Then we started over. The online version was to be an improvement we wished for due our service organization, and in the field invoicing. There were many glitches we tried to work around. Several issues we tried to work out with little success, we took to the Tech Service advisers.  Spelling out our primary problems and items we would like them to add. We were told that all our issues were valid and that they would keep a ticket open for us to see the progress, and that they would be in contact with us during the process. Well it died there. The ticket was closed later that same day, and we were never contacted. There advisers (in our experience) are quite useless.","Quality, Experience"

But you can access useless features that are just gimmicky: use your fingerprint to log in. View profit loss because that's where you do your deepest analysis, which frustrates even more because you can't alter anything.

Does the job.,
"I'm an IT Professional who does commercial & residential repairs, contracts, services and sales in person and on my eBay store (I'm self employed and do all this from home) and the quickbooks online version is way easier and faster to use than the traditional computer installed version. Also, I didn't have to cough up $400-$600 for the desktop version (heavy program & used way too much memory) that will eventually be outdated. The desktop version had more options within the software, but the online version is more versatile if your utilizing multiple devices to run your business. As for me, I have a dedicated eBay room with iMac the dedicated tech/repair room with Mac Pro server, the main office AKA my office with iMac and I work from my iPads when I'm in the family area (I have a bluetooth keyboard and treat the iPads as if they were mini-iMacs and I can take signatures while out on a job-site and add receipts and pictures to estimates and invoices or the note section for each customer. If you have a regular wifi ipad like me, now with most companies like Verizon, I can turn on the personal hotspot for free and turn my iphone into a wifi hotspot for my ipad. Remember to turn off your personal hotspot when finished, otherwise it can continue to use your cellular data in the background. So, I utilize the flexibility of using the online version wherever I go. Its paperless and I can run my business literally from anywhere. Over-all I'm impressed and can work-cross platform or even from my phone if I'm out in the field working. HOWEVER The main features are lacking in the iPad and iPhone/Mac app versions. You have to use a regular computer internet browser such as explorer, chrome or safari to see and use every quickbooks online option available, but don't have access to those options in the iphone, ipad and mac app version. There are times when I'm working with my mac app version or ipad and then I have to enter new business or administrative detail like a new credit card or bank account or more specific details and then the options don't seem to be in the apps at all. Then I have to switch to the internet browser or go to a computer with browser in order to view some of the options I need to complete my task. Kind of disrupts the flow, plus doesn't give 100% full access to all features with the apps, but is very close. Every update it seems they add a lacking feature to the apps so, hopefully they keep adding until the online version AND APPS are full and complete. Got 4 stars for overall versatility and convenience. Didn't get the 5th star due to lack of features in the app version which makes me have to always use or switch to the browser. Inconvenient when I'm out on a Job utilizing my mobile devices then I have to dread finishing up loose ends on the computer when I get home. Also, I would rather use the app because of its quick response and interface, because the internet browser always seems to be clunky and use more computer memory. My suggestion to any Quickbooks rep reading this is to CONCENTRATE ON THE APPS and let the browser be the backup option.","Quality, Experience, App, Estimates, Invoicing, Dashboard"

"No experience needed. You can perform 95% of what you can do on the computer on this app..

"I personally like the iPad app better than the online version for interface, but it has so many bugs!  Constantly gives me error message that I'm not authorized to do something (add/edit a customer, etc.), but then it lets me do it.  But I keep having to close out all the error messages that pop up.  Often won't let me email an invoice.  Won't let me add customer off of creating a new estimate (have to add customer, close, then do estimate and choose customer again).  The list of basic things that should not be an issue goes on and on.  On the iPhone app, there is no place for my reps to view the contact person's name at the company!  I'm sure there are other things I could think of, but I've just learned to compensate and work around things.  However an app with this many bugs should not be out there - it's pretty pathetic!

Now with the latest update I am once again being told my subscription does not exist even though I paid for the whole year. And once again, I am unable to access critical features or anything useful in the app just before tax time. I begin to think this is a scam.

Previous: I loved this app until there was an issue with my subscription. I was locked out of the app when the payment processed a weekend late. Intuit says Apple has to fix it. Apple says Intuit has to fix it. Intuit says they will contact Apple then contact me, the sound of crickets rings through the house. It has been almost a month, no one has fixed it. Meanwhile, I have no way to modify invoices, update my budget, bill, or track sales because the app asks me to subscribe in order to do anything but login. When i push the check subscription button, it confirms that I have one then logs me out and the dance begins again. Best part: Apple won't refund the subscription for the month only stop it for next month and Intuit says they cannot refund anything, so I am paying them to be locked out. This is no way to run a business. No way to retain consumer confidence. And after the New Year I will be using something else. It is a great app, until it breaks.","Subscription, Quality, App, Invoicing, Dashboard, Performance"

Also, many of our customers have multiple rentals, buildings, apartments etc. There isn't anyway to keep these addresses under the same customer.  I have to look at each and every invoice to find the address in the memo section.

"I have subscribed quickbooks essentials over web. The web version is perfect. It has all the key elements that ideally any accounting system should have. Moreover it has very nice and easy to use interface which makes data-entry experience wonderful. 

However the mobile app on the other hand needs some improvements. Although you can do most of the transactions through your mobile but certain things are missing;

1- Creating sales receipts it saves the transaction but the amount goes in undeposited funds and there is no facility to transfer those funds to your bank account

2- Reports are missing. I cannot view any report from the mobile app except for profit and loss report. Even a bank statement is not available","App, Transactions"

It is quite clear that Intuit prefers customers not use PayPal at all, but this is not realistic.  Many of my customers prefer to pay by PayPal.

Problem is, my open QB invoices, now paid through PayPal and migrated through QB, appear  unpaid even though they are paid. Confusing!","Quality, Invoicing, Customer"
"Have been using this program for a couple years. In the begging, it was great (for the most part).  Lately it's been denying my employees and self access, giving me a variety of errors. After spending over an hour with customer service, the conclusion is - their version of the software doesn't function with each and every iOS update. My company sells fresh truffles to hotels, restaurants, resorts, etc... And so, we weigh the truffles on-site, create their invoice while we're in the kitchen and MUST collect a digital signature (through the app itself) to ensure their accounting department will take accountability and pay us in a timely manner. Aside from Truffles being the most expensive food on the planet, they're also the most perishable (90%+ water, which means they/I lose weight/MONEY each hour I sit on them)!  So, beyond not being able to deliver my product in a timely manner, as requested by our customers, we've been forced to SIT on our product and not be able to sell until they fix the problem. All in all, we've probably lost AT LEAST $500-1000 from money literally evaporating into thin air, thanks in large to Quickbooks! Let alone the embarrassment of having to tell our customers we have their product but can't sell it to them.  Not saying the app/software is bad, just don't count on being able to rely on it like we have. Caveat Emptor :(","App, Quality, Customer Service, Subscription, Dashboard"

After you  finally find the invoice by clicking and searching it the software takes you alllll the way back to the first page instead of just remaining where you are. I think that has to be the absolute worst. 3. There is an option to filter invoices but a search bar would work a million times better... Searching for an invoice by date when there were 50 on that day, or by name when there are hundreds in that name, or by balance when there are more than 15 pages to go through is just tiring and a waste of time.

"Yup, yet again another update, and still not useable in multi-user.  How many years will this take to fix a bug since day 1?

Another update and I stand behind my previous review(s).

Seriously? Another update, and still not multi-user friendly.  But, oh boy, something works with Apple Watch.  When will Intuit fix the multi-user issues?  Someone else mentions they fix bugs.  I can say the exact opposite - they leave bugs for years!

I want to use and like this app. I've looked at every update since the very 1st version.  It does seem to be slowly improving, but is still not useable.
My business has more than 1 user account.
Locations and Classes do not work in their accounts.  Not in any sales forms.  Not in expenses.
When my other users go to Customers, they see total sales for the last 90 days.  They do not need to, nor should they see this.

The other option is Xero and I've heard some good things about this though I've never used it. In addition to the poor customer service, I probably run into at least one software issue a month and calling them on that issue is a pain because they do a good job hiding their phone number.

Most of my day is spent with a camera in hand far away from a laptop or office, so I use the iPhone App all the time. It's great! Only additions I might make:  Improve the ability to insert or move item lines while editing/creating invoices, make it easier set up a Customer so I can email multiple individuals within a Customer field when invoicing, make the addition of receipts easier to include (I currently snap shots of paper expense receipts, save to my camera roll, then use the ""add note"" feature in the App. If I have electronic receipts, I have to take a screenshot, then save that to my camera roll, and follow the same ""add note"" routine) It works fine, but it's bit clunky if you have many receipts, which I frequently do.

I had a customer pay two invoices at the same time and three weeks later, I haven't received the payment. I've called Quickbooks, Quickbooks payment center several times and the only thing they do is put you on hold. The wait time is from 30 minutes to an hour, I waited on hold for an hour and was disconnected. They deposited the monies from the two invoices into a account that's not mine, and getting them to correct the problem is like pulling teeth from a hungry lion.

Awesome product recommend,
"This app is fine as a standalone, but has never been able to update any information input, and reflected on all mobile devices. It treats each device as a separate entry. Therefore, when entering a customer on one device, any attempts to then activate and reference that customer on the same device is not possible, because the customer is not found her on that device, even when it tells you it has saved the info. Likewise with transactions. Transactions entered on your PC, do not show up on your mobile devices. All of this seems to contradict the main benefit of QuickBooks online. I will be switching to desktop version as soon as possible.","App, Quality"

The application for QuickBooks online keeps getting better!,
"I am an electrical/mechanical contractor and I have recently switched from Quickbooks Desktop to QBO. Mainly for the mobile ability. I do not do too much with the mobile app, but I do make an occasional invoice or receipt. It is never going to be as fast and easy as doing it on a computer, but it comes in handy. I like to look up past invoices, customer info, or my prices for various materials. The only thing I can really say that I would like to see changed, is the ability to see the vendor/supplier info under a product. I take the time to enter the ""description on purchase forms"" on the computer, but I can't see it on my phone. I have an iPhone 5s and it works great. The map function transitions to the map app seamlessly. I can add photos easily into the QBO app via the ""Notes"" function. Another thing that can't be done on the mobile app is that you can't view inventory info, and if you make an invoice on your pc and added an expense to the invoice, you are not able to view it on the mobile app.","Quality, App, Invoicing, Expenses"

With this software I have now also grown my business into a year round maintenance and landscaping company. I don't see an end to my expansion insight! I'm so streamlined I can beat any competitor to the punch. My clients tell me they normally receive my bid same day whereas by the time they get some of my competitors bids I've already completed the work! Everyone loves the option to pay thru the email!

I DONt LIKE IT!!!",
"The convenience of having access to your data is great of course, but sadly this software is still heavily flawed. One particularly irritating issue is when creating an invoice for a tax exempt customer, QBO insists on adding sales tax and won't even let you remove it. You have to go to the desktop version and edit your invoice there! Tech support has no answers for this. 

Bottom line, if you are thinking about moving your accounting to Quickbooks online, DON'T DO IT.","App, Quality, Invoicing, Transactions, Performance"

"1) - It is tedious and a big waste of time ( for which my clients should not have to pay!) to log out and in to access my and each of my clients' accounts. I have a client with multiple entities and make intercompany entries and this is a PITA by having to log in and out constantly.

2) - The wholesale billing function does not seem to show up on this. Yet another reason to stick to the desktop version.

3) + this is okay for my clients to access if they want to see something quick, such as whether a vendor has been paid or a quick report.

4) + It does have a decent and clean interface, again helpful for my clients to view something simple.

Some things that could make it better...a linked PayPal pay option in the invoice email, and a way for a customer to easily send a notice of payment. Also, if I could pull in new customer or supplier info from my iPhone contact list it would save a fair bit of redundant data entry, as I need the listings both places. 

But all-in-all a real winner.","App, Transactions"
"I love that the on-line version is so much user friendly than the desktop version of QB that we have used for years.  I also love having mobile access to my data.  We have several companies though, and having to log out and back in to QB in order to switch between companies is ridiculous.  Even having to hit so many buttons just to log out is onerous.  I hope they improve that, but overall, I highly recommend the on-line version for people who are need to give easy access to bookkeepers and accountants and who switch between devices like I do.",Quality

"QuickBooks Online (QBO) do not have their own image capture and use Receipt-Bank. The integration between the two is poor. I had taken up QBO to reduce my workload at the end of every quarter in filing UK VAT. However after subscribing for about 2 months I realised that the entire thing needed a lot of time to manage. The teams on either sides advised me that this is a drawback with the tool and settings such that each item has to be defined of the VAT type rather than picking up the VAT amount which is clearly mentioned in all the receipts from Europe. When Receipt-Bank does an Optical recognition and imports data from a photo of the receipt, it clearly shows the VAT amount. However when published to QBO the VAT is removed. To me there may be a simple solution for these but apparently QBO seemed not to be interested in the problem. Rather they simply threw the problem over the wall. Hence I had to unsubscribe from QBO. Hopefully they will resolve the issue. As a small business QBO does not replace my accountant or even reduce my workload. It simply provides a screen shot of the status. It can be suitable for people who has the time to spend on the tool and adjusting the information than the financials itself.","Experience, Transactions"

All of my products and services are ready in drop down menus so I just tap a few buttons while I'm out in the field and I can send receipts, invoices, anything. It's smart and can connect to ALL of my accounts and imports that info to a digital check register. When my CPA need info, I can email it straight from the app or, if you're lazy like me, just give them the login info and they have access to whatever they need.  I've been told that QB can also be automated to send out docs on its own, after the right set up, but I have yet to get to that level.","Quality, Customer, Receipt Capture, Invoicing"

I was disappointed that it would not process supplier invoices and could not handle banking accumulated cash. It seems to handle VAT alright but it does not produce a report to help you put you fill in your VAT return online.
On the plus side the sales invoicing is smooth, although I had a minor issue with a technical error. I like the ability to review the status of your customer and supplier accounts and manage business contacts. The ability to e-mail contacts from the supplier/customer interface is useful.

It's impossible to even know what anything is!  All I see are dollar amounts and dates.  An expense and accounting software is pretty useless unless you can see what your transactions are actually for!

Keep trying Quickbooks!","App, Transactions, Quality, Expenses"
This app is great and very robust,App
Very good app to manage Quickbooks when you are away from your desk.,Expenses
"This is a powerful combination of mobile, camera, and bookkeeping.  Much easier than relying on the desktop.",
I have no complaints.,
"We've been an intuit customer since 2001, this past year we converted to the online version of Quickbooks; never been happier. The simplicity of the app(s) and how easy it is to do common tasks saves us time and money. Keep up the good work!",App
Easy to understand and easy to use and to take care of all payment issue to leave me to do the work,Quality
I like using Quickbooks online because it is simple and effective. Easy to use and uncluttered.,Experience
Lots of functionality right from your phone. I like the fingerprint sign-in when resuming the app. Would be good to see a save as PDF feature on invoices and quotes. I'd like to be able to upload them to the cloud from my phone or attachment them to an existing email I am writing rather than having to email separately.,"App, Invoicing, Receipt Capture"
"Having the app, makes it easier to give my clients an exact total immediately. It also makes it easier to track payments and purchases.",App
The app works well and most everything is in the same place as the desktop version.,App
"The two main things I would like to be able to do with this app aren't possible. 
1) I want to look up my open/unpaid bills to suppliers and see how much is outstanding. The suppliers section only gives me their contact details??? Who decided that would be useful??
2) I want to look up the employees/payroll section to verify payroll info. This isn't there. 

Thankfully I don't need to do create invoices from the app - I can't do it without access to my extensive pricing list (have to just enter an amount).

I also can't do any of these things in the iPad app, nor by logging to the webpage from my phone. I need an actual computer to do it. 

I have found that I can look at my profit and loss graph. It's very pretty. But doesn't help with day to day running of my business. 

Whoever is in charge of designing the functionality of this app - I seriously hope they will be making some changes in the future.","App, Transactions, Quality"
"The transition to the new version was almost unbearably rough, but I am so happy with this platform for my staff + I. Still the gold standard, looking forward to more compatible apps...","App, Transactions"
"I have had some very poor experiences with QuickBooks desktop versions. The product itself is generally fairly good but customer service is ridiculous. So when I was looking for a accounting program to use on the smart phones, I was reluctant to go with QuickBooks after using three different companies and having a good experience with Fresh-books. In the end I only went with QuickBooks because the they were the only ones who had a Canadian payroll system available. So far a horrible mistake. I signed on with my credit card to turn my trial basis into a regular subscription, complete with printed receipt. Now it is still not giving me what I paid for and warning me that my trial period is about to end. That in itself is annoying, but trying to actually contact a real person in their customer service is virtually impossible. In comparison to when they were trying to get me to sign on and were phoning me personally.  So my recommendation is to go with anybody but QuickBooks. Oh, and if there's an actual person who works for QuickBooks, my invoice number is B1–7383544. In case you actually want to fix this disaster.","Customer Service, Transactions, Subscription, Quality"
Makes my life so much easier. I'm able to create and send off the things I need while with a client in the field.,
I have more than a few clients I do bookkeeping for. This apple Ap does a good job of keeping up with their books. The bank feed is by far better than the desktop version and it can be done on my iPhone. I moved my company books from the desktop to qbo so I can invoice on the go instead of waiting to get back to my office.,Invoicing
"I was disappointed to find the iPhone and iPad app did not have beautiful graphics, charts and graphs in the same way the desktop browser version does. I wanted a quick, general overview of where I was at rather than a line by line detail of the most recent transactions.","App, Transactions"
Great app except you can't see the total ar due to you. It's such a simple request but they haven't added it for years now,
How come can't display multiple currencies?,App
Makes accounting and payroll and taxes and everything a complete no-brainer.,Expenses
