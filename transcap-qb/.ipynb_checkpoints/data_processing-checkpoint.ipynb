      "Awesome for first-timers!. I am a new business owner and so far this is working out quite well for me. I’ll start by saying I’ve never taken any classes on business or economics, and as far as employment goes over the course of my adult life I’ve held jobs that require enough knowledge of basic accounting/billing, computer/software, (and other skills of the like) to get by on common sense. When it comes to taxes— that’s a foreign language to me and filing every year has been pretty simple (no major deductions, write-offs, etc. to worry about other than claiming dependents), so TurboTax is typically my go-to.\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, and with this all being new to me, I’ve found that QuickBooks is surprisingly user-friendly and fairly easy to figure out. There are still a few things I look at and I’m like “huh?”, but the customer support is pretty on-point as easy to contact (and work with to get help from). Most of the App interface is self-explanatory and the layout is easy to follow— it’s comfortable, for lack of a better word.\n",
      "\n",
      "Initially, I was going to rate this App at 5 stars because I’m diggin’ it so far... but decided to go with 4 for one reason only— I wish there were more options within the App (as opposed to the online version accessed from a desktop/pc). Too many times, I’ve found myself frustrated because something I want to (or need to) do requires you to log in and use the website and won’t allow the action from the App... and I can’t always get to a computer to do so. Especially since I work in the service industry (not from home or in any other stationary place of business) and I’m always running around or on-site somewhere, so my phone is often all I have to work with. That’s it. Other than that, it’s pretty awesome!\n",

      "Not a trustworthy app. I have just started using this app in mid October and it is now Nov 18, 2019.  When I first signed on, I was offered to use the app for three months at $12.49 per month as a special promotion. Of course I clicked “ok” since I felt to really see if this app would work for me I would need three months to test it.\n",
      "\n",
      "My first impression of this app was good because it did help me to organized all of my income and expenses in a neat clean application. In fact, I was able to balance my money and found missing money .  However, there where many time where I had to reset my phone because the app would freeze. This glitch prevented me from connecting my bank account and credit account to the app itself.  I figured I’ll give it another month to see if this problem gets fixed, I’ll trust it with my account numbers.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Today it only allows me a (read only) version of this app unless I pay the full 24.99 a month, but I’m only on my 2nd month of the promotion that I signed up for.  I still would like to only pay $12.49 like I originally signed up for before I fully commit my entire business to use this app.  I haven’t even connected my credit or bank accounts yet because it still freezes from time to time.  I would not have entered all of my private information as well as my regular customer private information if I knew that intuit was going to go back on their offer on their promotion.  This kind of deal does not inspire trust in using this app.  I have a pic on my phone saying that this was the subscription I originally signed up for\n",

      "Buyer Beware. After just starting my new business I spent a month with the software and enjoyed all the features it had to offer.  However, when it came time to renew my subscription which I was prepared to do there was an issue with their billing system that didn’t allow me to subscribe.  After spending over 8 hours on 4 different phone calls and chat support over 2 days the only solution they’ve offered is to export my data, create a new account, and re-enter all of my data by hand.  Yep, that’s right, they have an import function but their export function doesn’t output in the proper format to import it back into their very own software!  All they offered was 40% off a 6 month subscription for my trouble (a $60 value) to cover the day I spent troubleshooting with them and the day or 2 it will take to re-enter all of my customer, invoice, and expense data by hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "Their customer support people were friendly but were just following basic troubleshooting and even the supervisor I spoke with at the end was unable to make any headway putting a credit card on my account.  I’ll be checking out other solutions like Clientbooks since I don’t want to risk having my data being treated this way.\n",

      "We tried that and in order to get the data out and “easily” back into Quickbooks Desktop I had to have a Windows 7 machine running a particular version of IE - seriously?  We even went further and tried to have your data management team do the conversion for me and even that was impossible since in order to do so I would have to add them as a user to my company data and I can’t do that since I can’t subscribe to add any more data (and apparently neither can you).  Honestly, it’s ridiculous that Intuit doesn’t allow the billing to be updated somehow by your backend team and are trying to make me jump through 100 hoops just to get back to where I was.\n",

      "I recently switched to a new business line but did not update the new phone # in QuickBooks online.  Now, I cannot login in online, I have tried but it wants to send a code to my old business line, which no longer exists... I called and spent an hour with quickbooks online and they couldn’t figure out how to reset my number; I am still unable to access the software online ( ironic, since it’s called “ quickbooks online”). The problem with this is that the iPad/ mobile platform software comes with many limitations, so the only was you can perform certain tasks is to login online.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Next in line is the send invoice button.  You build your invoice, then send it by pressing the send invoice button; unfortunately the invoice does not always send and when it does, on occasion, it does not update properly in the mobile software.  I run my numbers tight and by the book and it’s extremely frustrating when you send off an invoice, it says it was sent, and the receiver actually never receives it. The solution is: A follow up call to every billed client to make sure they have received their invoice.\n",

      "Sneaky subscription fees and invoicing not adequate. I never write reviews but this has bugged me. So I’d heard of QB once before and have seen them advertised as being useful for business owners and the self employed. I decided yesterday to download and give it ago. You’re greeted with a 30 day free trial and then once proceeding and setting up your account you are immediately pressured into buying a “40% discounted” subscription of £5.99 or face paying £9.99 per month forever. So I agreed to it assuming it would be a useful tool and that naturally like any other subscription company the charging period would begin following the 30 day free trial giving you breathing space to cancel if it wasn’t fit for purpose. Well this is not the case. As soon as you commit to the subscription it begins charging you and waived and free trial period! Sneaky and underhand move there.\n",

      "Also - when actually trying the software I tried to add an invoice to my account that I had sent a client recently. It wouldn’t let me add any additional lines onto the invoice which meant I could only add one cost and notes section completely missing the point of being able to break down various different costs on the one same invoice, such as expenses/sales etc. How stupid. \n",

      "On top of this the advertising didn’t make it clear there are two separate apps (business and self employed) so after downloading the QuickBooks app and going through the above it turns out that one is just for Business use not Self Emp. Please amend the app title in the App Store.\n",

      "QuickBooks Online receive payment is terrible. If you can afford to have your customers pay online then have QuickBooks charge you for each payment received then taking those payments on putting hold on them like in them up for three months before releasing the funds then get the software your small business and can’t take the risk of having your customers payment held up at any point for any reason you don’t want this software. I had QuickBooks online and option to receive payments online. Two of my customer made seven consecutive online payments for over $19,000 without notice explanation  or a valid reason. QuickBooks put a hold on the deposits into my account. These same custom previously paid online with no problems the account showed customer payment received but not deposited.

I've uninstalled, hard reboot, and reinstalled several times to no avail.  Then checked the App Store and see they did an \"update\" yesterday.  Typical.  They just cannot seem to leave well enough alone.  The thing has bugs and flaws enough, but they only seem to be able to make it worse, not better.

They are unable to see accounts when they go to attribute an expense to a particular account (or a Class for the matter) and the app doesn't let them add an expense without attributing it to an account.

      "\n",
      "As a sidenote, I read in another review that someone complained about data not being in sync across multiple platforms. I found this as well on a couple of occasions, however, in my situation this was resolved by closing the app and reopening it. I have also had to reboot the app (on every platform) for various other reasons, a remedy that is more than slightly annoying when I am trying to get large quantities of work done.  All of these ills, in my opinion, are attributable to the fact that you're dealing with the remote database, and something gets hung up in communication. \n",
      "\n",
      "Those criticisms aside, QB online does have a lot of great things going for it. It's extremely portable, and does have many of the rudimentary features found in QB desktop. I've been able to look at financial data, send invoices, make vendor payments, as well a whole host of other tasks right from my iPad. \n",

      "Would like to like it better, but it gets worse!. I personally like the iPad app better than the online version for interface, but it has so many bugs!  Constantly gives me error message that I'm not authorized to do something (add/edit a customer, etc.), but then it lets me do it.  But I keep having to close out all the error messages that pop up.  Often won't let me email an invoice.  Won't let me add customer off of creating a new estimate (have to add customer, close, then do estimate and choose customer again).  The list of basic things that should not be an issue goes on and on.  On the iPhone app, there is no place for my reps to view the contact person's name at the company!  I'm sure there are other things I could think of, but I've just learned to compensate and work around things.  However an app with this many bugs should not be out there - it's pretty pathetic!\n",

      "Awesome, but somewhat lacking. I'm an IT Professional who does commercial & residential repairs, contracts, services and sales in person and on my eBay store (I'm self employed and do all this from home) and the quickbooks online version is way easier and faster to use than the traditional computer installed version. Also, I didn't have to cough up $400-$600 for the desktop version (heavy program & used way too much memory) that will eventually be outdated. The desktop version had more options within the software, but the online version is more versatile if your utilizing multiple devices to run your business. As for me, I have a dedicated eBay room with iMac the dedicated tech/repair room with Mac Pro server, the main office AKA my office with iMac and I work from my iPads when I'm in the family area (I have a bluetooth keyboard and treat the iPads as if they were mini-iMacs and I can take signatures while out on a job-site and add receipts and pictures to estimates and invoices or the note section for each customer. If you have a regular wifi ipad like me, now with most companies like Verizon, I can turn on the personal hotspot for free and turn my iphone into a wifi hotspot for my ipad. Remember to turn off your personal hotspot when finished, otherwise it can continue to use your cellular data in the background. So, I utilize the flexibility of using the online version wherever I go. Its paperless and I can run my business literally from anywhere. Over-all I'm impressed and can work-cross platform or even from my phone if I'm out in the field working. HOWEVER The main features are lacking in the iPad and iPhone/Mac app versions. You have to use a regular computer internet browser such as explorer, chrome or safari to see and use every quickbooks online option available, but don't have access to those options in the iphone, ipad and mac app version. There are times when I'm working with my mac app version or ipad and then I have to enter new business or administrative detail like a new credit card or bank account or more specific details and then the options don't seem to be in the apps at all. Then I have to switch to the internet browser or go to a computer with browser in order to view some of the options I need to complete my task. Kind of disrupts the flow, plus doesn't give 100% full access to all features with the apps, but is very close. Every update it seems they add a lacking feature to the apps so, hopefully they keep adding until the online version AND APPS are full and complete. Got 4 stars for overall versatility and convenience. Didn't get the 5th star due to lack of features in the app version which makes me have to always use or switch to the browser. Inconvenient when I'm out on a Job utilizing my mobile devices then I have to dread finishing up loose ends on the computer when I get home. Also, I would rather use the app because of its quick response and interface, because the internet browser always seems to be clunky and use more computer memory. My suggestion to any Quickbooks rep reading this is to CONCENTRATE ON THE APPS and let the browser be the backup option.\n",

I am a landscaper and My office needs to be with me outside, not stuck in an office. I need a program where I can take my work with me to my job site. So, when I meet my customers I can give them an an estimate right away on the spot and be able to email to them write away or be able have my customers sign the estimate right away. I would also like do the same with my invoices. It would make it so much easier to count all the footage and labour at the work site - that I don't forget anything and the homeowners can count with me too. On top, I can complete my invoice on the job site and be able to send it to my customers right away. The iPad is much lighter to carry then carrying a laptop.  More people are choosing the laptop over the desktop for convenience, in the same way, one day people are going to choose the iPad over the laptop. I hope Quickbooks can bring that future now. \n",
