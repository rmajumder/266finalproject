getting better. i can't live without this app. is not perfect but getting better. thank you for the improvements.
great app. this is getting better with each update it makes. i you this app everyday to run my practice and it makes it very convenient because i'm constantly on the road and i don't have to sit at my desk just to enter expenses or send invoices to clients.
. this app works really good makes owning a service business simple. love that i can get done at a customers house and send an invoice
after update statements wont scroll down. after bug fix for ios13, statements wont scroll down. please fix
quickbooks. accounting app
update ruined app. since the last update you cannot run credit cards on the app. it crashes immediately when you attempt to. my business uses qb on 25 devices. all crash when taking payments. this has caused a massive issue for us and clients. beware of putting too many eggs in the basket of a company that can be sloppy with the interface they sell you.
. quickbooks. easy to use. upload pics of receipts when purchased. good reconciliation. matches with bank account. authorised.
. awesome app!!!
great app.. love the app, it's just what i need to do my work.
keep crashing. after last update keep crashing i can't create and send my invoice please fix asap
. online is a bit confusing, this is also. but, once you figure things out, it's great to use.
great. great software
crashing. updated to ios 13 and now the app keeps crashing after face id, please get this sorted as i can‚Äôt run my business
. can't run payroll from the app.
. can't view financial report when i use android phone, could you fix it?
garbage!. they update the app and completely remove support for ios 8! i understand making a newer version only compatible with newer ios, but why block legacy users all together? it worked great on ios 8 before, now the same version of the app suddenly says i need to upgrade! i pay $30month for this garbage!?
mgrm. great app
. why this app is not in french ???
. quick books and intuit do not support you or your business if you get scammed. warning do not use this app for credit card transactions. you get screwed. screwed me out of almost $500
. great app!
after ios 13 update. after updating to ios 13 the app is not opening and i couldn‚Äôt use it.... please look into it and give us a solution
really good, works seamlessly. great for book keeper and employees. very user friendly and a pleasure to use and recommend
. keep track of expenses with this slick app!
. we are really enjoying the convenience of this app
great app. i was reluctant to make the switch to online, but now i'm glad i did! app is awesome and quick. great for small businesses.
. it's very useful but it's only for simple accounting. the complicated stuff has to be done online. i wish quickbooks allowed me to do things like add bank deposits.
. very miss leading and is nothink like the tv advert. not to easy to use and over all disappointed. having to use it because of my accountant. no impressed!!!! also no english call centre's! you can't understand the customer help line team as there english is poor. needs english call centres employing english to overcome this problem!!!!!
ios 13 crash. an awful app that is made even less useful in ios13 because it just crashes straight after running.
decent....but needs work. the mobile app is laid out decent and does work well for the most part. biggest problem i have is you cannot access product quantities or make any purchase orders with the mobile app. need to fix that.
cheap & easy. this program is cheaper than other accounting software & is easy to use.
makes it all the easier. program runs excellent always active on me note 3 a couple of things id love to see added. purchase orders and file attachments to invoices this would perfect it for me.
. great program
. jai presentement un bug. perdu les taxes
. this app loads so unbelievably slowly and hangs all the time. it also has different data from the web version in the p&l reports along with not being able to categorize expenses into some chart of accounts however works fine in the web page version.
. this program will not let me separate my inactive accounts from my active accounts. also navigation is not intuitive to me.
. love it! the invoice screen isn't super userfriendly, but everything else is great so far.
great app. good app. better if it had tracking of vehicle km like the self employed version
sweet baby jesus this is exactly what i need. it has never been so easy to stay so financially organized. as someone who os chronically disorganized this app is a blessing. definitely worth the price when you need to record your expenses and write receipts, invoices and all sorts of other business related things to be professional.
not impressed. started using the app because it was recommended to install it with quickbooks online. the app does not show any up to date transactions that were entered on the quickbooks desktop version, you cannot search by phone number or address only customer name in the app also. i would have thought the app would have been more useful to use while out in the field.
liked it until it stopped working.... it suddenly no longer connects. called quickbooks and they said they don't support the mobile app .... update..contacted developer listed in some of reviews and he got it working...
expensebill data missing in app. expense and bill data is not available in the iphone app while accessible online. what is the meaning of the app when i can't see any of my vendor bills or company expenses. development team???
great app. so helpful. i love the signature on smartphone for delivery confirmation. wish i could process bank statements and send customer statements on the go though.
. love the convenience i have used this app for a while and i enjoy how it facilitates my need to create and track everything on the go. i would recommend quickbooks to any small business operation.
best app ever. i've used qbs for a long time and it gets better every year.
it desont sync. disappointed it desont sync with qbo, tried the settings to refresh the data but still no luck!
easy to use. this app has been a life saver for starting a business and trying to keep the records straight. makes it easy for my accountant to access my records. good job quickbooks
quickbooks. quickbooks on my cell phone keeps me in touch with our office 247. once data is entered by our staff it is immediately updated to my cell phone as well as other devices. for the times our staff had a question regarding entries, the help line for quickbooks was always answered by a person who took a personal interest in our problems and they always found a solution. dorothy apartment rentals
great software. i have a small pest control business. this software is exactly what i was needing. between quickbooks with invoicing and the calendar on my phone, i don't need to get any of those high price business softwares....
like the format. good app
quickbooks app. great app. really useful.
love it!. use it everyday. thank you qbo for making me more productive
awesome. this app is perfect for all users. i haven't found an instance where this app can not be used. it lets the boss and employee work together from anywhere. it can only get better with time. if u need an invoice or quote program. this is your app. (+more). a lot less paper work that's for sure. üòâ
. it takes a little while to get used to it i've always had the desktop version when i had questions the support staff was 100% awesome answered questions research the answers and was able to get back to me with the solution. i've use quickbooks for 25 years and will remain using their product awesome updated version able to use your phone to keep track of receipts
great, not perfect.... if you're looking for snapshots of where your company finances are, this app is great. it works well for giving me good information on the go. however, it seems like real, intensive work is best saved for the online version. i really like it but understand the limitations. worth a try, certainly.
new ios too many bugs. cannot open customer invoices. please correct asap!
. great tool for small business, it can be pricey if you add too many apps to it but in all is great
love it!. we use it for invoicing and i has been a great experience. we love that we can access from anywhere including our smartphones through the app!
. i just wanto cancel my trial before march 5th 2019
fantastic. great bit of kit can do everything i need on the go send invoices and put in my expenses
on job usage. so easy to access invoices and job costing on the job site so easy to make my life easier
business made better. this has been a great experience. it has made billing especially easer and i'm getting paid sooner. two thumbs up. great tech support!!
. it is simple to use
limited. as far as i can see it's not possible to enter expenses. given in many cases businesses have more outgoing transactions that incoming this is a critical weakness.
update needed asap. i also have been using this app for years (it‚Äôs great when working properly) but something happened after this last update and i‚Äôm getting kicked off and signed out in the middle of my invoices and estimates. it‚Äôs staying ‚Äúan important update is required‚Äù or something like that and i‚Äôll go to update the app but it‚Äôs already updated! and i‚Äôll log back into the app and get kicked off again with the same message.....
sweet app!. love the app for keeping track of my ar.
. just awful. i never know if or when it will work properly. i've uninstalled and reinstalled, tried with and without wifi, this app has cost me a lot in time and money. i never know what it will screw up next and support has never once been helpful in solving issues
. this app is super easy to use. love it. idk how many estamates iv created on the fly and converted them to invoices.
. great app for my business, and very simple for first timers
app. very god
. used to work perfect ever since update it's very unreliable. can't log into app reliably. it often locks me out right when i'm standing in a customer's house trying to invoice them or locks me out when i need to go through my client list for a phone number etc. i suggest you consider competitors software until the app becomes stable again.
. great, can create invoices on phone and send on the spot
a difference. i show a difference between the bank and the gl, that does not reconcile but the app isn't giving me any unreconciled items. it doesn't make any sense.
using new app for a week more problems longer i use it. really unhappy  i am missing data and receiving error messages and my only option for assistance is to use a form. am completely disappointed in quickbooks. limited functionality! come on intuit can't do any better than this and keep up with the times i have to use a computer or laptop to get full functionality?!
not working after ios13 update. updated to apples latest software and this app stopped working
very effective. i‚Äôve used very expensive accounting software but quickbooks offers just as much as many do at a fraction of the price.
. perfect app for small businesses onthego!
love it!. quickbooks has changed the way we invoice and track expenses. the ability to provide estimates then convert to invoices is amazing. the mobile app allows me to work on the go.
superb. quite simply the best accounting app i‚Äôve used. it saves so much time!
perfect software for the right companies. i absolutely love it! i have a small freelance design company, so i'm billing for services and commissions. there is nothing i need that it doesn't do and do well. i don't need inventory, estimates or payroll, so this program is about as friendly to me as it could possibly be.
"best app tool for small business. i love everything about it. just please change when emailing estimate, remove ""please pay"" and change to total estimate as it is only estimate and not an invoice."
. great app!!
. awesome book keeping app.
". apps for ordering pizza are more useful. a company like intuit putting out an app with such limited features is unexcusable. fan of qb online, this ""app"" is a waste of space."
new update fail to open. just updated and app will not open
has potential but still glitches. good functionality but i keep getting an error that an item is no longer valid and that i must refresh my data in settings. but there is no refresh option in settings.
convenient. great app now i can do the books from anywhere
. nice...love this app a million times. please download.. very useful and helpful
. great app. as a small business im able to send my customers invoices and customize them to fit my company needs. i love this app and highly recommend to small business owners that needs to keep track of all of thier company finance. thank you quick book for making my life easy.
. great app!
small business. way to complex and slow going to make a new invoice for a new customer on the fly
. very slow and not convenient as current fast trend requirements....it's waste of money..i really suggest for zoho..very good..very fast ....best service and users convenient...
rubbish. doesn't work. need to add bills but can't. how ridiculous to not have this function. deleted. no support from customer service
passwords. i signed up seen the expense and uninstalled it after looking at other apps i decided to return to this app but when i tried signing in it gave me a error message so i tried reseting the password and have entered my verification codes but still can not log in. i would like to possibly purchase the app but this is very difficult since i can't get in
garbage. total trash from the moment of sign up. every single step has been brutal, customer service is non existent and now we have to file dispute through our bank because intuit refuses to cooperate or help with anything. do not use this service. i see them bankrupt within the next few years. customers make the business and they do not care about their customers.
. i use this app for my small business, and it's fantastic everything i need and then some. all in an affordable package,and it's simple to use also.
rather use my local accountant and pay the ¬£100 per annum. rather use my local accountant and pay the ¬£100 per annum
. easy to use. minor software glitches occassionally but great !
. great app. highly recommend.
67 week refund policy!!!. was accidentally charged over $30 for a payroll service i never signed up for...i am the only person employed in my business. contacted customer service and was told i would be refunded within 5 to 7 business days. 2 weeks go by and i had not received the refund so i called customer service and was told it could take up to 6 to 7 weeks to receive my refund!! i am strongly considering canceling my membership with them!!!
. great app to use for companies on the go. can email invoice to customers immediately. love this app!
waste. waste of time money and didn't work for me payed $90.00 for something that even the tech support said sorry for the misunderstanding.
newuser. enjoying the switch from mac to online!
loss of functionality. i had been using this app for a while without any real issues. however, recently the 'expense' button that pulls up from the '+' menu on the home screen is grayed out...thus rendering the app fairly useless on the go! intuit said they unfortunately didn't have the ability to fix issues with the app.
. everything you could ever need to manage a business. financials at a glance and indepth, invoicing made easy, automated payroll, and so much more. 2 employees couldn't replace this app.
great for small business. such a time saver, easy for business owner, accountant and bookkeeper to enter review and lodge bas. love the fact i can take photos of receipts to back them up and also add attachments to invoices etc. such a great software with web access also
"update broke the app. since the update i have to type my password each time i open it after it has been closed for a while. this doesn't work in front of customers. (yes, i enabled touchid. the problem seem to be hitting others and is based on now intuit decided to ""fix"" touchid by breaking it in this version)"
". made an payment 3 days ago and still getting an error ""subscription error"" ereceipt sent. update, it's been 5 days and i'm still locked out of my account after payment was made. quickbooks has offered to transfer payment method directly to them. google play informed me that quickbooks refuses to refund my subscription, while quickbooks denies that that is the case. fyi been a quickbooks user for 3 years now, and never had an issue, til now."
user friendly. very happy so far....
can't bring myself to use it.. it's nowhere near as useful as the desktop app. i'd love to be able to create an invoice on my phone or tablet and upload photos right from the device. can't do it yet.
crashing at start up with ios 13. love this app but it crashes with ios 13 :( please fix
nothing but disappointment. car tracking constantly shows that there is uncategorised trips when it is up to date. software won‚Äôt integrate with desktop version. 3 days before end of financial year quickbooks stops bank account updating inputs. then quickbooks support solution causes double entries. two week later accounts won‚Äôt update anymore again.
good app. very detailed , im no pro @ accounting but i am teaching myself this app. its very in depth and i like it.
great book keeping app. use this app with the online version at home. very happy with it indeed. support could be a little better. but support is adequate. been using it for a couple of years and i'm very pleased.
. fabulous for some things great for running my small business. still lots of room for improvement in user friendlyness.
. they just did a huge update and didn't change any of the items i'm having problems with. the app is useless to me with line items abbreviated. how do i know what i'm entering?
great app. the quickbooks application allows me to quickly see my bank accounts, profit and loss statements, balance sheet, invoices etc.
small business owner. i have been skeptical about leaving all my business information in an external server, thinking that one day, the software seller is not longer in business. intuit has given me that confidence and now i am very excited with services i have received so far. the program is easy to set up and easy to use. very friendly menus. you can use as many functions you wish. is good even for those who have little experience keeping track of business.
big learning curve to start, but very powerful. it was hard work to start with (owing to my limited knowledge), but good online tutorials and support helped a lot  very happy with the package now after a few months of getting my head around it!
not impressed.. i literally have to 'reset' my password about 9 out of 10 times when i go to use this app....it keeps telling me my user name or password are wrong(they are actually not) and so i keep 'changing' my password to the same password that it has been......very frustrating that almost every time i am visiting a client, i have to spend 810 minutes on accessing the info from the app.
nexus 6p problems. still does not work on nexus 6. i'm trying to run a business this app use to make me efficient. now it sucks that i can no longer log in to upload receipts. i would give it zero if i could.
ap crashes instantly on my iphone x. i have been a quickbooks user for about 3 years already. ever since i got my iphone x app doesn‚Äôt even open. i have tried hard restart, setting as a new iphone and still encounter the same problems. it‚Äôs incredible that i‚Äôm not able to use it now.
. great app and very user friendly! love that i can create documents right from my phone!
. nice niceeee
. useful. allows invoicing, and updates on the go!
very limited!. i prepare weeks of invoices on my desktop for my 3 crews. unfortunate the online version rarely finds the invoices, and i end up having to go back to the old way of exporting pdf invoices. i feel like the desktop has so many flaws already, and the app is basically a worse version. i expect more from a legit company, but maybe i'm asking too much.
fantastic app for my ipad pro!. i recently acquired an ipad pro to use for my business and instantly downloaded quickbooks to use on the go. this app has been wonderful for sending invoices, logging my expenses, and managing the books in general. so far, i have yet to experience a crash and everything has been working well for my needs!
waste of money. it seems like they are doing what every other company is doing. charging more for less. switched over to qb online and it has been a waste of money. no customization what so ever. looking for another program with better interface.
still unresolved issues 3 month later. i‚Äôve had quickbooks for over 3 month now and since i‚Äôve had it i have been unable to allocate my bank transactions on my app. i‚Äôve flagged this to quickbooks and had responses but no fix. keep being told to use desktop version for now! 3 months and still not fixed isn‚Äôt good enough for a payed for app.
. zero! the app says it needs to update, then brings me to a screen giving a choice of uninstall or open. if i choose open, i'm back to the need to update. if i uninstall and reinstall, that's just more steps before i'm back to the same useless place. garbage software.
very nice app. very easy to use and make my all estimates and invoices very smooth and keep the updates very soon
. this app is great for tracking income and expenses! feels good to know how i am doing on a dailyweeklymonthlyqtrlyannual basis. keeps me competitive and on track financially.
excellent app. im using quickbooks plus online n also the app..its easy to use...but sometime delay to update in the app after do activity in desktop.. ‚ò∫
fix finally now i can get back to work.. this version fixed the errors from the last update. glad it working again. quickbooks has been good except the last update. this one fixed the issue. we us this app for our onsite business and it's great. several times i would send an invoice to the customer when i'm leaving their home and before i get to the next job it's already paid.
wish you integrated with monzo. my life would be complete!
missing functionality  registers updated. the app itself is pretty clean and easy to use. however it is missing some important functionality, namely registers. there is no access to your bank or credit card registers, or to check their respective balances... for a financial application, this is a major missing piece. here's hoping this will be added soon. update: this has been fixed. now waiting for making deposits...
sales tax calculation is wrong. when creating an invoice, the app does not honor customer's sales tax setting. it applies tax even on customers with tax turned off. please fix asap!!!!
sales tax. cannot use the app on my phone because it does not calculate sales tax correctly. spoke with customer service. they know the issue and do not seem to think it‚Äôs important to fix it. makes the app almost useless to me
. great accounting software
nice. i love app
quickbbooks online app. very easy to use and syncs effortlessly with your accounts data held in the cloud. a real time saver!
. missing inventory and purchase order section
login' this app. makes my life so much easier. i can do everything on the go. saves time! love it!
. convenient, but i wish i were more familiar with business accounting. not for beginners.
very good.. we've been using this app and have been very impressed with it.
elecsmart electricians london. i have used the online version but now prefer the app as it seems to be more stable. worth the money and great for a progressive company!
awesome..... this app is awesome...
quickbooks online. great app!
. incredibly buggy, takes forever to open and crashes on every action. cannot move from xero to quickbooks while the apps remains this bad.
expenses. how do add an expense thats on a 30 or 60 day account?
awesome. the app provides an excellent opportunity to update all expenditures to find out exactly what's in my bank account anywhere i have signal for my phone.
. used to be fantastic now all you get it duplicated invoices, inability to sync with the cloud and invoice saves that can take over 30 mins to finalise! hopeless...
a+. app works great
". creo est√° app buena administraci√≥n de empresas x ese motivo desidi "" instalarla y google como responsable de negocios, se entienda, bien con esta empresa y tiene juegos de loter√≠a de los casinos, tambi√©n, para yo jugar en ratitos,"
. good app
. seems to work well, very useful way of sorting receipts
price just keeps going up!. forced to moved to a different app, found this one for ¬£2.99 a month, which seemed fine as i won‚Äôt be using it very much. now the price has gone up to ¬£11.99 in under a year! needs different payment options for those that don‚Äôt use it much and that % increase is insane.
. the app has not been working properly for over 2 weeks now.
. problem in sigin to app
you need to purchase one per company. if you own multiple companies this software may not work for you. unless you rather pay double and in my case triple for each software per company. highly disappointed and no one that would solve it. regretfully invested.
. easy to use, very good app to invoice an manage the accountant anywere
nice app. needs few more improvements
need an important upgrade. i love the app and all the updates but we really need to information from journal entries to show up in the expenses on the app. it shows up on a computer but the app gives us false information.
touch id not working when app is shut down.. touch id needs to work all the time. not just when app is running in the back ground. come on quickbooks fix this bug.
. not all customer payments showing on android, on iphone was no issues except some crashes from time to time and signing out by itself.
garbage. signed up to their free trial, spent hours putting up my receipts only to be told i have to start again because of an error at their end. now locked out of my account and all my original receipts have faded taking even more hours trying to communicate with them to gain access to my account
. financial software on the go
fix needed. over all ok program... the problem is you can get an error, saying deposit on hold. not your problem as a user, the user did nothing wrong. and quickbooks will not fix it. your account balance will be off and no way to fix it. all quickbooks fault and they don't care, support it or fix it! very bad customer service!!!
jason marquez. this app according to me is best as it's not that complicated and makes my business easy, i've not used any other accounting app so i consider this very easy for any layman who is not very good in accounting. it could have had few more options like individual job closing so to get more accurate and decrease the paper work.
. i really like it for the most part.. would love to see the invoice number self populate when going to send out the email
works well but need enhancements. the app works well and easy to use. i will appreciate if it can be enhanced to accommodate advance payments and accruals
. great app. makes paperwork a lot easier.
. great for you business. i love how i can quickly add an expense by taking a photo of the receipt as well as logging payments on the go. its awesome that you have your data right there at the touch of a button.
best small business app!. awesome app! very helpful
muito satisfeita!. excelente ferramenta de gest√£o. f√°cil de trabalhar, f√°cil de aprender, voc√™ pode montar v√°rios relat√≥rios e os prontos s√£o √≥timos. estou encantada com a facilidade de uso do programa!:d
so far so good.. i spent about nine or 10 hours trying to get my quickbooks program converted over to my mobile phone from my desktop after speaking with someone that barely spoke any english for six or seven hours i was told to call back the following day because they could not figure out what i needed to get done when i called back the next day thank god someone that spoke english answered and i had my problem resolved in about 20 minutes.
making life easy. qbs has enabled me as an absolute novice to business manage the financials of all components of my business. the ability for my accountant to look in and assist were necessary and conduct tax admin such as bas preparation has been such a relief. making life easy in small business is a welcome capability.
owner operator. on the go? this app will help your business keep going without slowing down!
. the banking rarely syncs.. it hasn't synched in 15 days now! i know most of my invoices have been paid but i can't mark them off in the app and it's starting to get confusing. i can't tell which invoices are really over due... it's not the first time this has happened, it needs to be fixed!
. i am really thankful for this opportunity. this app vary great easily to use with simple and useful. thanks
. super easy to learn. love that it keeps all of my customers info!

best for small businesses on the go. i'm a cpa consultant that specializes in accounting systems and qb and its other products qbo are the most popular in our vancouver market. it's popular simple to use, has good built in reporting, and lots of apps. and it's adaptable for virtually all small businesses.
quickbooks renew account??. renewed my subscription for a year and i'm still locked out, every time i log in it keeps telling me to subscribe for 1 month i tried to go that way and it asked if i wanted to change my current year subscription? makes no sense.. wish some (tech support or program owner) fixes it i'm about to cancel it all..... wy small business owner
crashes since ios13. i can no longer open my quickbooks on my phone since the ios 13 update has been released.
very good app. give the ability to capture signatures and it will be great.
. office on the go! i run a tree service so i'm never in the office. this app let's me take care of businesses while in the field and frees up time when i get home at night.
. i already had installed an intuit app tried to sign up with my email said i already had an account my password no longer works to confusing for now to try and log in verfication codes sent
. good app very nice and handy
needs some work. this app is good but needs more work. error message kept popping up while working in it. some tasks are missing like entering bills. can't find sign out button or switch to a different company.
love it. works hand in hand with my computer program
. simple and very efficient! send invoices ..receipts taxes. everything in one place! love it!
hong leong connect first. i don‚Äôt get to link to my leong connect first account. please fix this so that i use it right away. my sister told me this app is superb.
. i've been trying to download the app for 12 hours. i've got solid internet. i've restarted my phone twice. it wouldn't let me submit a comment until now. what's up?
update = crash. haven't been able to use app since updated. disrupting my business. will not open.
. it's a good app only thing is sometimes it takes a while to upload but it could be the servers of our phone
user. the best accounting app ever!
can‚Äôt accept transactions. latest update broke ability to match transactions. it‚Äôs like that screen is locked accept buttonsearch or selecting another expense doesn‚Äôt work.
good functionality but slow to load. great functionality, good app but it takes too long to load. i don't need the homescreen with current activity to load each time. i just want to add an invoice.
. if you have to write off expenses for your business like meals, travel ect.....get this app now!!!! very simple and user friendly.
killer app. killer service.. the app is great, arguably better than the online version. great for keeping track of transactions and uploading photos of receipts.
excellent app. keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
. i am enjoying this app so far but would be much better if i could also use it on my kindle fire. please make an app for that too!
helps me so much. new business owner, this app has been so helpful. can do estimates send invoices and input expenses from any where, weather im at the store or on the go i can work
how bad????. i would love to write a review, but as i've been trying to get this app to log in to my online account for 5 months now it's going to be a little difficult. but not as difficult as trying to get any customer support for this app. i could write a whole book on how impossible that is. so so disappointed. no help with this problem what so ever. frustrated!!!!!
keeps crashing. every time i try to upload a receipt from my phone, it crashes when i press save & doesn‚Äôt save at all. i‚Äôve tried closing the app & trying again, but it does it every time, so basically i can‚Äôt take a picture of any receipt & upload it. please fix!
home improvement. great app
owner. i have been quite impressed! small owneroperator, able to send invoices, estimates, et al. from my trucklove it!
"ridiculous!. i can't believe that i pay $20 a month for an app that won't even let me ""break out"" deposits!!! i am treasurer for a non profit organization and this is crazy! my $ could, and will be spent elsewhere."
master electrician. this app has done everything that i have asked of it. fantastic of estimating, invoicing and receiving payments in the field while on the job site. really saves me time.
intuit. excelenta si detaliata
love quickbooks hate new limited invoice styles update. love quickbooks hate new limited invoice styles update
great app!. very useful, but i think it still needs some work. very limited, need to offer more functions.
. i've just started using qb and i'm very impressed. i was using xero and truelly,it has been horrendous. qb all the way. so user friendly.
. issue with app was directed in app to call quickbooks online customer service. no solution after being on the phone for 2 hours, they ended up calling android and at&t to try and fix the issue, which made absolutely no sense to me and got us nowhere. customer service has no clue about anything app related including when the password reset does not send verification code. i ended up having a different company to resolve the issue for me. below instructions solved nothing.
great app.
. much better than another accounting app that also ends in 'books'. works fine for me
great app. i love it! it keeps everything organized!
. app with easy to use features
. quick books online is perfect for a small business owner like myself. i can have a professional bookkeeping,payroll, and tax service with also being able to provide estimates and invoices out in the field. its perfect!! thanks so much much quick books. trey blocker blocket tree service
. can retrieve the old account but it won't re activate. created a new account and password.. can't log in. seems to be an app issue or software
. great app, can do pretty much everything i need to right from my phone, but is also a seamless transition to my computer.
bad update. befoe you used to record bank feed but no more! this update ruined the quickbooks app
unable to sync. all i get is errors about syncing. different phones. same problem. works great in my ipad, though!
cbcllc. love it just need to add a little more of access on ipad and mobile device. love to have a check signature
wonderful app for freelancers. likes: stores repeat client info  allows for cc payment  allows me to include my company logo and information on each invoice.  alerts me of tardy invoices  provides me with easy to read charts and measure each months incomeexpenses dislikes:  credit card payments incurs a hefty fee rather than a monthly charge  all of my invoices have an intuit logo  customer service is not great
hate the app. limited functionality of the app makes it virtually useless... unless i have access to a pic or laptop, i can't do all the things i need to do. the program itself is good, just not sure why the app hasn't caught up yet.
. i can't remove the date from my columns on a quote. several days and still no reply from your support team. extremely poor. if you wish to cater to businesses then you need better support. i emailed and posted but no reply. i have quotes overdue and am losing customers. i want this product but not if there is no support.
signed up with incorrect email... how can i reset password without the right email?. email error
meh. constantly making me sign out. constantly not updated with what‚Äôs online. constantly telling me i‚Äôve got outstanding invoices that have long. we. recorded online.
great for my business. the app makes checking banking records and status of transfers easy. the app is also very intuitive. highly recommend.
absolutely inconsistent. probably the worst app i had on my phone. i have deleted it. it gives incorrect, inconsistent notifications. it‚Äôs completely useless to access certain parts of qbo. how incredibly unfortunate that intuit can‚Äôt build an app that can compare with the advances made in qbo.
couldn‚Äôt get past sign up!. i downloaded the app and started the ‚Äúfreetrial‚Äù setup. it asked for my business name, then my countryregion. when i tapped to enter countryregion, it gave no options. it was blank and did not bring up keyboard for manual entry. so i can‚Äôt even use it.
love it. small business, no need for a more complicated program, cane send estimates and invoices from my phone. fantastic
ok.. maybe i'm just used to regular qb's but i'm having a hard time with this. and why is it i have access to more on the computer than the app? other than that is great. very helpful.
friendly app. looking for the app to start your business look no further then this. i've started to use it and it's very easy to use.
. excellent app.
. i like it. i came across a bug at the start but i called quickbooks and they resolved it the next day thankfully
unfair and idiotic. your supervisor told me i would receive 3 months free quickbooks online...then i get a bill...then you refund my account and cancel it???!!! wow! and then waste hours of my time telling me you can't give me 3 months free? this is starting to look like a scam! not to mention the 1 star rating you receive from consumer affairs. you guys need to wake up and be professional!!
. well after the experience so far it's great when i need to merge all apps at home then i can rate better. customer service has been just awesome so far. thanks it makes tracking expenses easy as taking a picture and putting the irs info in.
great app. absolutely awesome tool for my company
tons of bugs and glitches. there are lots of glitches and lack of features in this app. the vendor transaction history is spotty, many vendors and missing history all together. profit and loss report doesn‚Äôt scroll. can‚Äôt see the true checkbook register of checks that are written out but haven‚Äôt yet cleared. it‚Äôs really not very good.
great accounting. the app is great and syncs perfectly with my quickbooks online account. makes billing from multiple sites quick and easy on the go.
. great app. very helpful for my small business.
sssloooow so very slow. latest update takes forever to load splash screen about 8 seconds then face id happens fast then loading data: no problems. just takes for ever on the front side to get going.
not working. i have been using for years on my pc and ipad. now all of a sudden the mobile app is not working on my ipad. not recognizing my email. spoke to tech support....supposed to be fixed but it‚Äôs not.
update ruined app. since the last update you cannot run credit cards on the app. it crashes immediately when you attempt to. my business uses qb on 25 devices. all crash when taking payments. this has caused a massive issue for us and clients. beware of putting too many eggs in the basket of a company that can be sloppy with the interface they sell you.
superb app. i'm an electrician and run my entire business on this app it's makes my life so easy :)
". loving being able to access and invoice on the go! can be slow but so can online. entering invoices on phone i have to hide the keyboard to go to next field  be good to have ""next"" button."
. not as user friendly as the desktop edition, but it does that job well.
not working. i have been using for years on my pc and ipad. now all of a sudden the mobile app is not working on my ipad. not recognizing my email. spoke to tech support....supposed to be fixed but it‚Äôs not.
to much money. i went on to the app and it says 35 dollars and i think it is to much money for an app!!!!!! it sould be at the most 20$
. good experience
great book keeping app. use this app with the online version at home. very happy with it indeed. support could be a little better. but support is adequate. been using it for a couple of years and i'm very pleased.
easy to work with. it's just incredible to use and work with.
. working great. people complaining about the price aren't using all of the features. i now pay less because i got rid of other programs and apps.
good app. i like simple, this is efficient for my small busines, updates are making the app better. i can recomend it is supper easy to use.
. very useful
. with no access to the register and a very clunky interface the app is very difficult to use. it is far from useless but also far from essential.
qb makes me look good. qb app is fantastic. i can write and present an estimate right at the job site or give my customer an invoice, or accept payment. in brief....it makes me look good!
makes accounting a breeze. this app is great. link it to your account and it quickly learns how to categorize your expenses. then all you have to do is confirm or adjust as needed. üëçüëç
. great app
. the app worked great before, it had some minor issues here or there but now it is horrible. when i try to add an expense it only shows me 4 of my vendors and the only account i can assign is the cogs account. now i have to save all my receipts and remember to enter them when i get back to the office. what a pain. yes, my desktop app works just fine. please fix the issue, i loved the functionality before.
. game changer. invoicing and tracking expenses just got so easy. it's amazing, and i am only sad i didn't know about it sooner!
needs additional function. this is a great app for limited situations. it needs support for bills, deposits, and bill payments.
bugs & functions. fair but still a lot of bugs with tablets. mis more functions like crm programs. and would nice to have more control clients groups, commissions, as well as price list, like ,distributions, whole sale, or final client...
does not work. cannot trust any invoices under clients or vendorsall are bad. only thing it can be used for is to take a photo of a receipt and add it to a vendors account. can make up an estimate in the field otherwise it is terrible
. easy to use. mobile app is good for searching previously created invoices. i prefer desktop version for using all other tools.
great app. great for on the go owners.
no inventory tracking, no reminder. very disappointed with this no inventory tracking, no reminder for the app no not also for me its pointless quickbooks you better fix it i am cancelling my subscription
michael a. plouffe, jr.  business development. i love it! so far, no issues. just a matter of learning how to use the many tools to my advantage! once as a company we get it down, sky is the limit! allowing my job to be much easier, organized and with an accurate customer data base! michael a. plouffe, jr. head of business development premier sealcoating & line striping inc. sealerseller@gmail.com www.premiersealcoatingma.com
". downloaded the app to be able to view estimates and invoices from phone while i'm away from my computer and someone calls wanting to know ""how much did we have in this job or that job"" well, the app is prettt useless when you have hundreds of estimates out and you're trying to find a particular one , but there is no ""search"" tool to look for what you're trying to find."
fantastic software !. currently in a middle of a building site, sending clients invoice & estimates. now my time is my own this evening ! couldn‚Äôt do with out it .
access. this app is great. it is so nice to be out in the field looking at a project and make an estimate right then and there while things are fresh in your mind. not to mention for the quick service call we are able to make our invoice right there and present it when we are complete with the work. aloha po'okela lawn service kailua, hawaii
touch id does not work. i have it checked and yet when i load the app it keeps asking for password. pointless, just remove touch id as an option since it does not work as it should.
. i asked for a refund after getting the same app in another one of their products and no one responded. i dislike needing to write bad reviews.
. i do invoices and print from my recliner. love this app. and sometimes generate estimates minutes after finishing my work before leaving the clients home. very convenient !!
. easy to use and my accountant recommended it highly.
it's ok but don't get the most basic package. it's a vast improvement on another app i tried but the most basic pack makes me want more, upgrading now if i can so recommend you start with a higher grade package rather than the cheapest.
crashes!. just crashes every time on ios 13
quickbooks slow and hard to work. hard to understand and work. cannot pay on invoices on phone but can on computer. system is slow. give me the old system any day
love this app!!. could run our company without it!!
getting better with every upgrade.. great app. they do lure you with the free use then hit ya with the charges later. i think it's a useful tool in the toolbox.
. easy and simple.
love it but...... i hate when i have a hard time logging in. same password for years but somehow this app throws a tantrum about me login in on different devices. not cool! as long as the password and username is correct i see no reason for me to have to get a code sent to my email. it wastes my time.
. it would be great if you could see what the bank balance is. new update, you can now see your balance sheet so you can tell what your bank balance. good update.
. mediocre app.
fix finally now i can get back to work.. this version fixed the errors from the last update. glad it working again. quickbooks has been good except the last update. this one fixed the issue. we us this app for our onsite business and it's great. several times i would send an invoice to the customer when i'm leaving their home and before i get to the next job it's already paid. update. does not work again. :(
. qbo is great... however, the app sucks! the info on the home page is rarely if ever correct. paid invoices show as still do, p&l info is incorrect compared to what it shows on the website. now i can't edit downloaded transaction to add an image of my receipts. plus, it's no longer showing all of my accounts when i go to categorize a transaction. what the heck happened?!
i‚Äôm loving quickbooks. quickbooks makes life so much easier! thank you so much!
. pc or macbook apps are good but i am sorry to say that this app is waste of time. very slow. page loading time is more that 1 min even with wifi having 100mb broadband speed.
well made basic accounting. quickbooks online has been extremely useful. i have a small contracting business, and i can record an expense in seconds, photo the receipt, create an invoice or estimate, and email these to customers. syncs instantly and automatically across multiple devices, so it's on my phone, tablet and online. the cost is tiny, and it takes care of itself  no more shoebox!
small business owner. absolutely awful. i was forced to switch to online because of a fatal error of the desktop version on mac seirra. there are so many bugs and things that aren't available on online that were on the desktop. i literally call support for 2hrs a day.
. amazing app
functional. easy. efficient. beautiful.. what more can i say? i am an independent film producer that is often out of the office. i prefer this app to the web version on my laptop. wow! this app alone makes the purchase of my iphone 7plus worth every dime.
. the quickbooks app allows me to easily manage my business expenses on the go and eliminates the need to keep those annoying receipts. instead you can jt take a picture of the receipt and attach it to the expense. brilliant.
. why doesn't this app work at all on my samsung?? its saying it can't be supported.
crashes when adding images of receipts. i want to give it 4 stars, but the 2 things i do are problematic. crashes when saving images of receipts every 3 or 4 times. also i can't add time entries which would be incredibly helpful. really close to awesome though.
work done sheets. this is good. could there be a work sheets which can carry information like cossh, removals of waste, costs of material and work done which could be added dates gps photo to the invoice. i really think this would make this program the best. cheers tim
not even close to online or desktop versions. at the cost of not wanting to hire a secretary my consultant had me switch to online version from desktop, it sucks! used to update q.b. desktop every 3 yrs (when forced to) for $150 and now pay around $400 a year for less function. the direct qb online site is better from my mobile device than the actual app. the options between app and website dont function the same. terrible!
love it. very useful
. slow app but super useful
"it was good no it's just horrible. i used to be able to update my invoices from my phone and now it just locks me out. it also used to show when customers viewed my invoices but now it keeps saying ""it might not be up to date"". after 7 years with them. i'm going to find a new pos at the beginning of the year."
. great app and can finally look at my invoices on the job.
. nice app would like the maps feature that uses location points like in the ios version.
. quickbooks is super useful for invoicing clients and sending receipts and estimates. there was a brief period of a few days when it wasn't working that was super annoying because it made me realize how useful it is.
". update 101619: still useless as constant login issues persist, why use the app if i constantly have to uninstallreinstall + clear cachedata. constantly unable to use app  login, keep getting ""temporarily unavailable"" !!!"
was great and then they updated it. i loved this app when i first got it. i used it all the time for 5 months strait, and then they 'updated' it. now, it's awful. i don't see any of the new features and it is buggy beyond belief. please go back to the older version. this is a joke.
. easy to use to add expenses
i was using quickbooks desktop. i really like using quickbooks online, especially like the synching, capabilities; it is much more convenient to login with any device.
. it is a huge mental relief to have this app acting as a virtual accountant for me and i am not drowning in papers. much love!
organization. finally found a way to do things faster and keep me organized!! with qb app i can easily go into my account and make an invoice, pay a bill, and add my deposits as soon as i do them without waiting until i'm in my office to do everything.
cant connect !!!. cannot use my account , fix it please !
. easier then i thought and there's always someone to help. highly recommend for your start up, or for new business owners like myself. üëçüëç
don't do latest update. was working great until latest update. now i cannot create any invoices.
been asking for a simple feature for years.. still to this day i‚Äôm amazed i cannot do the most important task on the mobile app. if i‚Äôve created an expense via my desktop. i have no way of viewing it or editing it on the mobile version. it‚Äôs totally un integrated.
. user friendly. very helpful for invoices.
keep crashing. after last update keep crashing i can't create and send my invoice please fix asap
works but needs work. for the most part the product works, but has many errors and sometimes says there are errors but they are never fixed, i run the lasted ios on an iphone 6 and still have many problems
easy. i have found this app very easy to use. being able to tap into your invoicing system when out on a job. it enables me to issue an invoice same moment the job is finished and emailed to my customer stood in front of me, that way my customer has a paperless invoice and can pay you right away. saves time!
. easy use for on the road estimates and invoices.
doesn‚Äôt sync with quickbooks online account. the app isn‚Äôt syncing with online account data. was hoping to use the app for quick entry while on the go.
good app, but could be better. the app is good but could be better with more functionality. for example not being able to add 'bills' but you can add 'expenses' a small change but would make the app much better.
great stuff.. i like this app. (my extensive review).
trina gordon (happee momentz). great app! my business couldn‚Äôt function without it!
. good app, but need an expert.
c'mon, you know you need it. subscribe already. better than zoho or jobber. very organized and useful. such a time saver and it makes my company look 5 times more professional. recommended!
brian peterson remodel. great app. wish i could attach pictures to estimates and invoices using my mobile app.
. its a great app.
great & smooth accounting app. very good up to keep on top of your finances . it's the best on the market.
. i am really thankful for this opportunity. this app vary great easily to use with simple and useful. thanks
reports needed. need simple reports such as sales tally for a given day. unnecessary steps required for multiple entries, should use 'save and next.'
crash issues. this app crashes on the new iphone 11 pro max using ios 13. please release updates to resolve the issue.
. this app is very useful for preparing and sending quotes and invoices on the go. so if i'm out of the office for the day, i can get work done.
makes life easier!. helps me keep record of everything from invoices, payments customers and expenses.
broken. for the last two weeks every time i log in it tells me i have no online company.
decent. great for checking in on the fly, but a few more features would be great. i have a feeling they'll come in time.
limited to the essentials. great app!
. great app easy to navigate
. software works ok and only ok. however the monthly price seems to have gone up exponentially for no reason over the last 2 years.
. great app
. great with invoices and estimates on the go. and i can see our sales dashboard wherever we go.
works well, missing hours and job cost report. pretty happy with qbo, wish it had a job cost report, wish the app would let me enter hours for employees.
great app. love having qb on my phone to receive payments, send invoices and other routine activities.
. worthless program. i am a quickbooks pro advisor and user for 20 years. this just does not work well and there are better applications out there.
needs more estimate print fields options. need to be able to print estimates & invoices showing 'only' discounted net prices for the line items. my customers hate that they have to do the math for each line. otherwise, this is awesome. thank you intuit for everything you do!
everything i need right from my phone. so handy to be able to do estimates, invoices, and record my expenses right from my phone! will save a lot of time with bookkeeping as now i can enter everything on the go.
time saver!!!. i have been using it online, now with the app it goes by so much faster!!
. was wary, but the convenience is worth a lot until the latest update. now i cant sign on. been a week since they told me there was an issue. still not resolved. spent several hours on hold listing to garbled elevator music that can not be turned down. customer support blows.
. great app, makes my life much easier!!
. great app
poor need lots of work. this app is terrible on the ios and android. i‚Äôm using it on both and it has tooo many bugs...
sign in issue. great app, except the need to confirm with text or email every time upon sign in!! would have rated higher with out this issue. very frustrating
nicely integrated. this app integrates really well with quickbooks online account. features get added regularly.
quickbooks mobile. can‚Äôt print mobile.... on a mobile app. still writing invoices and entering them later 2x the work and the price keeps going up.
. seriously? this is the best you can do? ! so limited on basic functions. *updated review nice try quickbooks on the reply...no, your laughable update is ridiculous! not to mention the mobile device website lockout to access via mobile browser.... taking away another star for bad public relations. welcome to 1996 if you try to rely on this app for your 2014 business.
good, not great.. quickbooks online can do everything i need it to do. but i have trouble getting invoices, quotes and expenses saved to the cloud. it's annoying and aggravating to be waiting for things to upload. if the cloud sync thing worked seamlessly, then it's a 55 for sure.
. great if your a plumber and on the go all day
app crashes. since the recent update i can't get past the login page before the app crashes. makes doing work harder. what's next?
no supplier invoice. invoices from suppliers can not be captured on the app. you have to log onto the main website  which is extremely slow and cluttered to navigate on a mobile phone.
. might need to buy an apple phone again this android version is useless.
. you have to pay and i am looking for a free app to do my stuff
very limited. i like quickbooks, but the ipad application is very limited on its ability to work compared to the website and the desktop application they offer. it needs a lot of improvement since the ipad can handle the workload.
so simple. i love this programme. i allows my wife and accountant to see and work on everything at the same time as me out on the road. it has saved me so much time i can't quantify.
. app stopped syncing transactions, useless!
. working great, really makes it simple
. been using quick books for my small business for years makes accounting & finances really simple.
. app freezes and crashes several times a day. the photo receipt scan feature is probably the biggest culprit. even simple things like updating my business contact information yields an error message which is usually followed by a crash. the mac version of qbo isn't any better. similar issues there. very clunky, buggy applications. too much time spent troubleshooting. time for an alternative.
. update 2020: since the last 2 updates, the app is broken now and does not work at all. can't log in, and just get a 'device appears to be offline' message.
demoted from 5 stars to 4. using the app on ipad and iphone for more than 5 years. dashboard has been unable to properly show invoice status for at least 3 months now. version 17.9, at least 3 updates ago? no fix yet nor response from intuit after feedback. while i‚Äôm not fond of frequent updates, one expects to have these kinds of obvious bugs fixed in the next update.
need price levels. this app is ok but it's been out for a while now and we still do not have pricing levels. it has been in the works according to qb for almost 2 years and we still don't have it plus i can't go back to desktop program because data will not import properly need something done asap. you raised the price but cant give us what we need!!!!
. i like it when on the desktop it's easy to use but downloaded the app on my phone and i can't even log on!
the worst app ever. this app is the worst app i have ever used. takes too long to update data .... and sync hardly ever works... does not have overview screen where it shows balances on accounts... no option to sort list differently... showing the oldest payments, open invoices on top... no option to change sorting methods... too many things to list...
president. love this app
. entered in info 2 link bank business card. then i went & made a purchase with that same card & nothing showed up. giving apps a shot, even though i know in the back of my mind that anything can be hacked. i'm not trying this again will uninstall.
worthy app, very user friendly !!. personally this app is unbelievable. it dose pretty much everything. however, it would be even better if you could set up folders in a name customer by you. second, it would be even better if you could access certain command requests without it buggingout. so far that has only happened once. otherwise it would have got five star.
. i wanted to subscribe this application. when i try to signup i got error i again try to signup got message this application is not available in india.
very useful application. it really helps me stay up to the minute with my business goings on.
not that good. only useful if you want to look something up quick as it is missing tons of features from the desktop site. will be using it no problem for a few minutes then it will log me out and ask for my password all over again.
great but could use a little more. overall pretty great. clean easy to do basic tasks, would love access to a few more advanced features...but overall it's a great app. the app is stable, love the fingerpint login (even though it's still a little buggy at time of writing the review), it's clean & easy to read, good navigation. overall i'm very happy with it!
can‚Äôt create pos in app. wish i could create pos in the app. we use qb online with shopify. i can only create a po to send to my distributor from my desktop. i am often away from my desktop, in order to send a p.o. from my phone i have to log on to the regular online edition through safari. i cannot use the app as i need it to function.
. desktop on line was great had to upgrade to the new online version ,total nightmare can't fined customer statements or customer credit notes etc. very few reports unfortunately have to use the online version due to the new digital vat rules or would just dump it. online chat is as much good as a chocolate teapot. there must be another accountancy package out there that we can transfer all our quickbooks data to. terrible
great for invoices. i use it mainly for invoicing.
amazing. it is a great app. so powerful i can do my full estimate and invoice and the best feature entering in my receipts for expenses and it's so easy!
application bug. depuis la mise a jours de ios 13 je ne suis plus capable de facturer mes clients . j‚Äôesp√®re qu‚Äôil va avoir un correctif rapidement merci
. so far total garbage app. i connected my app to my qb online account. i opened the app. snapped 3 receipts. camera worked well isolating the receipts. after that totally useless. despite a new tab appearing in my banking section online i cannot find the receipt copies in either the app or online. i really needed one to return a product. qb cs of no help.
great app with a few refinements needed. this app, together with quickbooks online, does everything my business needs it to do, almost. but that's just my business. this is a very sophisticated system but easy to use! love it
logs me off all the time. every single day this app automatically logs me out, displays a message that there‚Äôs been a critical update, and that i need to log in again. even worse it requires you to actually enter the password rather than allowing face id authentication.
. i like the apps easy access but it truly suck because nothing is accessable properly. writing an estimate or invoice on this app is not possible. not properly anyway. its really not pleasant either going online via cellphone because it zooms in and out improperly. its very frustrating. as for quickbooks via laptop i love it. quickbooks has truly made my life much easier and way more organized. but the app needs to be fixed and also online via cellphone bugs.
new update sucks. latest update for android takes forever to refresh and save invoices. almost unusable for me when i'm on the job. takes over five minutes to save an invoice and then even longer to print one if will will even let me...tried to uninstall and reinstall and reboot and everything it still takes way too long to refresh and save.
". not free as advertised. 30 day cinderella ware. fine, but they should clearly state that. i was impressed until after setup they informed me. my bad; l should know better. their advertising says it's good tho. uninstalled b4 review. ""while it isnt free"" it said it was free."
since ios 13 update not full screen. can believe this is the 5th update si ce then, and you can‚Äôt fix on iphone 11 pro full screen notch lack, we pay a lot monthly for this crap, so frustrating
. really easy to use
. does not work right for 3 months and still not fixed...yet they still charge as if it were working
ios 10.01 update...... awful! not user friendly. keeps telling me to update safari to use program. still can't run checks!
sorely disappointed. intuit made good products maybe even great products at one time. now their cloud offerings a just released with out any concern for features and bugs. disappointed. somebody has gotten to big to care about their customers.
amazing appsÔºÅ. so amazingÔºÅ
. ugly icon change it back to blue. the green doesn't go with the rest of the user interface. :
adding pdf. can not add pdf attachments. to my invoices. app is crashing. please fix this.
. i haven't done much with the app yet, but so far so good. it seemed difficult at first however; the more i used it, the easier it became
. 1720 update  i had used the mobile app for android for quite a long time with no issue and then approximately one month ago after an update the dashboard no longer has any information and is blank. i can still see activity but there's no way to get to customers or any of the other functions. i've emailed previously with no response. previous review: works well for viewing quickbooks info and taking payments
. great app
outdated. the iphone app is way better and has more features including hours and quantity in invoicing. this app really needs updating
great for business on the move. this app is a solid connection to your quickbooks and allows for quick and straightforward posting of expenses, invoices and estimates.
. i had to stop in the middle of resending an invoice, after i cant seem to find email resend edit option??:((( have to reenter all like new order, waste of time!!! does it accept international bankwire?
did you not test the latest update?. crashes on startup... please fix asap. i use this daily. this used to work great.
okay. this app would be perfect if it didn‚Äôt redirects me to safari to login every single time
great app. good for a non accounting person like me. i can keep track and give it all to my accountant and it gets done. i love that i can send invoices from my ipad and enter info etc. two thumbs up!
. quick books is a good app to manage your business.
quickbooks online. the application what ever so far developed is 55. (smooth, easy to use, great ui design). but there are many existing features missing between web and app. an by quickbooks online itself can have lot more basic features which is available in many other pos softwares to manage a firm. your updates are very minimal or nothing. developments are slow!! support team is reactions fast for the queries (just reacting) but no solution for problems or no concrete answers for new feature request.
. after new update app stuck on dashboard. unable to perform work on app. please fix this issue
. still lots for me to learn so cant say 5 out if 5
. i use the app to send and check on invoices. its a great way to do business out of the office. love it.
keeps getting more user friendly!. the new video tutorials make it easy to learn. the portability of switching between the mobile app and the desktop version online is a priceless feature, thanks for all of your hard work!
limited, buggy, slow... this a majorly limited version of quickbooks online. you really can't do much with it. it also crashes often and is extremely, painstakingly slow. but so is qb online for that matter.
. very miss leading and is nothink like the tv advert. not to easy to use and over all disappointed. having to use it because of my accountant. no impressed!!!! also no english call centre's! you can't understand the customer help line team as there english is poor. needs english call centres employing english to overcome this problem!!!!!
good for basics, missing key items for on the go. the app does the basics, but i typically run into issues getting exactly what i need. have to use the full online version for truly running the business
. it's a great apps. but we should have option to add vehicle expenses as kmml spent like self employed apps !!!!
easy to use.. does what i need it to do. helps me record my sales and expenses without a pc.
inaccurate balances from the program to my checking account. the app continues to have a different balance from my checking account. i have zeroed out the account several times and restarted but it continues to apply something incorrectly with the downloading of the account transactions.
for a guy who is running his own business this is gold!. love how easy it is to invoice and snap receipts on the go. tracks all my invoices so if those subcontractors don‚Äôt pay i‚Äôm onto them straight away! cheers for making it so easy!
great app. this is getting better with each update it makes. i you this app everyday to run my practice and it makes it very convenient because i'm constantly on the road and i don't have to sit at my desk just to enter expenses or send invoices to clients.
handy app.. i've struggled for a while with record keeping and this app makes it very easy to keep records and do my day to day book keeping.
. this is a very good way to keep track of it expenses and orders... i don't even know if another choice in this space!
works great. i just started using this for a small business and while i'm still figuring out a few of the functions for accounting, it's quite intuitive overall. it's a very useful piece of software.
crashes often. this app goes from being usable to worthless on a whim.
great app. there is no other app like it. this is probably one of the easiest apps to use and it is very userfriendly. i use it for my business and i have instant access on my iphone. you can send invoices on a moments notice.
bugs and bugs it a jungle. 1. kicking out of the app very often. 2. not able to email multiple invoices at one time. 3. limited search capabilities. cant search notes and description. :(
buyer beware crash instantly on iphone 6. this app works sometimes but it will instantly crash and doesn't operate properly on my iphone 6 running the latest iphone software. i tried removing and reinstalling but it still doesn't work properly. why don't you guys fix this? also, it annoyingly downloads company info every time you open it which takes what seems like hours. i have a very small landscape business. should this be the case? come on intuit! get your act together
nice, but not as good as it could be. great for staying on top of purchases. but, it's too cumbersome to move around within the app efficiently. needs to have the ability to post deposits and merchandise returnscredits from within the app.
i love this app. small business owners dream, easy to use, inexpensive, web based....awesome on the go
. great app
. i use this app while i had my quickbooks trial, and it seemed to be working fine. the minute i subscribed, the app stopped working properly. i emailed support, no one seems to be answering my questions, and when i phone the customer service, they don't know how to help with the app. i'm stuck and ready to cancel the whole thing.
easy. i use it to view the position rather than a tool to raise invoices etc, a nice addon
app not working since update. normally i'd give the app 45 stars but every time i log in now it says sign in successful but there is no online account associated with the email and to start a free trial. however when i login from safari, i get in no problem. please fix as i am unable to access data from my phone.
. good experience
great app. great for when you're on the go
owner. this application and online service is the best i have ever used. it keeps me up to date with all book keeping. the reports it provide makes doing taxes a synch. the only thing i haven't mastered is tracking all jobs separately. if i can get this program to give me a report identifying what the profit was on each job that would help tremendously. i am fairly a new user about 2 years off and on. other than that, i give this app
i can't stand this program. logins don't work most of the time. functionality is severely limited (no expense tracking, no bill entry?! seriously). crashes regularly. horrible customer service.
bugs and features not working. there is a lot of potential here but also problems. our accountant would like us to use this software yet some of the features don‚Äôt work on the mobile app and even on the website there are still many bugs. the biggest is only a few of the accounts created in chart of accounts are available. most are not available in the app and even on the website are ‚Äúgreyed out‚Äù and off limits.
newest update ruins app. after updating my app touch id no longer works and i can't receive payments and clear invoices anymore also it makes me sign in every time i open the app , before this update the app worked perfect and deserved a 5 star rating , you have ruined it and made it unusable , you need to fix this.
no american express support. we use american express for expenses and we cannot manage these transactions within the app. not even see them. the app tells me to view quickbooks online in a web browser to manage amex transactions. this makes this app very useless.
. app stops working constantly. mixes up info on invoice and has even added up invoice totals wrong. update getting worse and nothing is being done to fix. have asked for help and get none. i have invoices that have disappeared off the app!? to quick books stop the b.s. and supoort your app.
. perfect! never have an issue & do not plan ever going to a different kind of software.
great program. it's so easy to use, i love it.
problem with update please fix. iphone x, after updating the app, it doesn‚Äôt let me edit any transactions at all, i can only approve what is recognized transaction, an unrecognized transaction is not responsive to touchscreen commands so i have to cancel edit. please fix
love quickbooks app. very easy to use definitely recommend
would recommend to everyone!. easily the best software to manage a small business. i am able to invoice customers with such ease that it makes me wonder why i haven't switched software platforms sooner! you can not go wrong with quickbooks. the app is so easy to navigate.
director. nice and simple. can be figured out by anyone.
. worse app ever, doesn't let you view your receipts through phone. useless for my business. biggest waste of money i have spent so far.
great app!!. no issues so far. simple to use.
can't create po's through app. i use quickbooks for 2 things mainly. to create estimatesinvoices and send pos once the invoice has been paid. i can't create po's with the app so it's useless. i have to go to the website every time i want to create a po. it makes no sense that they would leave this feature out.
. quickbooks has allowed me to continue with my business by taking care of all of the administrative work for my business. thank you quickbooks
. this app doesn't allow me to sign in, so it's been useless.
. superb just need to upgrade to a better version..
useless. useless for monitoring company. need access to pl and other data
love it. love the app, really intuitive!!! and great customer service!!!
works wonderfully. the functions now work wonderfully i just wish i could add project dates to the invoices and have them reflected in the google calendar.
bugs and features not working. there is a lot of potential here but also problems. our accountant would like us to use this software yet some of the features don‚Äôt work on the mobile app and even on the website there are still many bugs. the biggest is only a few of the accounts created in chart of accounts are available. most are not available in the app and even on the website are ‚Äúgreyed out‚Äù and off limits.
. app is so slow and doesn't have the functionality of the full web version making it pretty useless
if you don‚Äôt use quickbooks you‚Äôre probably wasting a lot of time.. i find the day to day management of my business much easier and less time consuming since i started using quick books. as with everything, it isn‚Äôt perfect. i would like to see more features on the mobile app. that being said, i only use the app and it works well for me. customer service is excellent. they strive to resolve any issue you throw at them. i would highly recommend!
. mostly good. i have accidentally send invoices before they are ready.
. lacks functionality and still cannot access by bank account to reconcile. cannot recommend this app. avoid.
. great program
easy. great app just what i need as a digital nomad.
all that you need at the same app. great app, easy to navigate
appreciated. great app, looking forward for same features as of website!
so efficient. qbo is so easy to use. any query i have, the support team always responds within a couple of hours and the way they explain things is in a way that is so easy to understand, and they are just so helpful.i always recommend qbo to anyone that asks what software i use.
not worth it. just a trial...................
. the app use to work fine but since last month i can not update any invoice in the app. it keep givig me error unable to edit. there was adding this invoice. if this problem continues please call customer care. i have uninstalled and installed saveral time no luck.
app is changed for the worse. i am not sure when this happened, but the app is now useless and does not have the functionality it used to have. i now need to do everything on computer. not good.
great app. good for a non accounting person like me. i can keep track and give it all to my accountant and it gets done. i love that i can send invoices from my ipad and enter info etc. two thumbs up!
where's my payroll!. i can wait to do revenue and expense entries until i get back from vacation but i need to be able to pay my employees. useless without it.
i love it!. easy to use too. great for generating invoices quickly
needs tip option. please add tip option when customer signs credit card transaction like in go payment
limiting. very limited app
top notch app for businesses. makes it so easy to run my business on the go!!!!
. great app, love throwing away receipts just take a picture of the expense, document it, and bam, you're done.
. great program for everyday needs of running our landscaping business
last version have a lot of issues. since i got the last update, the app crashes a lot and its very slow!!
"best app tool for small business. i love everything about it. just please change when emailing estimate, remove ""please pay"" and change to total estimate as it is only estimate and not an invoice."
. quick books online has allowed us to generate invoices on the spot contributing to much quicker payments than we have been used to
no activity?. none of my vendors have any activity (transactions) available within this app. almost rendering it completely useless in our business.
. love that there is the mileage and receipt tracker now. i was disappointed when there was an entirely separate app and to see these added has made me very happy
really good, but.... the app does everything i need it to, but the fact that it doesn't show up in the recent apps list makes it unusable for me. i like to copy paste from a emails, and receipts into the app, so not being able to quickly switch back to it from another app sucks. fix that and likely a 5 star.
quick books. very useful and excellent application
where are the invoices??. what is the point of an accounting app that does not show supplier invoices? dreadful. support was as helpful as a chocolate teapot too ...
so. slow.. this app functions ok, i guess but it runs so slow! taking a receipt picture to enter an expense, for example, should be a quick and easy fast but the app moves so slow and it takes too many taps to complete such a simple task.
. good app, simple and yet very decent would give 5 stars but the hardware android menu button doesn't do anything. set it to open that side bar, also it needs a speed increase. sometimes it takes over 40 seconds to update. otherwise great app, easy to use. eagerly await updates to this.
president. i‚Äôm busy right now trying to invoice, from customer service to user friendly software qb is on point for the business man. love the service for sure.
easy to use, powerful, accessible and secure.. i've been using it for 2 years and it's been great.
. this is no longer working at all for me. i can't even log in. it was working fine until this weekend. something has changed. intuit need to fix this.
"great app for distributors. we can invoice and deliver on the fly without having to go back to the office to capture the ""in the moment sales"". our accountant has access and was able to set our account up to match his categories for a fast and no worry tax prep."
worthless. qbo is great, but this mobile app stinks.. worthless. hopefully they can evolve this app quickly. qbo is great but this app ain't
not good.. application works well on my iphone , won't work at all on my nexus 6p? won't open at all. send several notes to developers and nothing yet needs a update
meh.... looks great, but has so few features that's it's just not that useful.
impressive for mobile. i posted a bad review because of some bugs. i received an immediate response about upcoming updates and a week later it was fixed. i love that level of support. nice app too.
doesn‚Äôt work on ios13. hoping for another update as it doesn‚Äôt work on ios13
. rubbish app as never let's me update my bank transactions. i go to refresh and it simply comes up saying none and all up to date when it's not. makes the app unusable for me.
best in the business!. im a general contractor, tracking and allocating expenses is easy, i take a picture of the receipts with my phone and stays stored in the cloud, really cool. i like it a lot
game changer. totally transformed my business. really great software, so informative and nice community to support you. no brainer. can't believe i'm raving about accountancy software!
professional and practical. love this app! makes my business paperwork so much easier!
do not buy. while i think this could be a good product, the app ruins it. i have both the base and the arm. the app crashes every time i use them. at times it takes 3 tries to get them to finish reading. terrible product!
ios 9 broke it. ios 9 broke the app and now every time it's trying to download company data just crashes. uninstalled and reinstalled. also wish you could accept transactions on this.
. i love the freedom that qbook gives me with the online version i can work at any place out side of the office.. also update are free and there free support team are the best. thanks so much qbook for be there for my business and me..
useless. invoices won't save please fix
app crashes constantly. i used to love this app. the last couple of months the app crashes daily and multiple times. i‚Äôm in the middle of working and the app says critical updates are needed and logs me out. i‚Äôm extremely frustrated with this considering i pay over $20month to use this software across all my devices.
. please add support for whattsup business app
bugs!. so many bugs with this! i just rated it before and it‚Äôs popped up again asking me to rate. and i could go into so much more, however i‚Äôm only using this until next year. it‚Äôs shocking. i have just sent 3 invoices, the clients have received them, but they are not showing up in the app.
. saves hours of time linking with the bank account , quick and easy once you have the hang of it
great app!. one of the best apps i have used!
quickbooks. it's great for making estimatesinvoices tracking inventory. .only problem i have found is it prints out like a letter that could be a setting i have missed, would like for the print out to actually look like a billinvoice
slow to respond from time to time .. the app is sometimes slow to respond.
. make my work lot easier and faster
. great app very user friendly. the mobile app is still a bit limited as i cant do statements from it but once on the laptop everything can be done
. i haven't been able to use this app for a really long time, all the sudden it doesn't save my login details anymore, hard to login, once i logged in and try to go next step, it logged me out and says tempary not available. super annoying!!
. app is not working after the recent update, i am not able to login. it's simply goes blank after tapping the qb icon
owner. does great. especially when i'm in the field.
simple. simple easy to use, love the phone app.
three years using qbo. very dissatisfied.. bugs and more bugs. slow and clunky functionality. bait and switch pricing. no way to communicate effectively with qbo as they are pro forma all about feedback and customer service however the poor souls tasked with providing it have no two way communication with the people who actually code this bug ridden system. i am actively looking for other solutions that provide ipad and iphone data entry.
"disappointing. if you also make ""mint"", why make your subscription service app so much worse? mint is great. this app is not."
. haven't dug deep into the options available, but thus far my experience has been very good.
getting better with every upgrade.. great app. they do lure you with the free use then hit ya with the charges later. i think it's a useful tool in the toolbox.
great small business tool. excellent on a laptop, dient handel banks with authentication dongles very well, mobile app doesn't handle them at all. can't do payroll from mobile. receipt tracking is easy and works well. reports and snap shots handy.
. there was supposed to be a 30day free trial and they charged me anyway this app is not recommended.
my best weapon !! mi mejor arma !!. i own a landscape company, we do lots of renovations and i love to take pictures before & after and attach them to the invoices !! soy due√±o de una compa√±√≠a de jardiner√≠a, hacemos un mont√≥n de renovaciones y me encanta tomar fotograf√≠as antes y despu√©s de que se adjuntar√°n a las facturas!
useless. the app keeps crashing, if you‚Äôre in the middle of typing a long estimate or creating an invoice, it crashes and your file is gone, you have to keep saving your project, otherwise when it crashes, your project is gone. very disappointed, going to a different app or software at the beginning of the year, three years with this crap, paying high monthly rates, and for nothing.
great. great app i use it everyday, makes invoices a breeze and makes it easier at the end of the year for tax purposes.
awesome app. great app to compliment the web based quickbooks program, made my accounting tracking and hassles a thing of the past.
love it!!!. this app makes things so easy to keep track of a job while in the field and saves time. love it!!!!
. makes sending and tracking invoices simple.
. u need to put the all app in full.
. 1 star due to being conned by the sales staff. downloaded app and was offered 50% reduction if i signed up. next day get a call from quickbooks sales team saying they could offer the price lower for 12 months, signed up and looked at the offer on the app was lower. its a good tool but sales obv just want to meet their targets
. note 4 crashes
. extremely user friendly. easy to navigate and syncing with desktop is seamless.
. expenses can be duplicated if the save button is pressed more than one time.
. absolutely unless on android. it does not show the right invoices overdue only a select few and shows completely different things and different sums of money on iphone compared to android phone, in fact its completely different on all platforms i.e tablet android, ipad, pc windows and iphone.
won't allow adding services to invoice. i called tech support because i could not create an invoice for a customer. they had me uninstall & reinstall qbo app. it still wouldn't work. he said they're aware of the problem. it's still not fixed a week later.
app crashing multiple devices (ios 10 & ios 11). i use this app for my business and after the last update the app has been completely useless on my ipad and on my phone. the only way i can log data is by sitting at my computer when i get home from work. please fix asap. using freshbooks until then. thanks.
takes some learning. once you get the ins and outs of it the system is amazing!!!!!
love it. i'm no doing anything super sophisticated but i love the app. easy to use to keep invoices and expenses current on the go!
. absolutely love it because i can enter transactions in my books anywhere. it's very convenient.
. perfect app for my realty estate business.
. the app does everything i need it to and more.
easy to use. excellent app. very straight forward to use. the only issue i have is not been able to raise purchase orders on the app. this is very important to me because of the nature of my business, other than that it's spot on.
quick books. great app
good apps. its a excelent, but in 1 mounth are problem to connect in sometimes!! for all is good!
. quickbooks online has been great, downloaded this app to make life quicker when not in the office. however, for expenses i have found it unusable as the same payment methods i am using online are not available on the app and therefore it messes up the consistency of my transactions. very disappointed as had high hopes, have yet to test the differences whilst invoicing.
. very well designed usee experience üëçüèª!
poor. this app makes very poor use of the screen real estate of phablet style phones and even worse on ipads. they also removed the comma from the keyboard, so adding additional email addresses to a customer is impossible. generally a poor design, this app is years behind where i should be.
great but.... very great app. i rated three stars because you can‚Äôt enter employee time from your mobile device. i know it‚Äôs a mobile app but you should be able to enter time . i understand that mobile apps are a little different but this seems like a simple task that should be possible. i send invoices and estimates all the time with the mobile app other than that it‚Äôs a great app. will update rating when these features are added
great software all round. quickbooks is easy to use and manage. software and app work easily together. makes small businesses life simpler. love being able to use app to do expenses and invoicing on the go.
. works pretty well. would be nice if you could customize invoices.
mr.. brilliant program, cost efficient and very accessible.
awesome. this app is so good i'm so glad i have it i would be lost with out it
statements!. please add the ability to send a statement(s) from the mobile app. thank you!
design and functionality is poor. the pin code doesn't work. i have to refresh data most of the time. crashes a few times a week. trying to edit description or client info is a pain. here is another update ok the app. it says clients have paid invoice on my phone when they haven't app is frustrating to work with.
syncs to everything!!. awesome app. i'm using quickbooks for my personal accounting. saves a ton of time. intuit's phone and online support is terrific as well. couldn't recommend this app highly enough.
cannot input supplier invoices you have to upgrade. bought quickbooks for our subsidiary business, input invoices, pay suppliers etc to find out you can‚Äôt actually input supplier invoices unless you upgrade! so from ¬£11.99 a month to ¬£18.99 a month just to input purchase, very odd
great program. i love quickbooks. i run payroll and create estimates, invoices and sales receipts. i am able to link all my accounts even my square account easily and seamlessly. the customer service representatives are competent and friendly.
contractor couldn't live without it. i use this app every time i bill a client and can provide him with an accurate, complete invoice and receive payment on the spot. importing customers from my contacts is a great help. a musthave complement to quickbooks online.
no chart of accounts or banking. poor version. no access to chart of accounts, registers, or online banking.
. great software. do your bookkeeping from anywhere. covers all the bases. if the customer asks for an invoice, send it to them while you are standing there talking to them. then have them pay right from your smartphone. no more excuses.
love quickbooks app!!!. great app. allows me to conduct business while on the road when computer access it not possible.
. after new update app stuck on dashboard. unable to perform work on app. please fix this issue
in sync. i would give it a 5 if the ipad and android versions were synced faster and had the same features.
convenient. i upgraded to quickbooks online after some computer problems. it is so comforting to know i can access my information from several devices and the transition went smoothly.
so easy!. keeping my books and budget up to date is so simple now. no more hurriedly scratched reminder notes that end up getting lost or having to wait to update my registers. great app!
quick access. great app on the go.
. improve ur app i clear all my data buy in app its still coming
love it. makes it easy to keep tracking of eveything. as a business owner, operator it gets hard to sit down in front of a computer, with this i can do my invoices on the go!
i rely on online sync with my external banks. i'm disappointed the subscription i pay for is not mobile. i imagine it would take a lot of programming to include sync on mobile tablets but if it's already hosted on the server, why no access? i'm not a architect but i imagine outsourcing the sync hardware off the tablet you could get your current transactions on mobile . maybe i'm crazy
offline mode. i wish i could enter transactions without an internet connection. then they would synch after the device reconnects.
. the best they have really improved on the app. definitely worth the money.
clumsy, slow, crashes often. not a great app, times out saving transactions, sometimes saves them, sometimes not. not worth the money
easier than all other apps. i literally tried out a dozen other apps trying to get one free or cheap. efforts were futile. i broke down and bought this one and never happier. it works like a charm and no dead buttons. does what i want it to do and no limitations.
great app. great app links well details on the laptop. can create invoices on as soon as the job is finished.
an entire office mgmt team in one app. quickbooks literally took me from a life of getting to work at 7:00 a.m. and eventually falling asleep in my chair in front of the computer try to keep up with invoices and tax documents. for 3 months this went on and now about 20 minutes after work and the rest of the night is mine to enjoy. thank you immensely.
. so far this app is working very well for me and i have not had any problems as of yet
login will not allow me to paste my password. i use quickbooks online, so i use a very strong password that is stored in an app (1password). it would be extremely annoying to hand type a 25 character random password into this app. and i'm unwilling to compromise my security for my online financial data. therefore this app is totally useless to me.
great app. i am enjoying staying on top of things while on the go.
stuck in the test version. it is all great in theory, yet there are so many glitches. you can‚Äôt search by address. it crashes too often. frequent notifications that as an example your deposits weren‚Äôt recorded properly do you want to fix them? i shouldn‚Äôt need to fix the bank deposits. please fix the bugs! oh and not all of my clients made the transition from the desktop version to the online version. also quickbooks asked me to rate quickbooks online 4 times today alone.
great app... needs some work.. there‚Äôs no way to record a sale without attaching a customer to it. also, there‚Äôs really not a place in the app to keep a ledger. if it had these 2 things, it would get 5 stars from me, but as it stands i give it 4.
doesnt seem to work on lg g4. cant even log in to the app.raised it with quickbooks support over a month and we still cant seem to get it working
highly recommend. as an accountant, i use quickbooks everyday on a variety of clients. i wouldn‚Äôt recommend any other software. the cloud based platform is ideal for ease of access and management.
crashes 3 seconds after opening. latest version is completely unusable on both iphone and ipad. crashes 3 seconds after opening. both on iphone and ipad. did anyone actually test this?
great app and fair prices. i do all my business through quick books and have had no major problems. the rates on credit transactions are equivalent to any other clearing house and at $30 a month to automate my process is a life saver. great simple to read reports too.
. slow and buggy with a moto x4. a turd of an app.
. such an amazing app for storing all your business expenses.it's very convenient and easy to use.those who have difficulty in managing their business transactions should definitely go for this app.
nice app. this is a really good app and i would give it five stars except i keep getting an error message when opening up certain accounts from the chart of accounts.
love the mobile app. they have made huge improvements to the mobile app. i don't have to access my desktop version as much. has greatly improved my ability to send invoices to customers in the fly. has decreased waiting for payments of invoices dramatically.
. i've been using qb online for almost three years now. its a great platform for small business's but its constantly having glitches and crashing. i really wish they could fix this. other then the glitches its great.
. maybe it's my phone but the app runs incredible slow!
good start but need improvement. good to have a mobile app but many features missing: > take pic of receipts > journal entry > make deposit to mention a few.
". refreshing bank transactions doesn't work. after refresh and upade still say "" ! error 22 days ago"". causes double entry after entering expenses manually by no refreshing and posting them. doesn't refresh bank data."
great idea, but not full version. as a longterm user, i expected more from the app than it has. i still have to use my pc for some of the essential functions such as payables, reports, and payroll. disappointed!
where the banking. i want to accept transactions while i sit in bed, this app is far from useful without that capability, come on intuit, make the app complete. as is, a total let down!
ability to do transfers. good app just wish i could do transfers between my bank accounts the same as the online version.
. love the new update. need mobile po creation now please.
broken update. your update broke the app.
now works with ios13. just updated ios 13 app appears to be working on ios13.
forced payroll system not working. since march 2017 our payroll that they force you to pay for if you have employees has not working correctly. edd efile is non existent, cannot archive reports, and irs efile is sporadic. customer service wont credit any amount nor can they fix the problem even after ‚Äúescalating‚Äù it to priority customer support. three ‚Äúcases‚Äù opened, none of which fixed the problem. do not buy this product.
alcatel one touch. great app for small business.
. amazing app
review. love quick books but feel very much alone when it comes to new stuff or thinks i need help with it would seem to me that qb think that everyone as the same knowledge level as they do and a diary like the original one with barclays bank would be very useful
. this app sucks. it has stopped working and often displays incorrect information. it's super annoying. only the desktop works.
this app makes being a business owner much more enjoyable. to be able to keep track of finances, outgoing & ongoing charges made all the difference for my small business.
. the worst!!!! i switched to a new phone and now it doesn't recognize my user name and password. it even allowed me to change the password and then wouldn't recognize the new one. called twice to resolve the problem. first time, 35 minute wait and hung up. 2nd time 40 minute wait, hung up. i will be canceling my subscription and looking for a quality competitor who values customer service. what a shame!
mobility at its best!. is like having your business at the palm of your hands! just sent out a $40k invoice while on a cruise ship in mexico. also love the storeforward function. no need to be connected, once you get connected it will be sent out. great app!
. this app is useless and doesn't work properly on a phone
ouch. does not have my bank listed. does me no good. been paying for 1 year now. and i see no where how to stop subscribing. cost me over $10.00 a month.
. love it, it makes my life easier.
would be better if i could manage payroll on the app. i would love to be able to do up my company‚Äôs payroll on the fly if i‚Äôm out on a job site or on a business trip. please fix this
no major complaints thus far. pretty convenient to do on the phone. i guess it's worth the subscription fee.
horrible. can't stand the program or customer support
. great app.
easy and super user friendly. first time user of this type of app but it was easy to set up. sent out my first invoice after 1hr already.
. i am a quickbooks proadvisor. i started qbo and am getting used to it. the mobile app has really improved! thanks intuit. always love how you really care about what we experience.
many bugs. need to fix bugs that cause the app to not follow the regular online access. employees can see things they shouldn't (like business income) and are unable to do things they should like entering customer info and invoices.
great app for busy employersemployees. your features are reduced and it's not the exact same as when you use a pc but it is still really nice. i would not be want it to be as in depth anyways it's nice and simple. i would recommend it to anybody that needs quickbooks on the go. we do a lot of work in the field and it is really nice to do estimates and email them to the customer while standing right next to them.
. tried to use it to review transactions, banking section is permanently glitched and won't load transactions or activity.
doesn't work, won't use it. it continually crashes upon start up and log in attempt but i'm not desperate to find out why.
no purchase order function!?. had to edit comment because the replier only read the title and not the content. cannot place pos with vendors. can only add expenses but can't place pos with vendors...
. great way to manage my business remotely. easy to use. great app!
. great app!
. with a little creative googling this app can be very easy to implement.
fmtt. i like quickbooks especially the app. however, reconciliation is difficult and confusing. also, matching. deposits and making sure deposits are made in quickbooks is so hard to figure out.
adding products to invoices. very time consuming to write any invoice on the iphone. each item must be added individually unlike on the ipad app you can multiselect items in the product search.
. app is not working in india
. simple to use and powerful tool
. bad app does not sign in after sign up
now i don't need to use my desktop anymore. i use my phone for everything like checking emails and surfing the web etc. the only time i would use my desktop was to create invoices. well those days are over thanks to this app
fantastic for when you‚Äôre on the move. this app has really helped me operate more efficiently from a mobile office. the ability to quickly and easily produce quotes and invoices from my ipad has been extremely useful. the app isn‚Äôt as fully featured as its desktop counterpart but it does enough to suit my needs, whilst i‚Äôm on the move. i‚Äôm running this app on a 10.5 ipad pro and it has been flawless.
. excellent app
. update has not fixed this issue! why can't i see bank account details in the app? you can on the ios app contacted help desk who couldn't help! without access to accounts the app is effectively useless. i have done everything you suggest. home screen is now blank! so even worse than when i started. i have also contacted support with no solution as yet.
way too limited. the app for the ipad is too basic. i can create an invoice and email or print but if i need to print an existing invoice there is no option to do this. after receiving payments there is no way to deposit them to my bank. i can't believe that qb would release an app before testing it. i am hoping that there will be an upgrade soon to make it functional. disappointed!
awesome!!!. fantastic and love how much this program does for you. very simple to use.
. great. great app. makes life easier.
really2 great application. i wish i have found this software 8 years back and it can help me save thousand spent on trying many other software
. f√°cil de usar, excelente para los que los que trabajamos por fuera
great tool. this app helps me keep track of my business finances and at the click of a button i can see who owes me money or who i owe money to. really useful!!
good software. this software is very awesome. i work for the company but also use it for my own personal budgeting and it is extremely helpful but there are still a lot of bugs that need to be worked out with this app so that all the information updates correctly.
mr. great app. i use it all the time on my phone and tablet.it works seamlessly with qbo. invoicing, receipts, checking my account, giving it to my bookeeper all easy and on the go. i couldn't do without it now.
binoy. easy to use interface love the app
ok but struggles on ipad pro. what the app does it does well but it doesn‚Äôt do payroll as well as some other features. logging in to the website on my ipad pro isn‚Äôt much better.
gret app. i love this app but the reason i didn't give it a 5 is because when you enter an expense with the app and write who you paid and save the expense when you go to the computer it does not show who you paid. that field is blank.
. best app for tracking my personal expenses easily.
app has connectivity issues. anytime i log into the app it causes me to have to relink my bank accounts every time. if i stay out of the app everything works appropriately. i can log onto different devices through the browsers without issue but the second i log onto the app on a tablet or phone, it will disconnect my bank accounts.
ceo. this is a really good app it has help our business in so many ways. it help boost our profit margin we have been able to close deals, and make invoices right on the spot. i recommend this for a lot of different business with quickbooks online.
can‚Äôt enter bills. totally useless
unusable.. i'm required by my work to use this appwebsite, and it is completely unusable. after confirming my account via email and twice by text message i get an error message when i try to login. the website also does not function no matter what browser i use on my phone. what a joke.
. extremely slow. no it not slow wifi no it's not the device note 10 it's just a slow app
needs work. this app has a lot of functionality, but lacks consistancy with the web version. as it is today, i can't send an invoice from this app which looks the same as i send from the web version. if what the customer sees becomes consistant i could give more stars.
glitchy software loses emails really crappy support. issues remain for years intuit does not fix. loses emails all the time invoices say sent when they are not.
better than sage. so i've been using sage for about a year now and decided to switch to quickbooks. best decision ever. quickbooks is much more simple. totally recommend it.
awesome app!. great software, well written and updated regularly, moves seamlessly between phone ipad and desktop
. this app is only a trial version... i downloaded it because i thought it'd be free. talk about click bait!!! smh
. errors on free trail. can generate a invoice or put the company name on. i try my phone, tablet and laptop. keep on saying the same thing. error on tax .........
no app support for time activity. come on quickbooks! no time activity entry in the app?! ridiculous!
after 3 years qb stops working. spent hours on the phone with support. no solution. cannot add items to an invoice. i'm a distributor so mobile is pretty important. sorry qb pretty disappointed with your product.
impressed.. very impressed with how far intuit has taken the qb online product, and this app is a nice extension of that! all the talk of cloud and mobile being the future..is now thanks to this cloud product. i refer many accountants in my network the qbo accountant version, which is the best solution for most small businesses in my opinion.
. solid a love the mobility and ease of use for my small business. just wish i could void or cancel invoices and estimates on the app.
why use the app when you it lacks the features of the website. you can‚Äôt change the status of in invoice on the app and must be done online only. this is a major flaw in the app. once i do my taxes i will no longer be using quick books, because of the enforced complexity the system is rendered mostly useless. the app needs to have complete functionality of the site.
amazing customer service. i have needed assistance twice this last month in redesigning my invoices. both the agents that helped me truly seemed more like friends then a rep. both were very knowledgeable, patient and extremely helpful. now i am actually enjoying my quickbooks instead of grumbling every time i use it. happy customer, karen velasquez, owner of see through services
. like a bookeeper without the paycheck expense
. amazing value for money, i've successfully filed my accounts from using this app!
quick books online is awesome. this app and online software allows you to send estimates that customers can approve electronically then after its approved and the work is done the same estimate transitions into an invoice at the push of a button. after the customer pays, that information can be easily stored for tax purposes. awesome!
. quickbooks it's been awesome for my business. i can send estimates and get all my receipts taking care at one app. i highly recommend quickbooks to anyone who has a business.
great app. i use this everyday! wouldn't want any other invoicing company
. half the time things don't work and some people can't pay their invoices. keeps loading the page. looking for a better payment processing company. i pay over $4900 yearly for fees and $12 monthly. just not worth it.
love it. they fixed the errors i was having. great app now.
ios 11 glitch. hi. since i upgraded to ios 11 the qb app does not allow me to do split transactions. this is a major glitch for me as most transactions are split. please can you get on to this as soon as possible. as a user of intuit software for nearly 20 years i know you'll fix this. thanks for great software.
. login with google sign on sends me out to my browser then asks for password creation. continuous loop back to app then back to browser. have not been able to log in once. followed directions online for help still unable to sign in. no other app does this. guess im stuck using my desktop for quickbooks. may have to look into an alternative.
. worst app ever
. crashes every time. hasn't opened successfully once. tried reinstalling and restarting tablet.
. if you even subscribe to their free trial, they will call you dozens of times in a day. its too much. every time a new number, so i can't get rid off. heavy spamming. ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§®‡§æ ‡§π‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§∞‡§ñ‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§§‡•Å‡§Æ ‡§≤‡•ã‡§ó‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§®‡•á
new receipt identification is much worse. the new version of the identification of receipts when taking a picture to upload to an expense is much much worse than the previous implementation. this version hasn‚Äôt worked accurately once in 30+ pictures, whereas the old version worked accurately 90%+ of the time. how does this stuff get through testing...? :
. this is app is so convenient! love it!
app is almost useless for me.. the only reason i upgraded to quickbooks on line was so that i could do estimates and invoicing on site. this app will allow me to do an estimate but will not let me do a partial invoice. if i can‚Äôt do a partial invoice on the app it‚Äôs simply a waste of time for my small fencing business.
. it's a great apps. but we should have option to add vehicle expenses as kmml spent like self employed apps !!!!
. love this app. making work so much easier. & reminds me of what needs paying & when someone hasn't paid. making the company alot more up to date & finally in the 21st century!
. doesn't have my back in its list, so it's useless. i've cancelled my subscription. when i contacted support, they were obsessed with my subscription, rather than the actual issue.
. login issue verification code sending is very slow and sometimes not.
love it!. so simple to use‚Ä¶ i absolutely love this app!
je. i would like to see journal entry feature added to the mobile app. i use this app as well as the online version for all of my clients. it would be nice to be able to perform all of the same functions no matter which i choose to use.
needs lots of work. very hard to use app. many options are hidden or unavailable so you are stuck and wind up doing the work through a browser instead
. awesome app makes invoicing and tracking payments easy
. great app makes things easier
. quickbooks online is awesome and is super valuable for my business, i am not one to recommend, but it saves me hours and i recommend it to everyone. the desktop program is great that i download for my pc, it has all the same useful features as the online platform. the apps are not the same. they are missing a lot of the features, and frankly useless. i typically just login through the browser with my android tablet and iphone....sorry just the truth!
i love it. it is a great app and program for me i have a catering co. and it works great for what i do i am on the road all the time and it never fails. it always works with ease
pretty good 9 months in. really good, can't do pay roll or vat reports on the app but just about everything else. photo receipts for expenses and checking received payments. very useful. f
. good app
awesome for small business. couple problems creating invoices from phone.
program not working. i pay itunes for subscription. i pay directly to them and my program is not accessible to me because it says is expired. i make a case with them 1 mouth ago. create another case 2 days ago. and still i am not able to use the program. payed buy me 2 times (direct to them and itunes). do not use this program you will regret like me.
partial funcionality. useless for my business, i have to do my accouting work on a computer, this app doesnt have what i need
cis. 3 stars given because i can barely use the app to submit cis invoices as i have to use the webpage version which does not work very well at all on a mobile interface
best business app!!!. i love using qb for my small business. love the auto reconciliation. professional looking quotes and invoices. it's amazing!!!!
horrible (the website version too). so obviously not developed or supported by anyone with any accounting knowledge as this is the least functional program i have ever seen.
love it. best app ever
excellent and easy to use. fantastic app would recommend it to anyone that asks
". often doesn't work. customer service tells me not to use the app, to access account from web browser. the numbers you get there may be undependable. don't trust it. the browser doesn't work with the phone. there only reason for quickbooks online is access while away from the computer. i often get the message,""check back in a few hours"". isn't that great when standing in front of a customer trying to write an invoice."
. best cloud based accounting software
. great program and very user friendly
. this app is like having my own accountant
roofing company. the app is great, although it needs an update with bugs fixed. the app won't allow me to modify, save or send invoices. very frustrating.
simplifies. this app makes it really easy and fast to manage receipts and expenses.
. there is a error when trying to add item, i have sent message to support with no reply, as well as requested input from the community. i guess you can't ask for much help with such small fees per month.
always improving. qbo isn't perfect but it is always improving. this week's update included features for accountants to track their client's pending work, communicate questions and request documents. this is good stuff!
step in the right direction. took intuit quite a while to develop this product. glad to see that they made something for the ipad. this however is still very limited as far as employees, printing check, payroll things like that. but it's a step in the right direction. keep working on it!
. the app was good until the free teial was up. i tried to subscribe but it wouldnt go through.. i uninstalled and reinstalled and lost everything and it still wouldnt work!!!!
. good app works good it saves allot of time, go payment should be integrated into the app
. my wife has this app and it works well for her business. i got this app based on her recommendation but unfortunately it has been full of technical difficulties. several hours wasted on talking to tech support and was told the tech team might resolve issues in a week. all details of my invoices are erased and wrong dates are shown on all invoices amongst other problems. wish they could solve this faster, has been very stressful experience so far for me.
glaring omissions. this would be a decent app if it could do the very basics of the online version, but it can' track mileage or track hours. why?????
difficulty downloading. i have used the application for years, but the whole system has trouble downloading new activity. very frustrating.
worthless. some functions don't work at all like banking. doesn't load account activity. it's so useless i have to use mobile web version.
. super slow load time and sms verification not working. it's a joke.
. exellent best app ever !!! easy to use
incomplete. the mobile app is not very useful compared to the online version, missing so many functions! like time sheets and billing be with them!
excellent app. this app is amazing, makes my life so easy and customer service is very helpful.. will definitely recommend. just one thing that needs working on, app does not sync with my barclays bank account so i have to export statements manually and upload to app, otherwise 5 star from me.
works great. works great for my small business. not sure why there are bad reviews, qbo keeps up with my customers information, invoices, and estimates. very easy to use. now on this last update, i did have to uninstall and reinstall on my andriod phone, but within 5 minutes i was back up and running.
. my issue has been partially resolved. i would give them 4 stars if the process wasn't so difficult.
jireh landscaping. great!! great program and app!!
great flexibility. love being able to do estimates and invoices on the go.
use it to view only. very handy to look at information. do not use it to enter information.
. cannot login from mobile
. cant use this app point, wont allow me to attach my business bank account to it.
app not working  version 4.3.3. app not able to connect. consistently showing ‚Äòtemporary unavailable'
useless app. mileage tracking is grossly inaccurate, way too many inadequacies and limitations on the invoicing and accounting features. this app is a joke. i tried it for several months and have lost money as a result of it's shortcomings. the positive reviews here must be fake. do your research and search the web for accurate reviews. i recommend everlance as a better option.
. great app.
so helpful. i love this app seriously. it's organized my work flow life so much!
efficient app. as a bookkeeper i use qbo for all of my clients as well as for my personal account. it just keeps getting better and better. accepting transactions is a breeze as is setting up invoices, paying bills, and writing estimates. one feature my clients find helpful is the receipt attachment. i would highly recommend this app for anyone who uses qbo.
. ne fonctionne plus depuis hier
easy to use. maybe better than the desktop app...
nice but not quite 5 stars. this is a handy app to go along with my qb online. i would give it 5 stars except it doesn't read receipts that are photographed. it would be nice if picture of the receipt could be scanned and information entered in fields automatically. ..to speed up quick entries
. easy to use accounting software
awesome app!. best way to keep your finances organized!
reduced feature set. need to have timesheet function put into app!
helpful, but limited.. it is good for a pinch, but it very limited in the interface.
ios 11 not ready? lot of bugs and crashes. every time i‚Äôm make a new invoice it crashes and take a lot to load and open, still missing two things, send invoices by text message and option to choice your start screen menu
what did you do with the functionality?. there is nothing to work with here. qbo has gone from bad to worse. what happened to the 'almost desktop version' i saw in beta?
i like it but am confused. the app works very well, but i am confused how to change a quote from pending to approved. when i click on edit the option does not come up
app as of lately. every time  every single time  i open app, it tells me it must log out because it‚Äôs running critical updates. it worked fine until a week ago. not sure if it‚Äôs related to apple software but it‚Äôs getting old.
must have !!!. if you have a business that serves customers and you want to collect payment at time of service or later, you want this software along with its phone apps to do business in the field. your a fool if you don't !!!!
app is good support is horrible. call qb for basic questions lady name amanda hang up on me.. dial back in the she place me on hold for 15 minutes
incredible. more efficient that this program nothing
. very easy to use. the online version is great for keeping updated, and also for multi user function. i always recommend it!
keeping it together. love this app it really helps me keep my books in order.
learning curve and then it's awesome.. takes some getting used to but i've now got it and it's actually very useful and easy to use. integration between my pc and iphone make it easy on the go and sitting at home. estimates, invoices & expenses all in one app.
crashes now. i used to love it. i got a new iphone updated it and installed quickbooks and it crashes every time i sign in. it says i have to download my company info every time i open the app. it takes 510 minutes to do so. i have contacted customer support multiple times. every time they tell me there should be an update soon and it will be fixed soon. it never changes.
awesome. i love this app, it really gets to the point. there are no in betweens or aggregating pop ups. quickbooks r...o... c... k
. i own a landscape company and have always needed to do invoicing at the job. this works wonderful for me! make the invoice, email it to customer, and they can pay me on the spot!
app keeps crashing. please fix your app... i pay a lot of money a month for your service and this app is terrible. for the most part i have to log into the online service to do any work. please fix your app
great app but needs better reporting. need to see better reporting and tracking of actual sales, mrr, and kpis
love the app. very fast an easy
nice work. each revision makes the app even better. i did not appreciate the price increase but if the service continues to improve then it is valuable to my organization.
. app is not working properly. suppliers details not showing in mobile app.
useless app for working in qbo. only found 2 reports available through the app. can‚Äôt ‚Äúdrill‚Äù into figures on the 2 reports provided. cannot access expenses on coa can‚Äôt really get any work done.
"finally. my clients can take pictures of their cash receipts and upload so i don't have to worry about an audit. i'm a qbo certified user so ""i"" know how to use it, but it's friendly enough that they can too. thanks."
. i have tried to cancel my subscription yet i have just checked my credit card statement and the subscription is still being taken. please stop this. i wish to cancel. i have followed the instructions and i am still paying for some reason.
. it takes a bit to get used to but once you know how to navigate it is great!
instant customer service üëå. great app for small to mid size business. phenomenal integration from windows 10. so far so good. thanks.
nothing works for me. nothing works for me with this app. if i login using desktop, qbo is ok but when i use the app, there is no information; no clients, no invoices, nothing. the subscription says i have a free trial until 2037. phone support was unsuccessful.
. no bugs yet.
. i cant for the life of me grasp how i need to male an account before even seeing a demo or testing. not cool
subscription does not work. after 1 month free trial (in which i never been interested as i was happy to pay from beginning) the app stoped working. payment is demanded, unfortunately on ipad or iphone version either it is not possible to make a paymentsubscription or the instructions are not clear enough or there is an error. to subscribe should be made as easy as possible.
. love using app
. a little bit confusing for new users, but overall an ok experience. online version is better
cannot drill down for info. why bother making an app if you can't drill down for information? i am able to have full functionality with our hosted data base, so why can't intuit make this happen? i love intuit's products, so this is most disappointing.
qb pro advisor loves it!. i'm a pro advisor and love this app! all my business management clients, including entertainers and producers love it as well!
decent. works for me..
. great app and fairly easy to use
quick books. very complete app. easy to use on the go .
. easy to use great app
love this app.... taking pics of receipts and storing them in the cloud is fool proof bookkeeping! the app also makes you categorize them on the spot. as the owner of an income tax business for over 15 years, this sort of documentation is bulletproof in an irs audit. every small business owner should be trained to use this app.
. your app cannot use in india.
. best app ever...
". was great, while it worked. like the previous review, on a galaxy s9 i just get a blank dashboard and cannot enter new expenses. so the product has no use. not very impressed with qb's ""we're working on it"" response. this should have been basic testing done by the team, not by paying customers."
. i love it ...just wish i could personalize information fields on the invoices to accommodate the type of work we do mobile mechanics add fields for vehicle # vin # license plate and mileage would be awesome
. doesn't allow you to update linked bank accounts to bring in new transactions
. i am a employee for a small business, and we use quickbooks for all our invoices, and keep track of customers.
amazing. east, fast and quick to learn. highly recommended
cannot use non us address. quickbooks accountant online cannot he used for locations outside the us
. i can't use it on mi note 5 pro. giving error
. frustrating. slow. pretty much only to be used for creating invoices and receiving payments. maybe reports. wanted something that functioned just like the online version but for my mobile. wanted to catch up on work at opportune moments without having to get the laptop out. would not recommend. client hates it.
discount. one of the best accounting software on the market. the only think that maybe can be added is the discount feature on the invoice.
app issue. i've been using the quickbooks app for over 6 months and it worked fine. now, for the past week the app will not let me access my company data or the data is incorrect after multiple reinstalls. this is very aggravating and qb's customer support stated it's an ios issue. please correct this issue asap. thank you
. easy way to do invoices on the go and trck if customer has viewed invoice.
clue live design. i'm a small business owner and pretty new on here too. since i have had quickbook payments i never receive any problem on the product via laptop, phone or ipad. i see the updates been give problem for others but it just work excellent for me.
. this is a great app and makes it easy to do so many parts of your bookkeeping through your phone. quickbooks online has been such a useful tool, and this is a great part of its use.
saves time = saving money. great way to save time in keeping track of your business expenses and income. worth every penny for me saves me about 48 hours a week in managing my books and business.
qbo is great for business. qbo is great. i just wish i was able to do more from the mobile app. would like the ability to download and classify bank and credit card transactions from the app.
. very professional app
subscription renewal poorly thought out. i have been using qbonline for more than a year. it picked the worst time to time out and demand a subscription renewal. further it requires multiple logins and you must be st your desk top. nothing more frustrating than what amounts to a software crash when you are trying to get things done. huge fail quickbooks
app is crashing.... had to key in a credit card thru the computer because the app keeps crashing and doesn‚Äôt let you charge a card. will change my review after they fix the issue.
"awesome apptool. although i rate it 5 star, there's much improvement that can be made on creating ""invoices"" definitely needs more options and versatility. needs more custom ability in modifying the invoice into something fitting to each customer. overall, keep up the great work and adding new custom features."
excellent program. track my records
exceeded expectations. it may not be perfect but it is way better than it use to be and better than any similar product i have used. integrates well with all my bank and credit card accounts across numerous canadian providers.
great app. i've been using this app since starting our business last year and i don't know what i'd do without it. i love the program. when i started the business i had no idea how to do anything, but this program is very straightforward and makes running our business a breeze. you guys replied almost instantly and now it's working for me again. that's awesome. thank you! i don't know what i'd do without quickbooks. highly recommend this for anyone with a business.
bank transactions not loaded. there are several limitations with this app. but my major issue is the inability to load bank transactions. the connected bank account goes sometimes for weeks or months without the transactions transferred to qb. other times they are uploaded every couple of days. there is no option to upload the transactions manually through the app. i called customer service but no one helped. this makes the phone app pretty much useless.
. makes my work easier
. very disappointed that once the app downloads popup advertising constantly appears on the phone. not only does it just come up on a screen, but no matter what app you may be in you will be diverted to quickbooks app and then diverted to their advertisers page. very annoying! especially in time sensitive situations like login situations on other sites, or snapchat. i am seriously considering deleting the app if they don't fix this problem soon.
problems with touch id. the touch id feature has a lot problems, doesn't work properly, please fix it
great app. i love the app
love this app!!. i love how easy to use this app is but my only problem is that i can't sync it with my company's ocbc account and my shopify's store's inventory.
president. i‚Äôve used quick books on line for a couple years now and i highly recommend it to every one i e spooked to. i‚Äôm on the road a lot and sometimes travel. any were i go i have a virtual office. i don‚Äôt have to skip a beat with the mobil app or the web based qb. just need to work i‚Äôm been able to submit statements from the app.
"don't download latest version!!. software was great before the latest update. now, no more touchid support, no ability to email invoices. we all remember what apple did with the maps mess, i wonder if intuit will have the testicular fortitude to ""can"" the person who attempted to update the already good software?"
nothing works!  waste of money!. on ios: keeps crashing, totally unusable. on safari on mac: tells me to update to the latest version of safari, even though i am on the latest version! what an embarrassmentuseless company!
still in need of basic functionality. timesheets are a must have feature for the mobile app.
great. nice easy to navigate interface. do wish you could import bank transactions like the website though. other than that pretty thorough for what i do.
. its ok. but yet to improve to being a user friendly.
amazing. quickbooks has made my business life so much easier!!! now i can just put all my focus on the work not the billing and etc... you would be a fool not to use quickbooks jeff thiel construction
major flaw. the app ui is pretty good and i really like the interface. the problem is that a lot of my invoices are not even viewable on the app. basically anything that has a delayed charge on it won't show up so there is a major glitch there or something.
user friendly!. this is definitely the bookkeeping app for anyone who is not attuned to being a business owner
great app!. this app makes using accounting software extremely easy and convenient! so easy to go from phone, tablet, and pc.
best program.. essential for any business.
. i can't remember the last time i was this frustrated with an app andor company. more often than not, the app andor the website do not work. they sure don't have any issues with their autorenew and collecting money from users. they just can't figure out how to provide a product that works and customer service that can, or even wants to, help. think long and hard before choosing quickbooks for your business. i wish i had.
great and very useful. don't leave home without it
. can't upgrade... even with tech support's help they can't figure out how to make it work. after writing this review support contacted me and managed to upgrade.
. great tool for a service business! create an invoice and get paid all at the job site in one easy app
. give them your money, but you wont get much back or much help. frustrating just trying to subscribe after they cancelled on me. my details cant be found on their website either, so has all my info and accounts disappeared? try to fill in their help form, cant submit! doesn't recognise my mobile number. seriously!!
mobile vs desktop. i see no reason the same features can‚Äôt be provided in the mobile app as the desktop interface.
hate the app. limited functionality of the app makes it virtually useless... unless i have access to a pic or laptop, i can't do all the things i need to do. the program itself is good, just not sure why the app hasn't caught up yet.
. great software. do your bookkeeping from anywhere. covers all the bases. if the customer asks for an invoice, send it to them while you are standing there talking to them. then have them pay right from your smartphone. no more excuses.
great potential but.... the app has a great potential to replace the web version. however i do not understand why most of the features aren't in the app. i can't attach a pdf file to an invoice!! why? .. or i cant send an statement with the app.. why not ? .. why cant add company seal and stamp on the invoices ? ipad is a very capable device.. the app should bring all the features of the online version.
does not even log into my company. installed the app, entered my login details then tells me sorry it cannot download my company details and to report issue. i've reported and typically the response i get back is to redownload the app???
doesn't work. app doesn't sync all data with quickbooks online. i see only my company name and customer list. no invoices, expenses etc. intuit support we're not able to help.
great app. great app, need work on making all aspects of it to work on a tablet.
love the software. understanding that all software are more friendly on the actual computer than in the cell app, even though, the cell app is very helpful for invoices, estimates, reminders for payments ‚Äúon the go‚Äù just to mention a couple of them. being an 8 years user from checkmark multiledger and payroll and making the transition to quickbooks is just a huge step forward and very efficient for my firm.
. great software. i think very soon, it will change the way people maintain books
payroll missing. the app is great for invoicing, receipts etc however it lacks the ability to do payroll which becomes a hassle for what i need it for.
subscription ridiculous. this subscription crap is getting out of hand. what happened to the days when you could buy software and own it? as if quickbooks itself isn't expensive enough, and i would gladly pay once for a quickbooks android app, $125 a year is ridiculous. i don't need your cloud, i have a server of my own, why shove this crap down people's throats?
love it. wish i could edit my estimate better.
. bit slow !!! otherwise i love it...
great app!. i already loved qb...the app makes my business run even more efficient and allows me to pull up customers bills on the spot or estimates where they can sign. very convenient.
. great functionality for an app
great for working where ever!. i was a desktop user of quickbooks for years. i fought the change to quickbooks online. i couldn't of been more wrong! it is great to be able to access and enter or edit any invoices, send statements, etc. from any device whether it be laptop, iphone or ipad or desktop. make the switch!
. i want & need a 5 star but i cannot get any kind of help with my issue , which is i cannot get my invoices to go out via gmail. help!
love quickbooks. just what we needed. we started a company a year ago and wish we had used quickbooks right from the beginning. it's simple to use and powerful enough to do everything we need to run the accounts effectively.
. it's a good app
. has potential but hasn't let me update any transactions since day one. tells me to try back in a few hours. not the best way to run a business budget. update: it's been a week and still broken. performed all the suggestions in the response article. update 2: yeah did email them like you asked. still waiting for a reply...
record keeping at its finest. works great and keeps my business records up to date at all times. so simple to use but capable of handling any business transaction you may need.
. good app
not reliable. app logged you out while you‚Äôre still driving or doesn‚Äôt log you when you need it to. this used to be a great app but then this glitch happen with it not logging in and logging you out when you don‚Äôt want it to and when you contact customer service there‚Äôs no help other than delete the app and redownload it relogin yeah that doesn‚Äôt work.
. first of all i want to say that qb online is the best accounting software.unfortunatelly the app crashes on samsung s8 oreo.hope this will be fixt soon as is a shame,beeying such a great software.
great app. quickbooks has changed the way we do business. as a small business, such tools are so vital for the day to day running of your business. quickbooks has truly been a revelation for us at blink mode recording studio.
. you suck!!! i hate you guys!!!! you need a support phone number!!!!!
intuitive and very useful!. i'm surprised at how easy this app is to use and how much functionality it has. i'm able to do pretty much all of my typical day to day tasks within this app. it's extremely useful to be able to quickly put together an estimate for a client from my phone or categorize a transaction. intuit, you've done a great job here!
failed to run. i installed the program and as soon as i attempted to begin using it, the program crashes and will now not open at all.
improve inventory management. very good software quickbook .. we are the manufacturer and we want to manage inventory of the raw material also ... when we sell a product then the raw material should be automatically deducted... otherwise very good sofware
finally. finally intuit listened and added access to account registers to this app. now my accounting program tells me how much money i have, owe and are owed. thanks!! once the new online interface harmony is 100% compatible on mobile devices this app can finally go away for good.
. very easy to use app!
buggy and still no way to easily back up data. this is a buggy app that needs to be closed and restarted often, even though it‚Äôs the most expensive app on my phone. believe it or not in order to back up your data you need a windows 7 computer with (out of date and insecure) internet explorer 11 or earlier. come on guys, fix this app!
typical intuit product. buggy, not awesome user experience. slow, lots of errors, doesn't work most of the time and no support. use freshbooks or something else if you care about running a business.
excellent program. i am so impressed with this new app, it is very easy to use and very helpful for my construction business. i don't even have to go to the office to make an invoice i can do it right in my truck on my phone and send it. i can check on expenses... it's a breeze and worth the time to get to know this app and online program.
super simple. i love this app! so easy to take pictures and attach receipts to my transactions, send invoices, take payments, sign docs... very easy and simple...love it!
. great app
app needs additional improvements. please add ability to sync bank and other vendor accounts using the app. also, need outlook calendar for schedule management and payment processing integrated into this app. also need hour start and end tracking tool by each employee along with ability to send text confirmation to customer.
great service. i enjoy each platform they offer for me, computer and iphone. only issue is they hiked up the annual price without notice. still affordable but i was expecting the same price i originally paid.
crap now. sux after update
when i am done, i am done!. as a contractor i love to do my estimates one time, hit convert to invoice one time, hit receive payment one time and i am done with my paperwork and money is heading my way before i leave the job site. when i get home i can just spend time with the family rather than swim through paperwork. great service!
. app is so slow and doesn't have the functionality of the full web version making it pretty useless
stopped working. worked great until about 1 week ago. now i can‚Äôt see income and expense charts. also can‚Äôt view and accept transactions. i‚Äôm using an iphone 7.
not good for multiple businesses. this app is very basic. can't even view multiple accounts without logging out and logging back in.
great app. i don't understand what some people are complaining about it. this app works great. thank you
. have had an issue with sending invoices through my app for the last 3 days. even after several calls and emails no one can tell me when this will be rectified. poor support and unorganized for such a large company.
stopped working on samsung galaxy s6. never had a problem with the app till about 3 weeks ago. it stopped working on my samsung galaxy s6 for no reason. i'm a small business that's on the road a lot and need to be able to send invoices on the spot. please fix it.
design and functionality is poor. the pin code doesn't work. i have to refresh data most of the time. crashes a few times a week. trying to edit description or client info is a pain.
buggy ios13. error email too long amount to high invoice can't add customers via contact address book goes dark probably a lot of other issues .
. super customer service!
the worst customer service ever. don‚Äôt waist your time. trust my word
easy to use once set up!!. works great
. until now i'm happy. i attached all my expenses and i can see how much money i have invested in by small business.
easy to use. makes life easy for tracking all business expenses and payments
excellent. does everything i need to do on the go which is great. don't always get time in a busy day to sit down and send invoices, but i can with this while i'm out.
crash. won't open since last fix. please fix again.
. unworkable garbage. sso doesn't work. can't sign in with otherwise working credentials. leaves orphaned chrome instances running for every failed signon. absolute trash; fire these developers.
quality product. i've just taken over the accounts for the business with little experience and knowledge and i have found quickbooks online very easy to use. issuing invoices and running payroll is quick and simple. the support is extremely good too from professionals who know what they are doing not just anybody in a call centre reading a script.
. using a samsung note edge: cannot update estimates at all. been using this app for months and it constantly locks up and crashes.
. fantastic, easy to use software. i own two small businesses and quickbooks has made my life a lot easier. with the app i can use it anywhere, which is a nice bonus. highly recommend it!
. does not open on my phone. crashed
couldn't do it without this app. love this app. sooooo mobile friendly!
recent update worse. with the recent update, the app won‚Äôt load and immediately shuts down on me. : can‚Äôt access my accounting.
actually makes accounting a little bit fun. i absolutely love the way this app allows me to record, photograph and categorise expenses from receipts. so easy that it actually is fun. delighted that i can get rid of all this paper!
please fix. we use quickbooks constantly. it has enabled us to grow at a much faster rate, helped us keep our books in order, and allows us to take online payments easily. however, the recent update has been causing the app to close unexpectedly and also has many other glitches. please fix intuit. we are not hating on quickbooks, but this is the worst update we have ever seen.
not free. not a free app, just trial. tfn. re: your response, like i said it says it's free but it's not free..
great app. i wish there was a way we could charge credit cards that are already on file
great product. it's much easier to navigate, user friendly and worth every penny. the only con for me is not being able to switch between companies.
. hated it, warning, stay away. it mess up my quickbook online, duplicate everything, customer service promise to contact me, never happened. service bad. do not waste your time downloading. app version is useless, synchronization keep duplicates my receipts, and much more issues. stay away from quickbooks app. still not fix customer support ain't helping either, because is a third party app....
very beneficial app. this is a very beneficial app. it does not replace the pc version but is an excellent aid. it's helpful to send invoices on the go or at the end of a service call. the sooner the customer pays the more chance you will get paid. as long as you keep things simple it is a very good aid!
. why can't i accept payments in the app anymore?
did update have had issues ever since. cannot download all of he files needed keep getting error code 10000. no resolution
great app for every business. i have only played with this app a little to see what it can do, it is a great app for any service business, it automaticly updates all the records when you make a sell or a purchase. perfect if you are bad about keeping up with paperwork, this app will help u do it all as you go.
quick booksuseful app..!. it is amazing and very useful to me...and can you please tell what are the services we can access?
couldn‚Äôt be worse. worst customer service out there. pulled money out of my account when they made a mistake.
no multi currency in app. there is no multi currency function in the ipad app making it useless for entering overseas travel expenses.
. recent updates have greatly improved this app! it used to be hard to switch back to it if you opened another app, but that's now fixed. i love being able to invoice customers right away, record an expense (along with a photo of the receipt) and take a payment.
. very useful app that almost makes bookkeeping fun. almost... :) let's face it, bookkeeping is a dreary chore but this software makes it tolerable and even pleasant some days. good work quickbooks!
. it is a useful tool
update is awful.. please fix the app. it was great until the last update!! can't even get tech support without it crashing.
. this app doesn't work! such a disappointment to say the least! i'll edit my review once the app is available for use! still not working!
everything a small business needs. i absolutely love this app it does everything we need including taking pictures of receipts there's no reason to purchase another application or a scanner when you can do everything from your smartphone. awesome! #callsafe
. i can not believe that this app is this bad. i can only see customers invoices that i have been to in last 2 months. i use to be able to see 10 years worth of invoices. please fix asap. unless you can carry a laptop at all times which is not practical this again is useless. hello quickbooks how about a fix?
for last month since major online update its is useless. when i login it tells me i don‚Äôt have a subscription. i call support they tell me to uninstall the app and reinstall. after reinstall the login works but you cannot switch between your companies. i called them back. they said no one else is reporting this. three users in my offivr are having the same problem. i love the iphone app for entering receipts on the go but i can‚Äôt even do that now.
no supplier invoice. invoices from suppliers can not be captured on the app. you have to log onto the main website  which is extremely slow and cluttered to navigate on a mobile phone.
business owner. qb app is so hard to use and is different on every device. if you lose connection while creating an estimateinvoice etc. you will lose all info imputed and have to reenter everything again
. this app really is useless. i'm having to manually input all of my banking transactions because it never feeds in the real time info as it should. the layout is counter intuitive and frustrating to use. it's like they've made the app but never done any testing or had any feedback on how they can improve it and make it user friendly. my books are an incoherent mess at the moment, this app is supposed to make things easier but it's awful.
. great app for small businesses
not free. this is a free trial, and that is what it should say. now it is going to take me 2 hours to get it removed off all of my devices! annoyed!
quickbooks. this app is a good solution for working on the go. it's a work in progress, but so far it is moving in the right direction. i'm glad to have access to this program on mobile devices.
. i love this app. it allows me to promptly create an invoice on the spot which allows me to close the deal quickly. every small business should use this app!!
. great way to keep track of expenses for the business.
great ap. great easy to use app really close to getting rid of my laptop entirely
unhappy. bad program for ipad and android phone. bad customer service. very dissatisfied.
excellent tool for my biz. since i got this app on my phone i hardly need to go to the office, or open my laptop. love it!
. great app
. made my job very easier. thanks
. this app doesn't work! such a disappointment to say the least! i'll edit my review once the app is available for use! still not working! uninstalling for now! i hope that you fix it!
. its easy but the app needs work to be seemless. its not as userfriendly as the desktop version but for what i use it for its alright.
how do i remove this app from my iphone?. i do not want to use thus app and now i cannot uninstall it from my iphone. l try by holding the icon and get a message asking if i want to share it. does not show in my settings so i cannot delete it there either. can't find online help.
. great app but wish it had access to customer notes and the ability to send a po to vendor
great app. the app is easier to use than the online version on a laptop. well done.
missing key features. most notably, there is no way to create bills on qb for ios. this is a major feature that is just not available without a desktop. i can‚Äôt even use a mobile browser to login because the web gui gets cut off when entering a bill, even in landscape mode on an ipad.
. never works. every time i log in there is always some technical difficulty. makes having an app for a busy business extremely hard. l
. i am downloading this app but downloading is very slow. happening only with this app.
"immediate session time out. immediately logs me out due to ""session time out"", rendering the app completely useless. üòí"
really convenient. love this app. i'm trying it as a trial and i'm sold. we will be getting the monthly service for sure.
. very helpful and detailed information in reports. couple functionality issues when entering credit card transactions. overall, pretty awesome
broken. the last update broke the app. various error messages. can‚Äôt safe expenses anymore. errors include asking to chose a template before saving expenses etc. bad woek
. this app requires a password even though i chose google login. if i need a password anyway, what's the point of a google login?! quickbooks online doesn't require it. disappointed and uninstalling. i have enough accounts as it is.
great app overall. great improvement to the app. can pull up a lot of information on demand. still need some better viewing of bank register on the app. also need to be able to click on expenses in p&l to drill down into the detail. still a great app, but areas to improve.
almost useless. the app is good for sending invoices only. don't expect to be able to do any other business on the app. the mobile site is about as good as healthcare.gov. you can look at some things but forget everything else. again good for sending invoices only. i expected more from a established company.
logs me off all the time. app is constantly requires entering password even with touchid enabled. not sure what the point of touchid is if a password is required
. stopped working and customer support sucks and dropped the call after half an hour
bugs and bugs it a jungle. 1. kicking out of the app very often. 2. not able to email multiple invoices at one time. 3. limited search capabilities. cant search notes and description. :(
. great app and very simple to use.
. great app, but not as functional as desktop version.
. signed on to the mobile app but it will not pull up the data for my business. keeps saying that there is a technical issue. have tried many times. no luck.
can‚Äôt use properly  soooo slow. i can‚Äôt use qbo app properly, the application is so slow, unable to load my data on my mobile (wifi lte network)
. unable to edit or delete products on setup pretty disappointed couldnt load suppliers not an easyapp at all. plus the set tutorial is different to app presented for 10.95 a month
could be much better.. this app needs lots of work. is not possible to assign an expense as billable. is also not possible to add markup from this app. lame.
checking the books on the go. great app to have on the run
app doesn‚Äôt work on ios 11. don‚Äôt waist time
great to send invoices and track them.
to complicated. don‚Äôt know how to get the max out of this app
incomplete and not easy to use. privacy settings are lacking as they previously were in the online version. to be useful, i need to be able to pass the ipad to a sales associate sioux giving them the amount of access they currently have (with the limited privacy settings). also, the login and password system is cumbersome meaning it isn't quick to open up the app to charge a customers card (faster to run it through the online version)
app is crap. the quickbooks app very rarely lets us sign in and when it does many of the functions do not work. i‚Äôve contacted customer service which is a complete joke. their suggestion was to check out the message board to see who else may have the problem we have! why? how about fix the problem!
mr. great app!
awesome. love being able to bill and email from my phone.. great app
i love it!!!!. i've been a real estate agent for over ten years & keep my expenses & income on spreadsheets, what a pain. this is awesome! i do wish however i could keep my mileage in this app also, do that & i'll give you six stars.
keeps crashing. i can't do anything with the app. every time i try to open it, it closes out about 5 seconds later. worked great until the last update.
does it work?. great app. keeps me well ordered and never lets me down
great app!. i already loved qb...the app makes my business run even more efficient and allows me to pull up customers bills on the spot or estimates where they can sign. very convenient.
could be better. still no auto save. it‚Äôs 2018 folks, time to wake up. does not perform the same on my phonetablet as my desktop. i.e automated emails on my desktop autofill my clients name, my phone does not. on my desktop i can switch the order of items on my invoices and estimates, on my phone i cannot. the simple editing features are extremely important on a device that smaller than my hand.
. this app has, literally, changed my financial standing. as a fantastic it engineer but rubbish at business management i would struggle to arrange invoices for the many small jobs that i do. now, with this app, i'm able to raise and send invoices on the spot!
doesn‚Äôt support enough features in app. can‚Äôt generate invoice with cis. not sure i will subscribe after trial.
. just amazing if you don't rate this app 5 stars your not using it to its fullest potential.
no major complaints thus far. pretty convenient to do on the phone. i guess it's worth the subscription fee.
missing features. won't let you attach pdfs. only photos. gives no reason why. the web let's you use pdf. i deal with pdf everyday. pdf is not new. bizarre arbitrary choice by qb. also keeps popping up notifications saying invoices are overdue. they are not.
. your mobile app crashed since 2508. unable to launch until today. app is still not working perfectly. unable to edit details especially product and service. keep suggesting to contact support but app complete freeze when i tapped on support.
app crashes ughhh. app crashes after you sign in. please fix!
making my job easier. more than i expected and easy to use
free trial. what free trial?? it requires a subscription to even open the account!!
new version problems. ever since the last update, i can no longer categorize and add income and expense from the app. it seems the buttons to ‚Äúadd‚Äù do not work.
very limited functionality. the app has very limited functionality  i can‚Äôt even see the purchase ledger on the app never mind post invoices or take photos of them. lists supplier contact information only, not even account balances. useless. i have to log on to full site and try to navigate around it on phone screen which is difficult. oh and by the way, very unhelpful customer service too!
fail update.. update never savessends invoices on either of my 2 devices
a++++. great program!!!
new to business and this is great. i have now completed my second year running my business and without a doubt i owe some of my success to quickbooks as i don't have an admin person it helps me manage things also creates the professional image i need. i prefer using the web platform but when i am on the go and making small purchases for clients i love to add the expenses to their invoice on my phone before i forget!
intuitive and robust.. a welldesigned, robust application. with functionality that crisscrosses accounting and nonaccounting domains, this is definitely a winner and a keeper. as other reviewers have said, support is amazing. the app is always evolving and improving. 5 stars for easeofuse, robustness and flexibility.
can't view customized reports. nice app. not very useful for tracking your business through reports that you have setup using quick books online. what's the point of having your company books in your hand if you can't track the information you need?
. useless. android app does not support in india
pres. good product except for email. if you email invoice and customer does not receive because of their sever being down, you never get notified. this can be a real problem because you do not find out until the customer is past due on the invoice..
please support khmer keyboard. please support khmer keyboard
. this app no longer works. i cannot make invoices, sales receipts, etc. i called quickbooks and they said there is nothing they could do. i have a mobile business and relied on this app, now it's useless.
". this app is trash, has me very upset won't let me add a bank account just keeps saying ""hmm connection error"". this is bs i just signed up for this service and won't let me connect your app sucks and most likely will seek a refund. have tried wifi, mobile, what the funk, not quick in my opinion..."
when i am done, i am done!. as a contractor i love to do my estimates one time, hit convert to invoice one time, hit receive payment one time and i am done with my paperwork and money is heading my way before i leave the job site. when i get home i can just spend time with the family rather than swim through paperwork. great service!
quickbooks updates. can you please tell us what changes your doing it would be nice to know
consider other programs.... purchased quickbooks for the fact it is easy to photograph receipts and upload, which worked for about 2 weeks and now always comes up with a error.... tried reinstalling etc, still doesn‚Äôt work. useless.
need some updates please. the app is good fir me and easy to use .. i would like to insert in settings options to automatically change the color of the invoices every 15 20 days .let say when the invoice goes 15 days old to automatically change in yellow ,then when is 30 days orange ,45days old red and on and on and on :) ;)
awesome job on the ipad app!. really needed this app for quickbooks to keep me mobile. i needed to use quickbooks online but was unable to use my ipad for quickbooks now i can! keep up with the tweaks but i love it!
crashes almost immediately. running ios 12 and then 13 on an iphone 8. installed the app. put my login info in. accepted that no problem. then boom. app crashes and i‚Äôm back to my iphone home screen. rebooted my phone. deleted and reinstalled the app. makes no difference. still crashes. having this app was a big factor in my decision to run my business on quickbooks and now i‚Äôm reconsidering that before i get any deeper.
missing data on iphone and ipad. i have an issues where invoices are missing for some customer on both iphone and ipad. the show up absolutely fine on the web. i can see the payments but get the error when i open the payment qbm.error.00500000.reason.iphone. please fix asap
great app. the app takes a bit to get used to but once you've played with it a bit it's very simple to navigate, update bank transactions and so on
. need to integrate payroll and qb into one app. quickbooks payroll mobile app is not what expected. not sure why employees are not visible in qb's online mobile app.
good customer svc. one month in and not one paper invoice. hvac techs in the field say that it's easy to use.
makes life easy. great app that makes accounting on the fly so simple.
iphone x is not fully supported. thank you for stretching the app the full height of the iphone x. however, features are behind the home slab and is not taking advantage of the processing power because it feels slow. not optimized.
. if you can go anywhere else please do. i'm not sure how thet can, whether it was one person or a group of people in qb, but they consistently took money from our account. with our attorney we are in the process of getting the issue resolved. do not use qb.
. awesome app
time saver & ease of access. if you don't have the app for your small business account already, well you better just click download now! it saves me hours of computer time each week and my clients get the necessary paperwork even when i'm on a job site working. invoicing and inputting receipts has never been easier!
not very good. there seems to be issues here. a lot of errors with login on this updated app. as well as having to wait so long for funds to be deposited. not happy
horrible. crashes every time. horrible customer service. move on to another app.
easy to learn. easy to learn good support. i would like to be able to upload invoices sitting in my iphone pdf or ibooks app, or even better, directly from my email attachments, into the qb app when i am entering expenses. currently i only have the option of entering a photo. best wishes, dee
excellent interface and convenient app. this app is a life saver and helps me run my small business affairs smoothly. i can submit my invoices and estimates on the go with ease. definitely a must app to have.
quickbooksjoist sync. none of this is working at all. for a company that does bookkeeping it‚Äôs ironic that i‚Äôve been charged twice in less than thirty days for a trial period!! none of my invoices are synced, estinates are counted as revenue and quikboojs is stating my 90 day old business has 1000 net profit!! not even remotely possible! this is incredibly frustrating and so i have to work on this on my only day to rest. ridiculous!! do not use this app
superbe app!. je suis travailleur autonome. qbook me facilite la t√¢che (pour ma part, la comptabilit√© est un fardeau) dans le fait de garder un ≈ìil sur les chiffres de mon entreprise . je la recommande hautement! seul conseil: faites vous assister d√®s le d√©but afin de configurer le plan comptable ; y mettre les chiffres exacts d√®s le depart. vous en serez ravis!
. good app, has some minor flaws but does work in a pinch when your out on the road and need to do a quick invoice
. quickbooks accounting app is convenient an easy to navigate.
crashes on ios13. crashes on login as others have noted. unusable now.
good. quite intuitive, would be nice to have an offline mode  create new customer, new estimate or invoice that could synchronize when reconnected to internet. i work out of coverage on many remote camps. aside from that, solid!
. excelent software for small business!
great improvement. i'd been using a really old pc version and am amazed at how much the app has changed, for the better too.
the. boss.....app
great app!!!!. i am a simple tradie and this app has made life so easy! not complicated easy fast and effective.
make that 6 stars. love love love this app! makes life easier!
for on the go. this app works amazing for exactly what is it built for, on the go.
"issues. it was working fine on my ipad up until last week. then starting bugging. not all customer transaction appear on the mobile app. called customer service about it. they told me that they were ""working on it"". we shall see. i pay for it monthly...i asked if i still had to pay this month even though it's not working as advertised...answer was yes. not happy with that answer. i will keep you posted. bob"
crashes all the time and there‚Äôs no way to ask for help.. this app crashes every time i update my iphone, even when i update the app. don‚Äôt even bother trying to contact qb about it, they‚Äôll tell you to uninstall and reinstall (like you don‚Äôt know) and then that‚Äôs about the extent of their support.
small business owner. app has shut down before i could save and i had to start over in the field. i had trouble accessing it in the beginning. it is not easy to add an address to the invoice edit option for the template...
makes my life easier!. keep it up
app not working since update. normally i'd give the app 45 stars but every time i log in now it says sign in successful but there is no online account associated with the email and to start a free trial. however when i login from safari, i get in no problem. please fix as i am unable to access data from my phone.
. i keep getting a error that says unable to view payment because it includes finance charges. very frustrating when you can't view invoices.
useless keeps crashing.. totally useless, cannot open as it keeps crashing, one of the key reasons of subscribing to online quickbooks will be cancelling tomorrow and going elsewhere.
great app!!. just switched from quicken, and i don't know why i waited so long. qb is very versatile and comprehensive.
great app. i love working with quickbooks i can take it with me anywhere i go and makes everything with my business that much easier. i have used other apps that were good but they didn't tie everything together like quickbooks. i highly recommend it.
. the invoice creation option is incredibly useful
. i have been using this app for 6 months. $40 subscription doesn't get me receipt capture, but the $10 subscription gets it... cannot get it to save information once i enter it, tells me to call a support line that seemingly cannot help me.
doesn‚Äôt mirror quickbooks online. it‚Äôs good for looking up customer info like what they owe or phone numbers. if you create an invoice online you may not be able to edit it on the phone. and if you use quickbooks for time tracking the feature doesn‚Äôt seem to be in the cards for the mobile app.
. easier to use service with website through browser. i like the idea of an app but it seems confusing and limiting at the same time.
simply outstanding. i'm floored by the convenience and utility of this app. good work, intuit!
glitches. app has lots of glitches. try to create an invoice and it was not working. quickbooks has been awesome up to this point. i run my whole business through quickbooks in this new update has been a disappointment. should've left it alone!
why!?!. this app and online program is insanely buggy. every time i try and open the app it takes five or six trys before it loads. once it loads i am satisfied at best with the user experience, but if my internet connection isn't a gig a second the app crashes. i wish i didn't pay for a years worth of service or i would delete it with extreme prejudice.
labor cost. the software has all the infrastructure for tracking labor cost to individual customers. why can‚Äôt intuit enable it so the cost can be applied from weekly timesheets to the job cost of individual customers?
garbage. app stinks
invoices. i would like to be able to sort the invoices as they come in by day.
. very disappointed this is a spotty business resource. sync issues. i entered a customer contact once and it appeared as a new payment in my activity tab. update: i have cancelled for other reasons. looking elsewhere. wish it wouldve worked.
. buyer beware. you can't cancel your subscription online or through the app like you would with any other subscription service. you have to call them and play phone tag for a while if you decide that this service isn't right for you.
bad update. won't work at all after i updated today.
okay. i'm new to doing my own bookkeeping and find this product clunky and not very easy to use. issues with importing transactions and program changing dates and the order compared to the bank. it's not very easy to see what account transfers are moving tofrom. it's hard to distinguish credits for debits. poor customer service. no good summary graphs. slow to attach receipts. multiple clicks to do basic things. cuts off file names if there too long.
excellent app!. so convenient for on the go tasks. time entry would be a great addition.
. longtime customer, happy with access remotely
bank transactions not loaded. there are several limitations with this app. but my major issue is the inability to load bank transactions. the connected bank account goes sometimes for weeks or months without the transactions transferred to qb. other times they are uploaded every couple of days. there is no option to upload the transactions manually through the app. i called customer service but no one helped. this makes the phone app pretty much useless.
no employee support. this app doesn't allow you to do anything unless your account is the owner of the books you are looking at. i was added to the subscription but upon logging into the app was told i had no subscriptions. also unable to use my browser as mobile support doesn't exist for the website and they take it a step further by detecting you are using a phone a blocking you from a non mobile version of the site. very disappointing.
. love this app smooth and easy
great app. works good for on the go
addicted to billing now!!!. oh my goodness. this app is no joke. love it and i stay up late looking at all it has to offer and new things. i‚Äôm glad i got this and the card reader. thanks qb
roofing company. the app is great, although it needs an update with bugs fixed. the app won't allow me to modify, save or send invoices. very frustrating.
invoices don‚Äôt look great. the issue i had when using quickbooks was the invoices just didn‚Äôt look very polished or professional. there‚Äôs a way of setting up a custom invoice, but really you want a good default so you don‚Äôt have to muck around.
how can a customer approve an estimate??. why do you have the electronic signature function available for the ipad and not android?? it defeats the purpose of having a tablet on the job site. i may as well stick with my 3 part form.
bank sync. errors while synching bank accounts for matching invoices. this is a basic function and not sure why they cant fix it. account shows as not deposited though its in bank. please fix this.
wonderful app for freelancers. likes: stores repeat client info  allows for cc payment  allows me to include my company logo and information on each invoice.  alerts me of tardy invoices  provides me with easy to read charts and measure each months incomeexpenses dislikes:  credit card payments incurs a hefty fee rather than a monthly charge  all of my invoices have an intuit logo  customer service is not great
app is good, online version great. i do love the ease of use of online version. however, i wish i would have access to bank accounts and credit card accounts on the app. please add these features!
this update is total trash!!!!. errors on just about everything i try to do and things save twice and web pages aren't ready for ipad pro! don't update!!!!!
. great app
don't do it. can't bill a portion of a estimate have to bill it all at once! it will not let you see your job costs per estimate! this is a huge deal i can't believe they haven't fixed this yet. come on qb add another freaken column already! tones of other stuff on the accounting side that i don't know about is missing as well!
whatsapp on iphone. the experience is very good with quick books on iphone. but it is not connecting directly to whatsapp while sending the invoice. the invoice have to be first downloaded into the folder and later it has to be sent.
. edit from original post... qb quickly resolved the issues and this app is great again!  this used to be a great app, i have used it for 4 years but unfortunately it is no longer working... i can no longer login, i keep getting an error saying it can't sync. i hope this gets fixed soon, i run 90% of my business from my phone and having a working phone app is part of the fee we pay for qb online.
. does everything i need and more, really streamlined my admin.....
do not update. i updated 5 minutes ago and already very glitchy with problems!
not bad. app is good. qb online is lacking.
could be better. this online app could be a lot better. limited in what it can do, but not bad for the cost
it's better but still missing few essentials. why are we unable to create bill. one would assume if we can create an invoice we should be able to create a bill as well
. no issues for me yet.
. i can no longer create or see invoices. my home page is literally blank except for the header and the home menu buttons on the bottom.
best business app!!!. i love using qb for my small business. love the auto reconciliation. professional looking quotes and invoices. it's amazing!!!!
‚Äúupdates‚Äù. every time i go to do something the app says it has to log me out to run updates. getting sick of typing my password constantly. (literally 100% of the time i try and use the app.) pretty much just use the website these days.
needs to be qb online, this app is something else entirely.. the ipad version of this program (and android for that matter) really need to match  exactly match  the web version accessed through quickbooks online in a web browser. the differences are notable, and the experience moving from one version to another is unpleasant. i can‚Äôt recommend the ipad version of this program.
subscription does not work. after 1 month free trial (in which i never been interested as i was happy to pay from beginning) the app stoped working. payment is demanded, unfortunately on ipad or iphone version either it is not possible to make a paymentsubscription or the instructions are not clear enough or there is an error. to subscribe should be made as easy as possible.
poor app not intuitive. some features are good, but (and it is a big but), the desktop app does not work, the web app is poor and the iphone app almost forces you to make errors, which you can't seem to undo. this is a waste of money. if the app were more intuitive and flexible then you'd have a winner. for now you won't be putting accountants or spreadsheets of business.
great small business tool. very easy to navigate and enter information. i can enter data on my home computer and then access it with my phone when i'm not in the office. great app
check payment image. i wish if i can take of the customer check payment image and with in it on the app. both of them times it‚Äôs hard to search for invoice number and when customers overpay the system does not stop them and the refund process is so difficult.
. log in issues and it stopped tracking my mileage on its on. i'm trying to pull my information for my taxes and it will not let me log on. more than frustrating, i want my money back!!!! and yes i have tried reinstalling the app!
"very convince. i wish i could you the ""classes"" functionality from my phone though... i just upgrade my online account today and was super excited about that functionality... but it appears not to be available on my phone... which means i can scan my receipts and enter my expenses. but still have to login to assign a class... which is repetition. .."
qb makes me look good. qb app is fantastic. i can write and present an estimate right at the job site or give my customer an invoice, or accept payment. in brief....it makes me look good!
i can‚Äôt look at invoices?. the app is ok. i have basic access to customers and their address and number. but when i go into a customer and try to look for an invoice it isn‚Äôt there. it‚Äôs nowhere to be found?! extremely frustrating!
. i am totally dissatisfied with qb small business app and quickbooks in general. i'm also using an android and having the same syncing problem. i will be cancelling my subscription with quickbooks altogether and will be going with one of their competitors. it has been a waste of my time with all the phone calls with their technical support in the philippines who gave totally incorrect information about the issue which was clarified when i spoke to customer service in sydney.
so simple and quick to use. i have downloaded the app and have been using it for my self employed hairdressing. it is so easy to use and because i use my phone often it's great to pick it up at the end of the day and track my takings in which means i never have to worry about not being up to date. i would highly recommend this to anyone who wants an easy and simple way to keep detailed accounts!
good when it works. i had internet quick books for my small business. had log in problems almost every time i used it. canceled it.
can't add or view expenses. the expenses option is not available! so why to have this app then?
easy to use, very efficient. thank you guys for your great work.
limited features in the app. the app has extremely limited features as compared to web cant send customer statements or edit recurring transactions or match partially paid invoices.
mobile app. great on the go invoicing, works great!
can't download. when i try to download the app, it gives me error 492. i just signed up for qb online and can't use on phone.
quickbooks app. it has all the tools i need and is very convenient
makes life easier!!. quickbooks online, the app, and gopayment have all made my life so much easier. i can now track things in the go and accept payments right on my phone. it works seamlessly!
. it is a great app but there are some days like today when i cannot open the app on my phone and keep saying i should restart it. i really needed to send some invoices today but i couldn't.
. great with invoices and estimates on the go. and i can see our sales dashboard wherever we go.
ipad perfect until ios 8.5. app hasn't worked since 8.5 update. have sent several request about the app crashing and no one has gotten back to me. i've deleted and redone loaded, rebooted ipad, etc. when not crashing it's a 5 star app. please fix asap!
. this software is superb for business owners but need some customization in product and services option they should provide stock quantities in app
. as a sole proprietor it is great to work this app .
can‚Äôt accept transactions. latest update broke ability to match transactions. it‚Äôs like that screen is locked accept buttonsearch or selecting another expense doesn‚Äôt work.
. very easy to use!! i do wish though that there was an option to send overdue invoices.
. now, can't even access some of my clients from the app. i have sent the error logs several times to intuit, but no response. it keeps getting worse. lacking the fingerprint option to login. also, accepting transactions from bank feed in android not as smooth as it is in iphone. app starts freezing after accepting a few transactions. additionally, progressive invoicing does not work in the app. should make it more useful for accountants though, adding bank reconciliations capability would help.
gets the job done!. i can make transaction entries on the move. i really enjoy this app.
love this app. helps a lot with my work
. this app does not get sign in its just waste of time not getting sign in
another weak quickbooks mobile app. once again, with excitement i upgrade only to be letdown. when will intuit make a full function app? i love the message that tells me the function isn't't available for my device but i can access it from my pc...great, i'm still tied to my desk! why bother with the mobile app then?? i love how i can only rate this useless app once in the lifetime of having it,i would give it no stars if i could!
. the best accounting app for beginners
came in clutch. needed to organize and file taxes and p&l reports. quickbooks self employed and main app really helped do this in record time, fast and efficiently. glad i chose quickbooks!
. wow isn't enough ... 100000 problems 1 sollution.. ÿ®ÿ™ŸàŸÅŸäŸÇ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿ≥ÿ®ÿ≠ÿßŸÜŸá Ÿàÿ™ÿπÿßŸÑŸâ ... Ÿà ÿ®ÿ±ÿ≠ŸÖÿ™Ÿá Ÿà ÿ®ŸÅÿ∂ŸÑŸá ... ŸàÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ŸÑŸÑŸá ÿ±ÿ® ÿßŸÑÿπÿßŸÑŸÖŸäŸÜ .. ÿßŸÑÿÆŸäÿ± ŸÉŸÑ ŸÖŸÜ ÿπŸÜÿØ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿ≥ÿ®ÿ≠ÿßŸÜŸá Ÿà ÿ™ÿπÿßŸÑŸâ ...
what‚Äôs going on?. i‚Äôm paying almost $11month for an app that ‚Äúcan‚Äôt update payment information right now.‚Äù this has been going on for weeks. i can‚Äôt even send current invoices. pointless to have at this time.
great app!. i was using quickbooks pro desktop 2013 before going to online 2016. all i can say is wow! i never realized how much i was missing. reconciling expenses with automatic bank and credit card transaction downloads can be done on my phone anywhere and anytime. no need to log into bank and manually download. huge time saver. also keeps me up to date on my finances with great reporting built in and at my fingertips.
. fake reviews on their website. impossible to leave a review. they held $10,000 in ach payments for 18 days without cause. after setup, their ach payments system went down, no notice email went out. our customers couldn't pay, when asked when it would be available, they couldn't give an answer. unreliable and poor customer service. not what i expected from a large financial company.
easy. easy to use, and has all the features i need to run my lawn care business. i recommend it to everyone. my only issue was getting my subscription paid for. i worked it out by calling customer service and they were awesome.
. very effective app fkr my business, just starting to link in with using receipt bank to auto match the bills. happy recommend for small business, would ve nice to have mileage part of the self employed version included too.
won't print invoice with signature from my device. if i could i would give it five stars.. great app
. installed on android yesterday. cannot see anything on dashboard. called customer service and they don't know anything about the issue and can't help. she said she can see it on her iphone. account can be seen on desktop version but the mobile app is useless.
still no deposits. the most useful an obvious feature needed in a mobile app would be deposits. cash and check deposits would be nice.
quick books app. have been using quick books app for my business for a few months now, and i am very impressed with the package, as it's great value for money. i enjoy being able to use the app on my phone as it offer all the services that i need to be able to quickly raise and send invoices and pull up important info.
love this app. the app links straight to your computer so you can send quotes, invoices etc on the move. this is a great small business tool at a great price.
5 star. with expense tracking. this is now awesome
design and user interface is outstanding. very simple to use..
excellent app!. anything that can please my accountant and help me stay organised gets my vote!
okay. this app would be perfect if it didn‚Äôt redirects me to safari to login every single time
still needs work. this is a good general product, but many basic things are still missing. it is significantly better than the last time i tried qbo.
great for mobile small business !. we couldn't live without our quickbooks online mobile app! look up information and match bank transactions right away. would like to see more functionality for customer and vendor invoicing and billing options as well as filtering but overall a great, easy to use tool.
. does not allow me to access payrollemployees data !
. i have 2 quickbooks online accounts. not only does the login not even process half of the time, my accounts from one company show up under the other. if you're looking to move to quickbooks online for the mobile app you're going to have to wait. af far as bug fixes go, this has been going on for at least 10 months now so i'm not holding my breath.
. great app and easy to use!
. input all your expenses for your taxes and not have to worry about keeping all your receipts
. cool app
. excellent and easy to use accounting program, you can do almost everything on your phone or tablet, lots of great features.
. when it works, its great. don't count on it when the internet is even remotely slow. i had to resort to another sales app to complete sales. lost sales and it cost me more money to use the other sales app.
great app for small business owners!. i have a handyman business and this app made the paperwork side of the business easy!! i definitely recommend
still waiting for receipt feature to work. i have made multiple inquiries about the receipt expense feature not working and they haven't even responded let alone fixed the issue. this has been happening for over a year.
really love it,. make me simple i can input data of company everywhere that i want... thanks for this great apps.
works pretty good. latest update works pretty good. still do 90% of work on desktop but it had been useful to have access when i need it
. great app i can't say enough good things about it.its totally awesome, fantastic, outstanding.
no supplier invoice. invoices from suppliers can not be captured on the app. you have to log onto the main website  which is extremely slow and cluttered to navigate on a mobile phone.
generally does not work. if they generally updated everything they might needful go back a step or two. won't even open on the ipad anymore. crashes immediately.
tried them all. i persevered with other systems and intuit quickbooks online has been sensational since i migrated over. excellent adaptability, intergratibility and functional practical to use. very happy! keep up the good updates.
"confusing and cluttered app. i love that nearly all of the features in the desktop app are here in the mobile app. however the interface, especially the home page, is confusing and cluttered. ""company activity"" is a bit useless as the default page. show me the charts of paidunpaid invoices. i think the developers are tasked with including every single feature and that clouds their design judgement. it's not an easy ask but let's make this app more mobile friendly."
. great app, easy to use, very helpful to track your expenses
crashes with galaxy s7 edge android 6.0.1. i have a new samsung galaxy s7 edge running android 6.0.1. every time i try to log into the app it crashes when signing in and offers to send a report. but the send crash report button results in blue screen. have to force close. very frustrated as i am used to using the app constantly. update: customer support was able to assist with the issue once i emailed them.
very disappointing. they frequently change the interface and items move or get hidden. e.g. customers formerly in the dashboard hidden in sales. frequently i quick on a document on a list and the wrong one opens. lists open in various formats for unknown reasons. my favorite lines of invoices disappear when i switch browser tabs to get more order information. hard to believe quickbooks has such a good reputation.
. setup is easy. can't imagine running my business without it. accessible from mobile, desktop and tablet from anywhere. all of my accounts appear seamlessly in qb. started with enterprise edition and switched to online edition. more in tune with my needs. highly recommended it for business operations. shows reports in real time.
. been using this app for almost a full year was working great, now get error and will not sync data. if it does not get fixed will be forced to move to different accounting solution
non emergency medical transportation business owner. there are obviously some differences between the desktop version and the app. the app gives you real time overview of everything you might want to double check on the go. quickbooks is a great tool and the app is a great extension of it.
. it's ok for invoicing other than a few issues with dates. but i'd like to know why supplier transactions entered as a 'bill' through the desktop app don't show up in the mobile app, but 'expenses' do.
. 2 weeks into using this app it has made itself unusable, going back to paper invoices thanks quickbooks!
"getting there. qb online is a great service, but slightly glitchy. the app however just gives me an error message when i tap ""banking"". that's the most important feature!!!"
convenience. work, document, review with my custom needs, deliver receipts to my customers in one transaction and get back to work with my mind clear to work for a reasonably affordable rate.
. they want nothing more than taking your money! wouldn't refund a $10 purchase when they couldn't transfer my subscription to the correct company file. i had a duplicate company file setup during my online migration, which according to support happens often.
. really hard to un subscribe , cheep get what you pay for ...
qb makes me look good. qb app is fantastic. i can write and present an estimate right at the job site or give my customer an invoice, or accept payment. in brief....it makes me look good!
. app no longer works at all. i've tried uninstalling & reinstalling nothing. i've left emails for qb to contact me regarding this and no response. not looking good for them right now
. great app easy to navigate
can‚Äôt record invoice payments. i upgraded my phone from an iphone 8 plus to an xr running ios 13. i installed the quickbooks app from the apple store. when i try to record invoice payments, i get the following error: qbm.error.00001160.reason.iphone i have not found any articles about this error online.
great for contractors. on the go app that helps with contracts and invoices . i can use ipad or even phone to show my clients and get approval and signature for new contracts . just what i was looking for
. i thibk quickbooks hitnthe mark here verybwell nice app not but having a subscription for it all worth it
fantastic!. quickbooks is a great program and is now even better with this mobile app!
crashes with ios 13. just a heads up. when you try to take a picture of a receipt to upload to the account, the app freezes up and you can‚Äôt continue on. restarting the app doesn‚Äôt work either.
terrible app. keeps crashing. keeps dumping you out telling you that ‚Äúcritical updates ‚Äú and must login again. try to login and  am a very longtime customer  it tells you your company is nonexistent. ba humbug. complain to intuit and they say use a ‚Äúsupported‚Äù device. in other words: don‚Äôt use the app. time to find software other than quick books.
easy and quick. love being able to enter transactions on the go via mobile, and then run reports and do analysis on the laptop back home
mobile features. while i like that it allows me access on the go not all features are available as if you were on a desktop. still, great app very useful on the go.
almost right. love the quickbooks online app. use it on both my iphone and ipadvery easy to generate quotes onsite. just wish it allowed me to do purchase orders!
terrible support. the feature that you promote in your advertisement for this app shows a person recording his receipts wich mainly are cash or card paid. the options that you have as type of payments are cheque, credit or other. nobody this days pay by cheque or by credit receipts for small amounts!!!! totally useless!!!
great app would be useful to do bills on it though. reminder email doesn't work on app
. if you even subscribe to their free trial, they will call you dozens of times in a day. its too much. every time a new number, so i can't get rid off. heavy spamming. ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§®‡§æ ‡§π‡§∞‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§ï‡§∞ ‡§∞‡§ñ‡§æ ‡§π‡•à ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§§‡•Å‡§Æ ‡§≤‡•ã‡§ó‡•ã‡§Ç ‡§®‡•á
amazing product. great product for a small company. combining quickbooks online with the phone app is a great tool. being able to look up customers, create invoices, email invoices anywhere you want. i am also excited to be able to pair qb online payment with this also. all in all it's a great product for a great price so many things you can do with it.
. doesn't actually show invoices or customers. features are mostly broken or sporadic. using the website is a much better option.
. nice app
lousy service. spent all morning trying to upload an expense only to be told i had no internet connection. can't it determine i have no server connection? so most of the morning i spent in one que after another and finally hanging up. i must say that the convenience of being mobile outweighed the inconvenience of not having too much versatility, but only if i am able to be mobile. i hate wasting time, and so i want payback.
. was working ok then app was updated,. help centre can't give time to fix or troubleshoot to be able to use this whilst out on jobsites not happy at all costing money
really helpful!!. i am a computer engineer and being able to make estimates and invoices in the field has really helped me!
. great app, handy, easy to use and covers most of the important tasks on the go
crashes when entering a sales receipt. i am new to quickbooks and am super frustrated i can‚Äôt enter a simple sales transaction. it crashes every time. disappointing
brilliant!. easy to use, matches payments received and ties them off with your invoices, easy to see profit and expenses for each month. well worth the monthly payment, my books have never been so easy to keep!
not free it's a trial. you should be more specific when choosing name. you shouldn't misdirect people with it.
. very slow to load.
not user friendly. it probably wouldn't be bad if i kept a spreadsheet handy while i was away from my computer so i could reference invioce and estimate numbers with addresses. it kind of defeats the purpose though.
. poor. this app worked fine for 2 years and now they have recently removed the feature where it automatically adds receipts to transactions. the support morons keep telling me it never existed in the first place but i used it for 2 years! i'm now looking for another app to use in it's stead. avoid it at all costs.
excellent app. couldnt ask for more! all my paperwork centralised in my pocket!
excellent on ipad, good on iphone. i use this app on my ipad and iphone, it's pretty good on the iphone but it's darned good on the ipad. hopefully they will develop more features on both over time as it's still not a total replacement for the web browser version.
negative stars  if possible. i find it amazing intuit promotes such an obvious clunker. why don't they just buy square and tie that in  or at least imitate it. intuit is lost when it comes to transactional businesses. at any rate  as almost all users point out here  this app is useless and should be an embarrassment to intuits development team.
. makes my life much easier! i like the app better than the online version!
needs more... this app needs to have the ability to process statements. then we would not need to use a computer at all. i was expecting to not to need a computer anymore and be completely self sufficient using my ipad or iphone. otherwise it is ok. statements is a huge thing for me.
best app!. best app better then squared
owner. this us the easiest app to use for my business. able to bill my customers on the spot and keep track of all transactions.
. business on the go this is an excellent app
very easy to use, and company responds to queries and requests. i have used this app for 4 months now and find it is constantly improving and great to use
best accounting software i've tried. this has got to be the most intuitive feature rich reasonably priced cloud computing package for small business i've ever seen. waaay better than myob, such a great little app.
disappointed.. as a qbo subscriber, i thought i could get basic financial reports like monthly profit and loss... not so. i'm not sure the app is of use to me at all.
. quickbooks online is reporting an error everytime i try to log on. cannot sync data. reported multiple time. it has not been fixed
superb accounting app. the only mobile app i recommend if you are into real estate. it makes my job as a small real estate owner easier and smarter. thanks quickbooks for this amazing app. great job on maintaining it. cheers! üëçü•Ç
upload receipts feature. snap on mobile new feature saves lots of time as well the ability to drag and drop files or emailing receipts work well and helps expedite petty cash procedures. excellent addition to quickbooks online!!
. best software for any business!
. dont bother if you dont have access to pc or laptop.basic features like editing customer email is not available on mobile devices including tablets.if an invoice isnt sent because the recipient email address sends it back,you have no way of knowing that an error has occurred even when attempting to check via any web browser.caused me ¬£1000's of cashflow headache. contacted customer support,got a nonsensical response.made it sound like the problem is an actual feature of the app and software.
terrible. qbo is probably the worst software i've used since the late 1990's. it is full of bugs, feature shortcomings, and poor support. we've been working with their certified professionals for months and they barely know how the online version works. i'd strongly recommend using any other accounting platform.
i like it. i have enjoyed using this app for the last year. i am blind and it is 99% accessible with my screen reader, voiceover. i only want to report one error. the last update causes the app to crash when trying to edit an expense entry my accountant manages my quickbooks online account, however, when i find an incorrect category has been applied, i cannot fix it. the app crashes when i attempt
good. app.
. good support so far, big program, lots of tools.
convenient. can enter sales receipts and expenses into quick books away from the office. that's a useful add on to their online program.
. newer to the app, so still learning all the in and out of it. but easy to use
wow.... what an amazing product now all we need is timing inside the app for us people who bill by the hour or half.
. nice. i can invoice right on the job. my clients can pay their bill through the email which is huge. more time with my family and less time wondering if the check is in the mail.
. awesome app works well
not able to enter bills. i cannot on this app nor the mobile site enter bills or purchase orders!! its very bad because now payments cannot be entered from my asus padlaptop please update this asap!!!!!
improvements. 1) stock quantity should be displayed in the app 2) round off amount space in invoice
. i like the app in general. please add inventory on your next update. it will be more useful on our comoany while using android.
great app. works exactly as it should
work in progress, work not yet completed. very convenient and functional tomorrow to add expenses and receipts on the go. however only expenses not bills or other random transactions can be accessed through the mobile app. hoping intuit sees the feedback and that all transactions available including bills to be accessed on the mobile app.
. worked fine until they updated the app, now does not work at all, can't even find my account, worthless
good unless u need their help. i had a problem as accidentally created 2 companies in the one profile. subscription applied to wrong company and they had no idea how to fix it. the company with all my accounting was cancelled as ‚Äòtrial ended‚Äô but other company with no data was fully subscribed. very frustrating when dealing with idiots in the phone!
address. please allow me to copy and paste full address inside customer section. currently i can only copy street, city, postal code separately. customer wants me to add address of site worked.
. i can not believe that this app is this bad. i can only see customers invoices that i have been to in last 2 months. i use to be able to see 10 years worth of invoices. please fix asap. unless you can carry a laptop at all times which is not practical this again is useless. hello quickbooks how about a fix?
general manager. garbage company
problems. what my bookkeeper is finding is payments being applied to the wrong invoices. it‚Äôs really messed things up. from the checks being deposited from my bank. also, for some reason my quickbooks is duplicating invoices. i will have to erase the app and download again.
great for small businesses. we own a professional cleaning company on the big island of hawaii and are on the road a lot. this app is great for us for invoicing and writing proposals on the go. every client is important and we are able to service each one promptly and professionally.
awesome app. this is a brilliant app. i have all my invoices and expenses at my fingertips. very easy to use and synchs perfectly with qbo on my mac. keeps me on track with daily reminders of overdue invoices. no one gets away with not paying me now.
fantastic app with room for improvement. this is a really great app allowing you to perform your data entry while on the move. however, i really wish u could of saved your electronic signature and that it was available for the web app. the bills feature is also missing from the mobile app.
it's okay. can't send reminders or edit invoices ... kind of a pain.. great for sending invoices on the go though !
user friendly. easy to use!
. great software i use it on my laptop, phone and tablet. easy to use very happy with product. would recommend to any business owner
confused. unlike using my laptop to filter purchases, payments, and deposits the app is extremely confusing and when purchases are made you cannot view them live or even see previous ones, instead i have to spend a lot of time logging them in. i purchased the quickbooks online through my laptop in hopes that the app would make my accounting easier by using my phone, as i do not have time to constantly log into my laptop. the app is too time consuming and confusing.
ios 13. crashing please update
. does everything i need it to!
. this is a easy to use app and makes keeping track of finances easy i'm still having no problems using quickbooks and it just gets easier and easier . and if you need help the team is there , i recommend this especially if you have no real experience u swing an accounting system
app crashes on ios 9 and ios 10. when i click on support it takes you to a web page that also does not work properly. do you have email support ?
. i love this app! it and all the other quickbooks apps have revolutionized my business!
fix it!!!!!!!!. when it works i like it, but when it flips out it is so frustrating. every time they update it it takes another couple updates to fix it. leave well enough alone!
. their cancellation process is brutal. thea button to do it myself online wasn't available, waited on hold forever for the phone number support page said to call, chat didn't answer forever then replied then immediately ended the chat because i didn't respond right away, chat after that kept delaying cancelling (i'm still not cancelled, had the time to write all this while trying to  waiting for chat to cancel)
really good program. keep up the good work
game changer. this has been a fantastic app. having the ability to access our estimating and billing from any devise has been great !
great for small startup. just started using the app as the business grows it has been easy to track travel expenses and everything else we need to keep growing.
feed. need to be able to change from sales receipt to invoice without canceling and starting over. would also be nice if every few months we didn‚Äôt have to delete and reinstall
great app. great app for tracking all my company transactions. love that i can get a tax report for quarterly reporting.
president of fls. i am able to see what is going on with my business when i want and i am able to make decisions about a job or customer even if i am away from the office.
love it!!. makes life easier being able to enter transactions from my phone!
charts not found. both on the commercial and in the android preview, they display charts from the app. but they are no where to be found.
. so far this has made invoices quick and easy
. will add fifth star when they add support for inventory tracking
the app is good. it works well for me
. i find this really useful to check accounts and send invoices whilst onsite. never had any issues with the app at all.
. game changer! i've only had it downloaded for 5 minutes and i love it! i will change this review, if any hiccups change my mind, after further use.
cannot drill down for info. why bother making an app if you can't drill down for information? i am able to have full functionality with our hosted data base, so why can't intuit make this happen? i love intuit's products, so this is most disappointing.
invoice and estimates not saving after last update. you will have to delete app. then reinstall then it will save.
glitchy, incomplete features, and poor data. this app needs serious attention. after years of putting up with this hot mess i‚Äôm fed up and rarely use it any more. no matter what i do i can‚Äôt get data to load that is any more recent than 2016 for most vendors. no one from tech support replies  ever. american express transactions can‚Äôt be synched or approved in the app. about the only thing it‚Äôs useful for is matching typical transactions in our checking account.
. really need to be able to create a purchase order using the app
cc payment signature window. love the app but, something was changed in one of the recent updates. the screen for the customer to sign to authorize cc payment was made into smaller window. every time you touch it to try and sign, it just moves the window up and down. you can barely make a single line. starting to get frustrating for customers and myself. please address this asap thanks!
quickbooks online accounting software.. this app is not a doubleentry system accounting app, but rather a singleentry bookkeeping in which you only need to log each transaction of income or expense once, in the way quicken and other check writing software programs work,
backward compatibility entrapment. i thought i‚Äôd try the trial online plus version after being happy with essentials. was not advised during the offer that going back meant having to reenter much of my historical data manually. now i pay for features i do not use or like. their help desk just kinda said...‚Äôoh well‚Äô. they didn‚Äôt even offer to extend the trial offer incentive that had me curious about the product. intuit calls it ‚Äòstickiness‚Äô. i call it entrapment.
quickbooks app. does not work well. needs a lot of improvements. each time i back up my files i end of with multiple copies on my ipad. have called several times and each time they blame the app developer which i have contacted but never heard back from them. poor program that needs fixing to get it up to good standards. do not recommend until they fix problems.
shoameli. very good for my company on the go i have all i need maybe a catalog will be even better!
not enough!. this app does not have the functionality that qbo has. therefore, useless. if we can't use the ipads in the store, what use is the app? 1. can't enter an invoice with the details 2. can't enter a vendor bill and do splits. 3. can't put payments in undeposited funds. 4. yep, useless.
. great app. for business on the go. love doing invoices com my smart phone.
not as good as desktop. needs to be able to do more with employees and checking invoices and managing the dashboard
great program. i like it's ease of and accessibility from anywhere. i haven't had any issues.
. great app love that i can use it anywhere i need.
. your app is not allowing me to create an account. it's keeps saying content type missing. really would of loved to use this app.
user friendly. this app is super easy to use
. this is false advertising. it's not free!
solid app. works great and made billing so much faster.
great. amazing app but whoever did that last update screw it all up. can save estimate or invoices. horrible. i hope they refund at least a month of fees because i'm loosing money having to do all my estimatesinvoices at my house instead. needs to be fixed asap.
qb app is useless. i‚Äôve been quickbooks user for a long time and discovered this app gives a totally different set of numbers than quickbooks online does. expenses are different than real version so please beware, you can‚Äôt trust the numbers. contacted support to no avail. i guess they don‚Äôt read the other reviews either.
professional it consultant. i recommend this app for smb, especially when you're out of the office a lot.
so much better than sage. we moved from sage to this and haven‚Äôt looked back. the app is better and the links to banks work (unlike sage). the help and support is better than sage too. all in all, well worth a trial.
. keeps crashing when entering receipts. it's infuriating. updated review 6 months later still crashes when splitting an expense. tried deleting the cache. it's useless.
. not able to switch between companies using app followed instructions from developer which did not exist in app. faq site link doesn't exist.
bmb. i cannot connect with my canadian credit union. have been using app for several months now. it is both good and bad. i love that i can take my work with me to record with my ipad, but would like to be able to transfer transactions from quickbooks online to quickbooks pro 2014.
. it's doesn't work in india
awesome app. it's very user friendly and informative. i really like how easy it is to assign an expense category and the convenient display of the profit  loss feature.
awesome app. this app really helps me keep track of all my transactions for my pool business. easy to use and has everything i need.
. great app
great for my small business. this works great for my small business. it's easy to enter invoices and set up customer accounts on the go. my only down fall is that when you email a customer an invoice. it does not give the pay now option like when you email from the computer version of quickbooks simple start online. it just gives a pdf copy of the invoice.
. great and simple to use, whether using the computer or phone.
. love being able to work in quickbooks from my phone! one of the best features is being able to take a picture of your receipt and attach it to your expenses right from your phone. makes your bookkeeping incredibly easy! wonderful customer service, love the payroll, too many good things to say about this app.!
elecsmart electricians ltd london. great app could do with some tweaks here and there but 5 stars are given !
categorize expense. useful. would be better if it can scan the photo and also categorize expenses.
too many clicks for attachments. i keep track of all transactions by taking pictures of the receipt, checks, deposit receipts, and just about everything then attach them to the transaction. with the user interface rule of thumb of three clicks access to specific functions, attachments can take as many as five to six clicks to save a picture, which is very annoying and time consuming.
excellent. i am a pro exterminator and i have been using this app since i launched my company federal bug investigators in 2012. it's features are amazing and allow me to create an invoice, charge a card on the spot and more, while out in the field or away from the office. thanks to this technology i am an elite entrepreneur.
great apps. good performance
great app. this is a great app for small businesses.
love it. just be cautious when trying 30 free trail. i loaded half a dozen customers and lots of estimates,invoices etc. and then purchased the 6 month subscription after i got familiar with software. well it led to doing work twice. because you can only have one or the other, free trail discounted 6 months subscription.
app doesn‚Äôt recognize credentials. this app worked well for me until the most recent update. now i cant login, says can‚Äôt find the account with this emailpassword. this is very annoying since i travel frequently without a laptop. now i‚Äôve lost the ability to access my accounts via the app.
great app. love the app. been using for years and have never had an issue
. great app
doesn't work for ipad. this app doesn't even load my company info. it keeps returning error trying to load company info. i have contacted quickbooks a number of times and all they say is they are working on the issue and to use a web browser version in the mean time. i have seen about 4 updates released and not one of them has fixed this issue. when will this be fixed?
easy to use. should have done this sooner!
bad update. this update is very bad. activities don't come up anymore. have to navigate to long to find stuff... i don't need to see company details first. i need to see customer activities.... this is such a waste of time and very frustrating. now i have to search for a new program.
. great for small business people who invoice track estimate all on the go
great starter app. i wouldn't want to use this app all the time as is is a little annoying. does what it says on the tin, great as a starter accountancy tool.
payroll. it is worthless for me. uninstalled it as soon as it was installed. can't do payroll.
new receipt feature not properly tested!. this new receipt photo feature is terrible. it captures about half the receipt every time! fix it, and test your changes before releasing them. a massive step back.
exelent app. recomended. exelent app. recomended
can't wait for more!. yeah, it's not going to be the only way you use quickbooks. but having the opportunity to have a mobile capability is immensely helpful. it's how you use it and when to that makes this app great!
simply the best. simple and easy to understand and use. above all, the free technical support is out of this world. go for it, you cannot go wrong.
love the app!. absolutely love this app. i can do everything on my phone on the go and hardly ever need to pull up qb on my computer. beautiful lay out, intuitive design and easy to use.... i'd rate it an a+ üëç
very helpful. i am learning and enjoying the app.
best accountant i‚Äôve used.. seriously helped me narrow down how many hats my small business required me to wear. wish i done it sooner.
downloading company data 247. when the app works it‚Äôs good and the recent updates have proved helpful. however 9 times out of 10 i am unable to use this app. it is constantly in a state of downloading my company data and while i do this all i can do is wait. very frustrating. as a result i have access qb through chrome on my phone and that has a number of rendering issues.
app ruined. this is getting old. the app seems to be unusable every time an update heads out way. my invoices are showing old data, are not updating to show payments and do not match what is correctly shown in the real online desktop service. please fix , and stop updating prior to testing
. nao consegui nem finalizar o login ele simplesmente n√£o entra.
. we love quickbooks! it helps you to stay organized and keep track of your income and expenses so when tax season comes you have it all ready. we have found it very useful!
. very simple to use.
good program. does what it is suppose to do
please add a ‚Äútransfer‚Äù option on app. overall good app but would like to have a transfer option on the mobile app i find myself having to login to the desktop version just to transfer amounts between my accounts. also, someone please find a way to mark estimates as ‚Äúreadseen‚Äù by the customer just like the invoices do. ipad version needs help; jumps around too much
horrible update!. wow this latest update has messed everything up quickbooks was finally working good please fix! some of the words don't even fit correctly on the screen its all mixed together! and worst of all like others have said it no longer knows my clients email address i have to manually input!
. it is really user friendly.
love!!. the quickbooks app is absolutely perfect! when handling business on the go and clients are making payments, i can easily create an invoice andor sales receipt. makes my job easier. it tracks all of our business expenses, profits and losses. this is great!
perfect for my small business. i am a wedding photographer and quickbooks online is the best way for me to keep track of my expensesrentals and write up a quick invoice or estimate while i am on the road. i absolutely love how user friendly it is. as long as i have my smart phone i can work from anywhere.
. this app is very useful for my shop for trak inventory item and gst purpose and more
does not show suppliers. since update app does not show suppliers or let you add expense, which makes mobile app a waste of time
sign in problems. there should be a way to sign in without a password or touch id. for me touch id rarely works.
. card reader does not work for htc. card reader does not work
great app but needs better reporting. need to see better reporting access on the app. i can‚Äôt run balance sheets on a custom format and it‚Äôs annoying.
almost there!!. please, please, please qbüôèüèº you're a few key functions away from making this app the mobile office.
no bad. there are several things that are better with the app and qb's online, however the lack of personalisation with the invoicing are rather pants and why the system doesn't have a clocking in facility for employees yet is beyond me could be done easily through a simple app and gps no?? and then integrated into job sheets
nice apps. nice apps
great support but app is flawed. i have several companies setup on one login. this was done by qb themselves but it keeps crashing, stalling or telling me there is a fault. also don't choose 'other' as business type as list of income and expenditure categories is massively reduced and you will have to add the ones you want manually. customer service is excellent but i shouldn't need to know this!
app does not support multicurrency. it‚Äôs 2018. apps have been around for quite a while now. if your qbo account has multiple currencies enabled, you can‚Äôt use this app for banking. seriously, wtf?
very helpful. the app has let me cut down on paper records quite a bit. there's more functionality online than the app has which i didnt discover until 4 months of use. overall it`s proven helpful though.
. was working ok then app was updated,. help centre can't give time to fix or troubleshoot to be able to use this whilst out on jobsites not happy at all costing money
keep crashing. after last update keep crashing. doesn‚Äôt launch the app please fix asap
great. makes invoices and estimates from phone look right professional. i use the desktop version as well and it would be great if the different versions spoke to each otherwise best solution by far
app. best app
stopped working after the update. this was working great until the software update last week. now i end up creating multiple copies of invoices and estimates and the app just freezes on the saving screen. i can only finish off by logging in through a web browser and completing the task. please fix this fast intuit!
best addition for any business on the go!. the free trial was amazing. my favorite part is having the ability to send invoices. while setting up my merchant services, customer support was kind and easy to work with. now it's easier to bill my clients from my phone. i track everything. get the quickbooks app. you won't regret it!
highly functional for an app. unlike other folks i find that i can get the majority of what i need to accomplish for daytoday business done on this app. very user friendly.
. its very good program keeping my books in order, reminding of unpaid invoices connects to external management software, great stuff
major flaw  can‚Äôt add receipts to expenses. no dropbox or photo option. they advertise this system as super easy and convenient. you can‚Äôt add receipts from photos or dropbox. that makes the ‚Äòadd attachment ‚Äò pretty much pointless. i take a picture of an expense receipt but 0 way of adding it ... seriously. who designed this app.???
. i attempted to open an account and a symbol is required to create a password. my 3 bank accounts don't even require a symbol. i just reset all of my accounts with a new password. i'm not changing this password to please quickbooks.
. app is crashing. also, when it does log in successfully, it doesn't remember my state from previous login. it needs to downloads stacks of data all over again.
doesn‚Äôt support enough features in app. can‚Äôt generate invoice with cis. not sure i will subscribe after trial.
easy, fast and efficient. this app keeps me organized and on top of my cash flow. it is easier to use than the web interface and it's always with me when i'm on the road. as a mobile trainer, this is invaluable. once customers and vendors are set up, it takes seconds to update invoices, payments, and receipts. highly recommend.
release ios 13 update now. i pay way too much money, and it‚Äôs going up in october, for you not to have an update day one ios 13 is released. you guys are always behind with the bugs. i cant even click on a customer, save an invoice, send an email etc. give me what i‚Äôm paying for.
indispensable. the package of apps for mac, ipad and iphone is perfect for my business. saves hours of my time.
. love my quickbooks online, but this app lacks the one feature i need. i'm an attorney and want to be able to add single time activities. it's often when i am out and about that i need to capture some time, and this app would make all the difference.
. dreadful experience so far. bought qb 16th dec 2019 and cant get a call back from an english speaker to help me with set up despite multiple attempts! why is sales uk based but support isnt? this is 2nd review  1st disappeared!!! so disappointed and very desperate to get started. i can login to qb online but says im in usa not uk please tell me who to email in response qb
great for keeping up with receipts!. instead of having to carry around all of the business receipts that i use, i'm able to take a quick shot with my camera upload it and then i'm all digital.
does not work in india. it is not operational in india... looking forward that it will be made available in this region soon.
ios 13 problems. quickbooks is normally pretty good, the online version is fantastic. unfortunately the app no longer works on ios13, i will come back once the app has been updated and revise my review.
. the online version of quickbooks works well, but the app is terrible. we are in 2018 and the apps still can't do anything useful. why can't we have the same functions and features as the online version. i want to be able to view all my reports at any time. easily key in transactions. the app needs some serious work. no joke.
improvements need to be in desktop version too. happy to have amount remaining automatically calculated in expense entries when splitting items between multiple categories! the online desktop version used to have this feature as well but went way with a recent upgrade, add it back please
great app  shame about the price. used this for almost 2 years now but need to find an alternative following a 70% price increase. it‚Äôs a shame, and it‚Äôs causing hassle for me in setting up my records with another accounting app but the only way we can object to such massive price changes is to cancel and leave.
love it!. quickbooks has changed the way we invoice and track expenses. the ability to provide estimates then convert to invoices is amazing. the mobile app allows me to work on the go.
horrible. what a joke. all i want to do is be able to go to my online account. every time i try to do that it pops up to install this app. i did. now when i go in nothing looks the same or works the same. you would think i would be able to go online without this horrible app. i would give it zero stars if i could.
. it sucks scam!!! so i tried quickbooks just for hel,p i got logged out of the app and now i have to pay $400 just to restart my password other companies are free.
way too limited. the app for the ipad is too basic. i can create an invoice and email or print but if i need to print an existing invoice there is no option to do this. after receiving payments there is no way to deposit them to my bank. i can't believe that qb would release an app before testing it. i am hoping that there will be an upgrade soon to make it functional. disappointed!
"problems. this app will not let me save an invoice, it always says ""this number already exists"" no matter which number i add. only started the error on the 301112, please fix."
cpo. love, love, love qb app! i can create invoices & sales receipts on the go & easily  even process credit card payments.
great app!. super convenient to track all my business transactions on the go. recent updates have made it much easier and more features are accessible.
great but........ i love the app but it could use a bit more integration. for instance, you can airprint an invoice but you can't airprint a paid invoice. seems like an oversight.
worst ‚Äúupgrade‚Äù process ever!!!!. if you have self employed don‚Äôt even dream of trying to fluidly upgrade to online. they data doesn‚Äôt just migrate over. the tech support people are clueless. one sharing my screen hadn‚Äôt ever even seen what self employed looked like and had no idea how anything worked compared to online. it‚Äôs total frustration.
poor experience. the app is extremely buggy, unstable, and very slow. logging into the app is unpredictable and i'm randomly logged out. entering receipts is quite painful to say the least, and is impossible without a decent internet connection.
really good !. used a different invoicing program for years but would not sync with quickbooks. so i went over to the best and figuring it out. quickbooks online has made it easy to work through. good job developers !! been 8 months now and have to say quickbooks online has been excellent ! not too hard to learn and very easy for my customers. a winwin
quickbooks online plus. loving the new updates with invoice tracking and the ease of excepting credit cards in the app. getting paid is easier and quicker than ever.
. i don't like to forcefully create account first. without using application how can i create account. other apps like this type providing use without login so why you requires login first???
excellent!!. i find the app useful when i need it most. i enjoy the ability to add an expense at any time. sales receipts are handy. basically everything i really need without requiring a ton of space on my phone.
brutal support and comparability. currently looking for another accounting solution. the intentional limitations and total lack of cooperation with the support team leads me to the opinion that all positive reviews are fake. epic fail intuit.
. it is very nice application, i like it, but we wish in future to be supported by arabic language so we can fit new rules issuing invoices in both english an arabic
life saver!. i absolutely love this app. when i first started out and i didn't have that many funds in the bank, this was one expense i didn't even have to overthink. after using quickbooks online app for only a week i knew i could never go back to organizing my finances on my own. i use it every single day!
seems good so far!. i just downloaded the app, however for what i use qb for, this app is perfect and will definitely make my time more efficient. i am always on the go and handwrite all checks. from what i can see, you can quickly enter checks written (and even take a picture) and also manage your online banking. which is perfect for my needs.
". the fingerprint authentication doesn't work. says ""error returned from client"" when i try to enable it. others mentioned screenshots don't work. i know there is a workaround, but that requires you to permit it every time you want to use it because it limits you to 15 minutes. there are no reports available on here which is most important to me."
bad. bad app they will take your money and not give you service am contacting federal trade commission
office portability. i can post info on the fly, keeping my books up to date, even up to the minute. my clients can get estimates instantly when asking for them. my bookkeeper can see what's going on with me right now.
better than xero. brilliant app. seamless to use. all of my clients now use it!
quickbooks online is a nightmare!. big mistake. if you are considering quickbooks online talk to some bookkeepers first or you may find yourself doing the books because so many of them refuse to work with the online version. once you upload your data to the online version there is no way of downloading the data to go back to regular quickbooks! as for the app, well it's as frustrating as as the online program.
slow books. can‚Äôt accept transactions in banking section. sluggish app, end up using the computer more often.
". mobile app is full of bugs, recent ""update"" has now made it so my account is unable to sync and wont let me log in. not very useful for my mobile business. tried reinstalling the app, still no luck."
. can not login
. takes way to long to update between quick books online.
. this app sucks can not access anything very frustratung have to go to desktop on my phone its a nightmere going to look for something that actulay works from a moble device takes to much time fighting to use sucks
nice app. excellent app
"awesome app. used quickbooks for a number of years professionally and this app gives my clients awesome flexibility to do ""do"" their bookkeeping on the move. i recommend it to all my clients."
". mobile app is full of bugs, recent ""update"" has now made it so my account is unable to sync and wont let me log in. not very useful for my mobile business. tried reinstalling the app, still no luck. *tried clearing data, same issue."
. nice app. easy to build and send invoices.
owner. great app
. i didn't worry about computer crash losing all my data plus it goes with me everywhere. but the app does not work right now. 7 weeks & no feed back
bad update. can no longer accept credit card payments. keep getting error code 6000. tech support advised this is a known issue but no eta on fix. please revert back to previous version.
. great software. easy to use!
i'm an accountant. it make my life sooooo easy...live doing accounts from the swimming pool with a cocktail in a hand and phone on other ;) i‚ù§technology
. wow. can't even describe how annoyed i am right now. this app is horrible. it wouldn't even allow me to complete the account creation process. i attempted 5 times and no luck, so i'm leaving this review and uninstalling it now. get to work quickbooks, this is disgraceful.
. the app is fantastic everything works well little exhausting to set accounts and banking but once everything is done and working it's very efficient and my customers can get their invoices very quickly plus in my electrical construction business.
extraordinary app for business beyond traditional desktop. quickbooks rules a new dimension on simplified business processes. it is a great app well synchronized with online services, so you can manage different critical aspects of your business on the way and connected. its interface reflects trust, flexibility and fluidity.
. this is a great app for my small business and has helped me to stay organized and saves time!
great. great app easy to use and all but needs a mileage tracker logbook like the quickbooks self employed has
. this is my first year using quickbooks. so much easier to track all expenses and sales.
. seems a little pointless if the vendor activity doesn't sync.
frustrating. decided to go with qb to simplify my accounts and let me do them incrementally through the month. very disappointed that sync works intermittently and leaves gaps. may be returning to paper is it isn‚Äôt sorted soon
. banking is better and easier with the quickbooks app
best business app. very quick, no bugs or errors. love it!!!
excellent app. moved from xero to qbo and couldn't be happier
app works great. easy to do quick info inserts
. great app
basic app. app functions are extremely limited, and i can't use qb web on any browser on ios devices (ipadipad pro 12.9iphone 7plus) as all browsers including safari, chrome and dolphin run in zoomed mode when want to enter invoice, payments, receipts and bills or even check reports and make unusable.
. so easy to use! i wish i had started to use this when i set up my business! it saves me so much time and i can enter transactions from my tablet which is so convenient. i also love the way it links (safely) to my bank account and automatically brings all my transactions into quickbooks. would strongly recommend!
phone. phone app is better than pc version
. very glitchy and slow in android
. the app has no way to change to accural from cash basis
. best mobile financial app for a small businesses period
. like the app. interface is great. would like to see an charge option for customers, so i can tally up customer's account over the course of a month and bill at the end for my lawn care business.
love it!. simplifies life. amazing phone support. always improving.
app won't open after latest update! please fix asap!. app won't open after latest update! please fix asap!
very frustrating. i can't understand why quickbooks refuses to put time tracking in their mobile app. time tracking is weak at best on a desktop but excluding it on mobile makes no sense. as a graphic designer who only sells time, this is close to worthless.
can‚Äôt subscribe after trial period. it‚Äôs a good quickbooks version but i started trial period made a profile and invoices but the app won‚Äôt let me renew subscription the buy now button doesn‚Äôt work when clicked on. now i may have to start another profile and lose everything?
. save's me from having to carry invoices.
poor service, poor quality product. this product is the worst i have had to deal with. service is non existent, the app is constantly in errors, backing up is slow, the system does manual and not by the operator, everytime the + symbol is used it closes the app. my accountant doesn‚Äôt even like the system. i have loaded, unloaded and reloaded the app so many times it‚Äôs no longer a joke. quick books tells me they fixed the fault, like never.
. awsome. able to do almost everything on my phone. i literally only use my phone and have done just fine. have only had to use a computer for some settings but other than that it's wonderful. easy to operate . üëå
customer service and functions. you can be completely locked out upon renewal of your subscription. it has locked me out of entering for the last six days. tech support has been pretty useless at fixing it. with all the other flaws the online program has, avoid with every thing you have. you get no back up, high incompatibility, and many accountants hate it. your emailed invoice has a habit of hitting the spam bin,it isn't even compatible with other intuit products. avoid avoid avoid
. i have been a happy customer u till this new update every time i try to logon it keeps saying the internet seems to be offline... now i can not update my sales n payments
. love this app, keeps track of all my expenses and payments from clients. easiest way to do estimates and invoices as well.
. the creator of this app is a known sex offender
. the app is useless. google sign in simply doesn't work. links to my invoices still open in browser even when i have the app installed.
crashes. would give it 0 stars if possible. crashes immediately after opening page information is submitted. don't waste your time
. quick and easy to use. clients have been very receptive to there invoices or estimates. definitely have recommended this to other small business owners.
crap!. can't create an invoice in the app that has cis? really? why not? so i can't do my invoices on the go?! rubbish app rubbish system! use another programme!
does not do simple qb tasks. this app does not have all the functions as the computer online version. i can't run simple reports and the payroll app which is separate does not allow me to make changes to the employee information. doesn't function like you need it to and it put me in a bind when i went out of town with just my ipad. i would not even give it one star. worthless.
all of my clients love it!. the ease of use is fantastic. i love that i can quickly load multiple accounts. the qbo app makes my job so much easier because my clients love tracking expenses and sending invoices on the go!
great app for independent contractors. qb helps me stay on top of my invoices and keeps me organized.
advancedenglish.com.br. the app is good, but there is room to improve, such as the option to assign an expense to a supplier.
make thing simple. we work away from the office all the time. q on the smart phone makes that easy. and it has never locked any of phones up. it work great.
great. very user friendly
great way to keep up with small business book keeping. in previous years, with my software based quickbooks, i ended up doing most of my neglected books once a year for tax times. with this i do an update on a daily bases and will have do just a little detailing come years end.
best app ever. just wanted to thank the development team for helping me to manage my business easier with this app.
statement from app ?. works great for me but i wish you were able to print off a statement from the app.
broken after update. not updating customer data, crashing, please fix it, i have a business to run!
doesn‚Äôt work with ios13. pls fix
. the app use to work fine but since last month i can not update any invoice in the app. it keep givig me error unable to edit. there was adding this invoice. if this problem continues please call customer care. i have uninstalled and installed saveral time no luck.
projectivity. great app for my consulting business. once you enter your data quick books can show you a picture of what your business looks like; where your money is coming in by customer. instantly produces reports, reminds you if you have invoices overdue and can be linked to your bank. what more would a small business want? i love this bookkeeping program. :)
overall pretty good as an appüëç. it can take awhile to get used to using quickbooks ‚Äì but it is pretty good once you get used to it. occasionally it can be a bit clunky and you don‚Äôt get all the functionality that you would expect. but overall using it as an app is very good
. great app. this is the one my cpa recommends. it's easily is sent to him for my taxes.
latest update. the last update has the photo settings all messed up. you can no longer capture a good picture that will send with invoices. it either won‚Äôt attach to the invoice or it‚Äôs cropped automatically to the point the entire page doesn‚Äôt show. needs to be fixed. already looking at other options for my business.
no longer works with ios 13. i just updated to ios 13. the app now crashes immediately after it tries to launch my company. i tried reinstalling it but no luck. please fix this asap!
marcela hayden. i don‚Äôt know how i would get buisness done with out quickbooks, and the app on the go makes it possible for my family to run our buisness and grow in success. thank you quickbooks
. can do a lot quickly. like most apps doesn't allow you to do everything you can do on full site. great for adding invoices on the go.
glitchy and horrible, like everything intuit makes. i'm a quickbooks proadvisor and have worked with quickbooks for several years with many companies. my advice to businesses and individuals is always the same start looking for something better, it's out there. intuit has horrible customer care and constant software issues that make simple tasks very tedious.
multiple currencies. it should support multiple currencies. can't key in expenses that are not in my home currency
. does what i'm looking for.
please fix. we use quickbooks constantly. it has enabled us to grow at a much faster rate, helped us keep our books in order, and allows us to take online payments easily. however, the recent update has been causing the app to close unexpectedly and also has many other glitches. please fix intuit. we are not hating on quickbooks, but this is the worst update we have ever seen.
does what it needs to do. a little clunky, but then again, i'm expecting a lot from it.
owner. i have been quite impressed! small owneroperator, able to send invoices, estimates, et al. from my trucklove it!
great app. the app takes a bit to get used to but once you've played with it a bit it's very simple to navigate, update bank transactions and so on
sync. why is the app taking forever to sync and most of the time says unable to sync? every week i am having to delete the app and start over for all of the files to download. refreshing within the app does nothing. with all of this said, i love the desktop version.
no longer works on ipad. this app is no longer functioning as of the most recent update. it used to work on the ipad. the camera feature is difficult to use when trying to take a picture of receipt. it doesn't allow me to record payments any longer. please fix.
"won't open. download twice. when i try to log in says i ""need to make payment or my account has been canceled"", which isn't true. i open it on my laptop just fine and have automatic payments. what gives?!!"
loved the app until banking disappeared. i mainly use my computer to do most of our accounting but loved having the app so i could accept banking transactions during short periods of downtime thereby keeping our bank balance up to date all the time. then today i went to catch up on accepting transactions and banking has totally disappeared from the menu. help! what happened? i deleted and reinstalled the app to no avail.
great software. i have come to really like quick books online. quoting, invoicing, reports and my personal favourite... it links with your bank account to automate expense inputs. you set the rules once and the next time a similar transaction appears in your linked bank account it automatically categorises the transaction for you, just hit 'add'. saves me so much time and effort and to me it's fast becoming a business tool i simply wouldn't be without.
why the love. app just doenst work well  slow and just not a great experience.
. app don't update with bank account need to use desk top
". made an payment 3 days ago and still getting an error ""subscription error"" ereceipt sent. update, it's been 5 days and i'm still locked out of my account after payment was made. quickbooks has offered to transfer payment method directly to them. google play informed me that quickbooks refuses to refund my subscription, while quickbooks denies that that is the case. fyi been a quickbooks user for 3 years now, and never had an issue, til now."
. quickbooks is not stable as it should be and regarding support and response they are very lazy even basic business options are not available like we cannot see the prices in products and services etc
cannot perform some basic banking.. after two years of waiting for the app to be capable of making deposits, it still cannot. that certainly seems like a very fundamental process.
overall ok. if you have an issue good luck getting a hold of customer support. freezes up at least once a week and sometimes i can‚Äôt get into my invoices. for what i am paying for i expect more
quickbooks online accounting software.. this app is not a doubleentry system accounting app, but rather a singleentry bookkeeping in which you only need to log each transaction of income or expense once, in the way quicken and other check writing software programs work,
amazing. east, fast and quick to learn. highly recommended
. this app has one major flaw in my view. my bank transactions do not update unless i go through the website and update it there. this is probably the only reason i have this app. this is very annoying and i have contacted quickbooks about this issue and they are not helpful. they tell me to go to the website and update it there! would be a great app if they fix this issue.
. no option to cancel subscription! don't subscribe!
. signed up to app. no clear pricing. my invoice had vat numbers all over it but i'm not vat registered. seems impossible to take vat number off invoices. customer service very slow and hard to get though to. no tel number.
great app. if the sales history chart can show more than one year will be perfect ( at least 2 yrs )
less than useless. this app does not interface enough of the information from the desktop version. reports are raw numbers and can‚Äôt pull up any supporting information. p&l is worthless. the desktop version seems to miss the point of accounting software. ie making all your information easy to input then easy to analyze in reports. this does neither. qbpro etc was far easier to navigate without the slick graphics and colors. aaaaaargh!
couldn't be more useful. i should have been using this a long time ago. now i can keep up on the go. replaced my word search game when it comes to killing time, and the best part is i'm productive.
"cool expenses feature allows upload of receipt  needs croppdf tool. one of the best parts of the app is the ""expenses"" feature, which allows you to enter all of the details of an expense on the go, including the expense account, how you paid (credit card, etc), and any memodescription of the transaction. i'd like to see the image upload function in expense allow for cropping, and even better, auto pdf conversion with cropping, like the camscanner app"
. invoices can't add cost except discounts to my invoices using my s4 phone.
useless app. takes forever or even never to load
. it doesn't get any better than this!
do not sign up using the app. signing up from the app store restricts how you can use quickbooks online. you will not be able to change basic setting like email address or password. sign up from a desktop. then you can login to the app later.
be warned about quickbooks. this is not software. it‚Äôs ransomware. every two or three years they make it break and force you to upgrade. the upgrade is the same price as buying it new. the online version is just as bad. when i started using it it was $15 a month and now it‚Äôs $40 a month. be smart and don‚Äôt become a slave to intuit company.
. after some training it is clear that quickbooks is an invaluable tool for business. after using other cloud invoicing software who have either not covered my needs or have closed down i would hope that qb will be around for the long haul . downgraded by 1 star because the recipt capture isnt quite as good as another app i had .
tons of bugs and glitches. there are lots of glitches and lack of features in this app. the vendor transaction history is spotty, many vendors and missing history all together. profit and loss report doesn‚Äôt scroll. can‚Äôt see the true checkbook register of checks that are written out but haven‚Äôt yet cleared. it‚Äôs really not very good.
excellent tool for my biz. since i got this app on my phone i hardly need to go to the office, or open my laptop. love it!
a little awkward.... it has the functionality but the ui is awkward. it's also very difficult joggling between the different expense accounts.
. great app & software. very helpful. would be nice to be able to keyword search within all estimatesinvoices.
great costumer service. i hope that they improve the app but so far so good. very satisfied with the product.
. i love this app easy to track expenses.
not good after update. used to send invoices via email through my phone android before update cannot anymore. called customer service told me to uninstall and reinstall still same problem.. had to buy an ipad in able to send invoices :( horrible!
. can't add items to invoices
"i can' t even register. ""server error "" i've sent emails and "" reported the issue"" but no response. i've used desktop quickbooks for years and was hoping to have the convenience of qbo on my phone. but now i think i'll just start looking for another online program"
. it keeps logging out of my bank, and also deleted a lot of what i logged from last year.. now i dont have the correct information that i need... not very happy with this quickbooks app...
. useful app
login' this app. makes my life so much easier. i can do everything on the go. saves time! love it!
. love being able to do invoices in the field.
. very happy using this app
fair app version, but not good as browser version. i‚Äôm not able to select item groups when creating an invoice. also im not able to enter sku when creating an item. neither im able to search items by sku info... they dont let you set a fixed price for an item group on any version of the software which o find really easy to implement by code which is dumb...
invoice reminder from app. i was hoping to manage my quickbooks account on my ipad like how i use qkb on a laptop, but it seems like on the ipad version it‚Äôs missing a lot functionalities, such as invoice reminder to client. also to set up the invoice reminder. can you please improve this in your next update? thanks.
best app yet. i manage my invoices and customers everywhere this is great. okay for the monthly cost.
very good and getting better!. qbo has been a great addition to our company and has many great features over qb desktop. there are some bugs to work out but i'm very happy so far with the online application.
update make app worthless. thanks for the update that prevents me from sending invoices.
. malfunctions on every level. did not attach a single receipt picture to the transaction. brought in the bank accounts and scrambled them. even on the desktop deposits are expenses and you cannot edit them
. this app is now horrible, it was great up until latest update and now i am unable to run my business using this app. very frustrating when an app takes steps backwards please help????
. great app, very ready to track income and expenses. making and tracking invoices is so easy even easier then on the computer, reports and everything is really easy to access and track.
new to qb on line. brilliant package but did need support on getting the data i migrated over sorted. but worth the monthly charges. great job quick books.
different. this is so different than qbo that it renders itself useless. i cannot rely on it for any accurate information. the only feature that is good is the receipt capture.
. great app for business!
exactly what i need. the app combined with the online system does exactly what i need it to do. i can invoice clients as soon as i've left their premises, no more trying to keep a record and doing the paperwork later. invoice matching and bank data feeds make reconciliation so easy. this has reduced the amount of time i spend on my accounts significantly. goodbye sage, hello qb online. happy customer.
. downloaded app twice when i tried to login error message continually read i didn't have a quickbooks subscription. was never allowed to access app features.
quickbooks online. works well once you get use to the change from the desktop program.
great help. i love technology.
crashing constantly. crashes nonstop. i get two entries in and then crash. sick of it. come on intuit.
great app. so easy to use.
awesome app. i was hesitant going to the monthly subscription, but it has been awesome always having access to my business account. the app looks and works just like the desktop app on my mac.
. great app to keep your business accounting done on the go.
great app really does work for my business. really easy to do my accounts and invoices.
. helpful app. makes doing my books a lot quicker and more simple.
works good but. haven't been able to email invoices for over 2 months now.. what's up wit that??
normal. g√ºzel bir uygulama ama raporlama eksik
android user. would give it 5 stars if product button was available as it is on apple. great app, easy to use.
. i dislike it ,zoho books much better than this. bcoz i am not able to add my company logo, not even able to edit my invoice number, not even to able edit my invoice columns. i wasted my money.
. fantastic app for keeping my expenses up to date on the go and much more!
. great app..
crapapp. quickbooks program is nice though the company's blatant lack of interest in the osx platform baffles me... this app is basically worthless and does not update to changes made online four weeks ago... they have light years to go before this app is worthy of being used...
. just wish you could attach receipts before accepting a bank transaction.
adding expenses. as compared to other programs such as freshbooks, quick books fails to be quick. it takes twice as long to take a photo of the receipt and input the vendors name. qb please make it easier to input expenses!!
. garbage, won't let you delete your account. it took hours to finally be able to delete email and account, save yourself the hassle and dont download it.
. this is garbage
. easy to operate and great functionality
. so quick and simple!
great!. the ipad qb app works great! as a plus the support and development people are very respectful and helpful when it comes to suggestions to make the app even better. to be able to be completely mobile for a small business means you can be more efficient and get paid faster. the only thing the app is lacking is signature capture and then it will be everything you need and there will be no need for apps like invoiceasap.
paid for itself in one hour. after a long, frustrating search for a robust but simpletouse accounting platform for my growing fitness business, i came across quickbooks and have been exuberant ever since. my invoices go out on time, expenses go in live, and it even tracks my inventory. paid for itself in the first hour. highly recommend.
all of my clients love it!. the ease of use is fantastic. i love that i can quickly load multiple accounts. the qbo app makes my job so much easier because my clients love tracking expenses and sending invoices on the go!
thanks for coming up with this app.. perfect!
excellent accounting software. exactly meets my needs as an ecommerce professional. the reports are limited to pl and balance sheet, but that's is the heart of what you need. i've had it over 2 years now and love it.
making life simple. best way to run your business.
great app. this app has been a life saver for organizing my small business. i can track all of my finances as i go without worrying about carrying recipes and forgetting things. i highly recommend this to anyone is business.
works great for me!. this app is very convenient and easy to use. my business is not complex so it handles all of my needs quite nicely.
. try to subscribe to take cc payments got denied because of the service we sell. we are a sports league that take payments from teams and players. well gotta go with square i guess.
owner. great app to take of of business anywhere i'm at!
. i like the apps easy access but it truly suck because nothing is accessable properly. writing an estimate or invoice on this app is not possible. not properly anyway. its really not pleasant either going online via cellphone because it zooms in and out improperly. its very frustrating. as for quickbooks via laptop i love it. quickbooks has truly made my life much easier and way more organized. but the app needs to be fixed and also online via cellphone bugs.
great app. i am running a smal business llc for a tattoo parlor, great app for even simple tasks. definitely worth the money, and i wouldn't use anything else.
the app needs work. the web based service is great, but the app needs work. the tool i need (journal entries) are not available through this app, so it's not very useful.
could not run a business without quickbooks!. i own a pool service. i love how quickly and easily i can enter information on the fly. it‚Äôs just as fast as scribbling a note between customers, and when i get home at the end of the day, it‚Äôs done! as long as i stay on top of my receipts, my taxes are practically done for me at the end of the year.
great app. there is no other app like it. this is probably one of the easiest apps to use and it is very userfriendly. i use it for my business and i have instant access on my iphone. you can send invoices on a moments notice.
. facile √† utiliser, facturation vite direct sur le chantiers.
. limited bank support. no good for personal finance. not many german banks supported.
. last update made my app work. great job! samsung galaxy s2 sprint epic touch 4g.
great app for any small business. this is a well polished app with regular updates and new features being added everyday. *credit card transactions are incredibly simple with the intuit gopayment integration. great job on the app guys keep up the good work!
welshman. love it. simple for me to send estimates & invoices from the field.
. useless app. waste of money. lousy support. subscribe at your own risk. i am cancelling mine
pretty basic and useless. can't do a lot of things. when i'm on the road and away from my laptop i really need to be able to do more stuff. can't customize any reports at all other than by date. can't run reports by location , can't make many edits , can't easily access the data i need. it's very very basic , pretty much a basic overview of your account.
. crashed out. would not set even up account. lame. uninstalled.
nice app!. suits my needs...
can‚Äôt accept transactions. latest update broke ability to match transactions. it‚Äôs like that screen is locked accept buttonsearch or selecting another expense doesn‚Äôt work.
simple, just plain works.... easy to set up, use and send invoices, receive payments and figure out the taxes.
great app. app is great and worked well with my iphone x but just updated to iphone 11 pro mac and app will not open crashes and closes every time please fix
best app for start up company. hands down this app is the best for any size company, once its all set and customized to your company you & your employees will operate more efficiently. take your time to learn it don't be afraid to call customer service they are very friendly and helpful.
. great app
meh... large app, slow and expensive. looks nice but loading times are slow and not all sections display properly on a phone.
. amazing. processing time for invoices is very fast
great app. after a little getting used to, this app works well. we're a small construction company that works two to three jobs all over the southeast. we've used quickbooks desktop for years, but as we've grown, jobs have taken my partners and i to different regions at the same time. qb online app allows us to ensure that all bids are taken care of, and allows us to see who's doing what.
. quickbooks functions very well for someone who has no idea what they're doing. support is very helpful when needed.
limited options. i love the app but would l like to be able to fully edit or create new customers and vendors in this app. although it is possible, it isn't as detailed compared to the online desktop version.
slow.. not was easy as before. not much function as before. some new function was not useful
fantastic product overall. the mobile app gets about 3 stars but desktop version is 2nd to none. overall love quickbooks and it has helped my business. although mobile app not as good, it's nice to have on the go when i need info on prior jobs out in the field. what i don't like about mobile app is that it won't automatically put next invoice number like the desktop version, that would be a nice fix!
. absolutly a must have for any biz owner. really an easy & amazing app. takes your company to the next level with ease.
terrible. this app has so many problems. it will freeze up and the only way to fix it is to delete he app and download it again. i wii ok old not recommend.
19.11.2 awful update. first thing i noticed was there is no search bar for customers, so i have to scroll through thousands of customers to find the one i‚Äôm looking for. secondly, i had hoped that we‚Äôd be able to view estimates and invoices in landscape mode to see them better, nope. then, when i tried to navigate back to the main customer list, there‚Äôs no back button! this version was nowhere near ready to be released.
great apps. like it!
. great app
it's ok. useful app.. i can't figure out how to open the other companies that i can access on the desktop.
so glitchy!! üò°. quickbooks has the potential to be great. but this app is so, so glitchy! have constant problems with it and i'm really getting to the point of giving up and going back to sage. every time a problem is sorted, a new one pops straight back up. if they could employ some decent tech guys and get things working properly, this would be brilliant.
freelance business functions like agency. this app is brilliant. i can check the status of invoices, p&l's, reference invoices, and client trends. best business app i have on my phone!
missing key funtions. app is great for billing and reviewing information. only function i see missing the would give this app a 5 star rating is it doesn't allow for time entry's to track employee times per job.
delaware business owner. kingdom building services kingdombs.com makes my job ten times easier and gives me a professional image when billing my clients and it also gives me more time to focus on my business.
great. works great, love the app
pathetic. so i have quickbooks, a banking transaction fails, they straight away stop you from using quickbooks, what a unprofessional outfit this is.
quickbooks online app needs lots of work still. the basic problem is it‚Äôs way too slow no matter where i am. usually end up just going through the internet. they are always changing things !üò°
ease of use app. loving to use app on phone writing invoices.
easy to use. simple setup easy to use self explanatory excellent for those on the go and still be able to run your bussiness a+++
. the app does not work on any android tablet. works on my android phone but, not on any of my four tablets. will be cancelling our subscription if not fixed soon.
. great! i like the ability of generating an invoice without a computer.
. useless app. can't integrate one of the biggest bank of australia (cba) with this app. support is just forwarding issue from one team to other. wasted almost one hour on the phone. solution is to forward the issue to next level. there are three companies under my account with same name. cannot delete company. how app allow to create three identical names?? wast of time and money.
was great but can't add expense. i used this app all the time yet now i can't add expenses and take a photo of receipt. something has changed help intuit.
please add a ‚Äútransfer‚Äù option on app. overall good app but would like to have a transfer option on the mobile app i find myself having to login to the desktop version just to transfer amounts between my accounts. also, someone please find a way to mark estimates as ‚Äúreadseen‚Äù by the customer just like the invoices do. ipad version needs help; jumps around too much
easy to use. easy to learn and use. nice to set up. help is always there if needed.
zero stars new version is junk. i used this app several times a day. i run my business on this app. since april 10th i cannot access my data. my business is suffering and intuit cannot fix it. i still have to pay. tech support at intuit  quickbooks recommended i switch to a android. (i doesn't work on my iphone or ipad) i really do not want to invest in new hardware. stay away from intuit they do not care and offer no solutions.
. a joke, support can't resolve any issues
buggy. since updating to the latest version i can‚Äôt view invoices from the home screen or even update and send invoices from the invoices screen. hire some competent engineers.
love this app. i have a small bookkeeping business. i love that i can create invoices on the fly usually in less than 5 mins. i can also send the invoice via email as soon as it's saved. very easy to use app if you have quickbooks online
more harmonisation needed.. i find myself, more often than not, logging in to the desktop version. bank updates are very ‚Äúhit and miss‚Äù particularly early morning.
. love this app!!! it makes business easy!
waste of resources. so you have just put out an update saying how exciting that you have changed the layout and fonts... big whoop!! how about getting the program right first. as in the features that the web version do. bundled items can‚Äôt be seen or edited in the app you have to log into the web interface. etc etc. posting a premium rate per month yet you can‚Äôt add basic features. priority people!! oh wow a new font .... pfffft! :(
awesome app. i love the app so much, but if can add more function n reports in mobile app then is really perfect:)
. fantastic overall experience. easy and convenient to use
good program. wish i could see if my estimates were ‚Äúviewed‚Äù, like my invoices.
categorize expense. useful. would be better if it can scan the photo and also categorize expenses.
. trial no thanks $12.99 per month, no thanks one time will be ok but not monthly
. horrible, did not notify of subscription issue. data entered not commited to database. double charged my credit card. terrible customer service (james refusing a last name or initial from customer care) experience, nothing resolved. no response from error logs. called and even gave control of my computer. never did intuit offer any fix. ongoing issues over 6 months damaging my business.
awful. iphone app pretty much unusable in the real world. always wants to be signed in each time you open it, touch id feature doesn't work. today it's complaining the app needs to be updated before i use it, it then directs me to the app store where it shows i already have the latest version!
freezes. freezes when saving a new client. app is useless.
. awesome app
crashes upon opening. do not install. keep your prior version until they fix this. upon updating the app no longer will open. i called quickbooks and they said it must be a known issue then.
perfect and time saving. now i can invoice my clients from my phone when i'm with them and i can classify my transactions each time i have to wait, directly from my phone!
. i love this app easy to track expenses.
bugs!. so many bugs with this! i just rated it before and it‚Äôs popped up again asking me to rate. and i could go into so much more, however i‚Äôm only using this until next year. it‚Äôs shocking. i have just sent 3 invoices, the clients have received them, but they are not showing up in the app.
update crashed. i have all of my quickbooks point of sale ipads that cannot open the app since the update! we have all had to resort to computers and phones to run our business! you may want to consider this before you join up with quickbooks! they are notorious for problems relating to their quickbooks online.
great app. i have no complaints.
. you are loosing users. i also cann't login. please give me possible way to sign up.
very nice.. very helpful considering that is cloud app. i work with it everywhere a go.
easy. i have found this app very easy to use. being able to tap into your invoicing system when out on a job. it enables me to issue an invoice same moment the job is finished and emailed to my customer stood in front of me, that way my customer has a paperless invoice and can pay you right away. saves time!
". made an payment 3 days ago and still getting an error ""subscription error"" ereceipt sent"
work in progress, work not yet completed. very convenient and functional tomorrow to add expenses and receipts on the go. however only expenses not bills or other random transactions can be accessed through the mobile app. hoping intuit sees the feedback and that all transactions available including bills to be accessed on the mobile app. please add bills to the mobile apps.
. this software is extremely easy to use and worth the subscription. i started my business last october and i have no interest in switching. cheers apollo butler c.e.oowner of hornet waste management.
great app. easy to use and very helpful
receipt should be easier. i need to take the pictures first and upload them to qb it used to take the picture in the qb.
. easy to use! great for keeping track of expenses. especially for my small business.
so far so good.. love the app. i think it's great any time i can give an estimate, invoice on the road. thanks.
problem in showing reports. first of all i would like to say that it is a very good accounts managment software online but there are some problems which is faced by me as compare to the tally software like showing reports and many more and i have complained for that to customer care representative thanks regards muhmmad faisal hussain outflank trading pvt. ltd. 9999926273
. easy way to reach my client balances and send proposals and invoices and collect payment.
. would give 5 if... i could view an invoice after it has been paid. the information is incomplete
. how long has this app been out and it still doesn't work? i can update my bank feeds just fine on the website and pc version but the android app always errors out. clearing cache or reinstalling won't help. i get the same error on my phone and tablet. on my other tablet it just crashes to home screen completely. why am i paying for this again??
convenient app!. good app, just wish it would migrate previous category info for existing payees. it would be 5 stars then.
quickbooks online. the app can be frustrating at times to use, not enough flexibility. can't make up its mind wether to ask me to sign in or use finger print login. need option to control where deposits go.
. tr√®s utile, mais surtout tr√®s complet!
. sucks. can't create invoices easily. much like quick books online it has become to complicated....after years of both i'mm switching
. app never up to date with website or it does not show you everything you can see online. sometimes you can't even see anyone's invoices or estimates. always an issue.
. very good app
love it. customers are paying online. so much easier for my business. great app.
horrible ever since update!!. this last update completely ruined the app.
intuit quickbooks. software
i love quickbooks online. i love quickbooks online & my accountant does also. this app is really good for doing your expenses on but as far as invoicing i still do it on the computer. it's very handy for a small business. the fact you can enter an expense, take a picture of the receipt & go on your merry way. i'm sold.
very helpful. make managing my bussines much easier. good app.
. ive tried to cancel this and followed instructions to cancel and it keeps taking money out of my account !!! i just want it deleted and my money refunded !!!
. me gusta, tal vez deberia tener version en espa√±ol.
great as an assistant to the desktop version.. i've found this app to be a great mobile partner to the full desktop (or online) version. there's a couple functions that aren't available in the app but everything you do need is easily available. i can't connect my bank account because my (non us) bank isn't listed but being able to input expenses as they happen is a great way of keeping updated accounts. reconciliation is a breeze afterwards. it's a great app.
. origionally i wanted to use this app for easy application of spreadsheets and invoices, unfortunately when everything wasn't working out for me, i decided to pull the plug and cancel my subscription. unfortunately, it is hard to get a cancellation and stop the reoccurring payments and it has brought me here. i would recommend that you guys make it easier for others to manage your subscription accounts.
owner. terrible , there is no estimates workable , also 85 % of desktop does not show i have been in desktop for years and wanted to use both not any more
very handy. great to keep track of invoices and call outs. very easy to use
crashing on ios13 please update asap!. crashing on ios13 please update asap!

. won't update data. data is 137 days old and counting. refreshes don't help and uninstallingreinstalling is a waste of time. thanks for nothing.
qb on the go.... love it, love it, love it. this is a great app for someone on the go. no longer am i held hostage by my pc. now instead of going to the bank, the bank comes to me. love it, love it, love it!
. everytime wont open says error etc etc
nice tool. i like this tool a lot but it could use more links. you need to add the ability to add to the time sheet service. i upgraded to use that on all my business phones on the field and low and behold support lied to me and said it was possible. so i upgraded and guess what it's not in the app.
complete waste of time.. 100% completely useless and a total embarrassment. in the year 2013 quickbooks is the only company left that cannot figure out how to make their full product work on an ipad. please fire your entire tech department and hire a high school kid with skills.
ouickbooks. setting up this quickbooks app is a joke , the system does not work and customer support has an attitude that is not willing to help!
decent....but needs work. the mobile app is laid out decent and does work well for the most part. biggest problem i have is you cannot access product quantities or make any purchase orders with the mobile app. need to fix that.
jordan hugo ,. i'm young and in business , only small but this app is perfect for tracking my expenses and sending quotes off. highly recommend.
i like it. i like it good app
perfect for my business. i like that i can access any information quickly. very easy to use for everyone. the invoicing, payments, and sales reports are perfect for a small business. my only wish is that quick books small business would integrate easily with quick books online. maybe soon this will happen ?
. loving it, great app and works great
horrible. this app and their customer service is terrible.
. userfriendly, can create bills and estimation from mobile app too
totally useless. as a long time quickbooks user i thought this might be for me. after many frustrating hours trying to figure it out and the seeming absence of help i‚Äôm just going to delete it and cancel my subscription. as i said a total waste of time
very convenient!. this app has saved me on so many occasions. being able sending invoices and estimates onthego is awesome.
does not work or match online version.. does not work or match online version. we cant make it accurate or work correctly. do not use.
the best. buy an ipad. shred up your paper estimatesinvoicing. stop using pens. download this app. holy crap i've been in business 4 years and feel stupid after downloading this. plus u look awesome w an ipad. plus everything's stored forever.
can not do custom invoice numbers. the app can not do custom invoice numbers. i have had the app for two months and paying the monthly fees and have not been able to send out my first proper invoice. i have asked support and they come back with instructions to go to certain settings that do not exist on the app.
sweet business app. fantastic app for running my business when in remote areas or on the go!! no glitches with the app either!
. good interface, easy to navigate
keeps getting more user friendly!. the new video tutorials make it easy to learn. the portability of switching between the mobile app and the desktop version online is a priceless feature, thanks for all of your hard work!
great software & online support. quickbooks support is great
. terrible for receiving payment rude staff. my funds is being held for over six days now. bad business practices, no you will not receive your funds in 23 business days. don't even try using to receive payments.
awsome software. that is a great app but still far away from the desktop program .... limited access for a lot futures it's ok but not wow for the yearly cost
easy to use. love this app, easy to use.
can‚Äôt enter, view or edit bills. this app would be great, except you can‚Äôt enter or edit bills. workaround would be to login to website, but then what‚Äôs the point of having the app.. just use the website for full functionality
amazing app. so great to use! still missing few features but gets the job done
highly recommended. it saves me a lot time from working on invoices and so. it help me on whenever i need it, i just have to take out my phone and i'm able to use what i need to.
. very efficient and works great on my tablet.
". update 101619: still useless as constant login issues persist, why use the app if i constantly have to uninstallreinstall + clear cachedata. constantly unable to use app  login, keep getting ""temporarily unavailable"" !!!"
missing some features. should have all the capabilities that the web site has, no reason not too. i can print from my phone so why not print my payroll too? at least viewrun payroll.
works and convenient. easy way to enter sales and expenses. i've had no problems with this app.
new user; i love it. i am amazed at what all i can accomplish with my iphone while traveling. best app on my phone.
. does everything a small business could ask for!
. really nice
. app wont log in to my samsung phone, tried a number of different things including deleting data and cache as well as uninstallinstalling it. i know my account is fine because it works on my apple phonecomputer with no issues. please help!
. the best biz app...
no purchase orders. for years now quickbooks has withheld the ability to create purchase orders through the mobile app. this is a huge issue for our company and it is quite frustrating that qb has willfully omitted this feature. i wish there was a way to convince qb to change course on this decision...
. great app for the on the go contractor. i can invoice, send a receipt from anywhere.
no multi currency = useless. i enabled multicurrency on my quickbooks account, which you can not revert once applied. and now i find that when i log into the app, it won‚Äôt show transactions or customers that use anything other than my base currency. useless. utterly useless.
app doesn‚Äôt recognize credentials. this app worked well for me until the most recent update. now i cant login, says can‚Äôt find the account with this emailpassword. this is very annoying since i travel frequently without a laptop. now i‚Äôve lost the ability to access my accounts via the app.
. don't fill up your information for free trial it's easy to set up for free trial. they doesn't have options in app for unsubscribe your free trial. you have to reach them every day for unsubscribe your free trial. if you not satisfied from app then start call them before 5days, they will not answer your call till your free trial not get expired. be careful before you sign up.
work in progress, work not yet completed. very convenient and functional tomorrow to add expenses and receipts on the go. however only expenses not bills or other random transactions can be accessed through the mobile app. hoping intuit sees the feedback and that all transactions available including bills to be accessed on the mobile app. please add bills to the mobile apps.
great program, an asset to my business!. great program and very versatile. would only like to make 1 request. please provide link for iphone users to copypaste invoice into text message. currently need to email myself and copypaste link. very cumbersome process thank you.
doesn‚Äôt always work. says it can‚Äôt show details on invoices. annoying.
login will not allow me to paste my password. i use quickbooks online, so i use a very strong password that is stored in an app (1password). it would be extremely annoying to hand type a 25 character random password into this app. and i'm unwilling to compromise my security for my online financial data. therefore this app is totally useless to me.
very helpful. this app does everything we need to organize our finances for our cleaning business.
. the app is ok but it is super buggy
please support iphone x & faceid. please support full screen resolution on iphone x and faceid
. this app has been great for be and my small business it helps me to be able to stay on track of my invoices in and out at the touch of my screen.
. loved it, but acting up again. when i add something to an invoice (on s8) the hit done, the refreshed invoice lines are all out of order and duplicated. uninstalled and reinstalled, still doing it. please fix.
. not bad a bit confusing at first
. don't waste your time with other apps
. everything you could ever need to manage a business. financials at a glance and indepth, invoicing made easy, automated payroll, and so much more. 2 employees couldn't replace this app.
. great app, easy to use !
poor service. stopped connecting to my bank account so can‚Äôt link transactions and service and support is terrible and cannot work out why. won‚Äôt be using again and will be cancelling.
. garbage. doesn't even have a spot to track vehicle expenses. in the self employed version you can. but you can't track hst. would be nice to have one option for everything.
app issue. i've been using the quickbooks app for over 6 months and it worked fine. now, for the past week the app will not let me access my company data or the data is incorrect after multiple reinstalls. this is very aggravating and qb's customer support stated it's an ios issue. please correct this issue asap. thank you
. solved my problem with today's update patch... thanks quickbooks team üëç
worthless on ios13. out of all the apps i have, this is the only one that wasn‚Äôt ready for ios13. it was worthless during the entire public beta process & i was hoping with the actual ios 13 release, it would be updated. not the case, still worthless. doesn‚Äôt work on my iphone or ipad. it was the convenience of having quickbooks on the go that sold me in the first place. not the case anymore.
great app. far easier to use than desktop quickbooks. great software
major flaw  can‚Äôt add receipts to expenses. no dropbox or photo option. they advertise this system as super easy and convenient. you can‚Äôt add receipts from photos or dropbox. that makes the ‚Äòadd attachment ‚Äò pretty much pointless. i take a picture of an expense receipt but 0 way of adding it ... seriously. who designed this app.???
. great app. very easy to use
interstate_g. i‚Äôm a young entrepreneur. no degrees and some college classes in my background. when i say that this app is easy and straightforward forward, helps me run my business, and does most of the work. easy is an understatement. if accounting is your barrier in your buisness look no harder cause qb is the answer.
new version is slick. adding items in the new ui is simple and concise.
cis unfriendly. useless if your a contractor or subcontractor. if your in the construction industry, this app is useless. you cannot create cis invoices which renders this app useless.
down graded. i down graded to qb online. it appears it was released about a year too soon. nothing but frustration from day one. the phone app is all but useless.
. i have had this app on my phone for years. i tried opening it and i was told to update the app. so i did. now it will not open. it just keeps telling me to update. i have uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it still does not work. my business is important and this makes me very mad
very unstable!. downloaded the new version but the app consistently crashes just after login. real shoddy development and testing by intuit.
updates have made it horrible. i love using the online version. the august updates however have tanked the app. it is no longer sharing information between my iphone, ipad, and mac. the sorting feature of estimates is now gone ( pending, accepted, closed) it only shows in last changed order, not good when working with 3 month or longer history. on a positive note, i do like the photo modification for the iphone. it no longer adds to my photo album, just imports to quickbooks.
. horrible customer service and support. do not use there merchant services
. excellent software, especially since my accounting is done offsite. qb is always improving it for ease of use. very happy with it, now going on 4 years usage.
. please make a simple way of uploading a photo to an invoice (instead of through create note option).
convenient. as a consultant who spends most of my time out of the office this comes in handy for invoicing on the run. would be good if it was possible to add billable hours for a customer without creating an invoice (i invoice on a fortnightly basis so have to create an invoice and edit it daily then change the date of the invoice when it is finally issued). customisation of the widget would also be welcome.
super & excellent apps. very user friendly application . i would recommend this software to other people
useless since update. the last update brings a gorgeous splash screen. i know this because i see it dozens of times each day since i have to log in every time i open the app! completely useless now.
error. error showing while signing in
. makes my whole world a million times faster and easier. thank you quick books from me and my family
. useless app. not user friendly. waste of money. major disappointment
. i am blessed for all the riches that i have. and this app is one of them
top notch. awesome! don't know what i would do without it. i guess put everything on paper lol.
. absolutely awful and useless in every single way. beyond awful and useless. everything is hard to do. everything takes forever to get done. it always crashes and has constant glitches.
works great. works great for my small business. not sure why there are bad reviews, qbo keeps up with my customers information, invoices, and estimates. very easy to use. now on this last update, i did have to uninstall and reinstall on my andriod phone, but within 5 minutes i was back up and running.
worse and worse with every update.. the more recent the update, the worse this app runs. worked great until they changed to a new platform and now it's slower then ever. to logging in or saving pictures out in the field, it takes an additional 20 mins on the job site just waiting for quickbooks.
. love this app.
. great app friendly to use can create receipts on the spot. i am a mobile repair service and i run all my sales thru this app.
. easy to maneuver love this app.
. can't add expenses. my husband has the mobile app on his iphone where we can add expenses. i do not see this option on android. bothersome.
great support. we use the app almost exclusively to keep our business mobile. recently had an issue and contacted customer chat to get it resolved. they had me screen record it happening and said they would push to engineering for fix. honestly didn‚Äôt expect anything fast but they fixed the issue and included it in the new patch. it‚Äôs been about a week or less so a big thank you the support teams for getting it fixed and getting us back to normal.
mohammed salman 6s. superb app all ledger's are in just my pocket my request is to app developer suppliers options suppliers balance
. good app i enjoy this app but i do wish that it had the employee section. you can not clock hours for an employee.
just started with it.. can i attach a file to an invoice that i create with the app? i don‚Äôt see the option and we need to be able to do this or this appprogram won‚Äôt work for us.
jl. great for small business on the go.... got it sync with square and it makes it even better. great job!!!
great app!!. this app helps me stay connected to my office while being out on jobsites. i can check customer invoices from previous jobs to see what process was done. great app.
o melhor!. excelente!!! minha ferramenta de gest√£o financeira.
limited, extremely. i need to be able to edit inventory on a regular basis, add it, etc. please continue to improve. good for reference on the road, but if i have to do any changing, i gotta break out my laptop... i'm on a galaxy note4.
newest update issue. hi, i love this app and it normally works great. when i updated my ipad, i can no longer take payments because of a weird glitch that keeps the total amount $0 even if the item is $25. i emailed with screenshots. giving you a heads up to look for that. at the moment, i can‚Äôt process any payments. it‚Äôs frustrating! thank you.
. can't even get started. created an account and tells me i have 30 days but then tells me i have no subscription whenever i attempted to log in.
. great app for on the go invoices
buggy ios13. error email too long amount to high invoice can't add customers via contact address book goes dark probably a lot of other issues .
excellent app. moved from xero to qbo and couldn't be happier
finally p&l support. very useful now with this feature. waited a long time.
great app for business. love this app. great for my work as i'm mobile 90% of the time. certain features that i can't access on the app easily than on the desktop.
. as a quickbooks user anytime i'm in need of the app it's been brilliant. missing a few key features, but as i mainly stick to the web version it's fantastic when needed
. pathetic for indian users. quick book online for android not supported fir india. there website never successfully register for trial..so poor user experience.
don't make me log in repeatedly. it's an app.. ux execution for this company is repeatedly abysmal. i have an account. i download the app. i activate thumbprint authentication. and they repeated log me out and have me sign in again as though i'm a new user to a web site. this kind of crap ux plagues this app in the most annoying spots.
still can‚Äôt attach a receipt. even after the most recent update, i still can‚Äôt attach a photo of a receipt. i can select the photo from my library, but the save button has been missing since the last ios update.
doesn't work properly!!!!!. doesn't work properly!!!!! you should fix all bugs before u sell your service, especially then it's about money and business, stay away if u want save you time!!!
great user interface. i like using quickbooks online because it is simple and effective. easy to use and uncluttered.
app keeps crashing. keeps saying the session is over when i sign in and logs me out
can't log in on nexus 5x. i haven't been able to log in on my nexus 5x for 23 months (maybe longer). i can get to the login screen and put in my credentials, but when i click next it errors. tried uninstalling and reinstalling. even installed a qb app update recently if i remember correctly. still can't log in. tried emailing info to support, but i still have the same problem. i can login from my computer or ipad mini just fine.
. great app!
unreliable.. great when it works right; frustrating when it doesn't. older data from desktop version seems to be corrupted in mobile version. when it becomes stable and reliable, it will be nice asset. at the moment, however, it's annoying too frequently.
best app for any business. i'm a musician and this app helps keep track of all my gigs and insures proper payment!
great customer support. when they updated the app they changed how bank deposits are recorded. it used to be from the home screen you could tap the plus sign and in addition to entering a debit you could add a deposit. they took that away and i was confused. but their customer support responded quickly to my review explaining that they had moved it to the top three bars. i‚Äôm solved! and i really appreciated them responding.
simply the best. so simple to use and makes more time free for myself
app doesn‚Äôt open. app doesn‚Äôt open on the new iphone pro
. i keep getting a error that says unable to view payment because it includes finance charges. very frustrating when you can't view invoices.
the convenience of this service is worth every penny. without this app, i would often forget to log in after a job and record my time on an invoice. now, i can record billable time, field notes and expenses as i perform them, and email the bill to my customer upon my departure. the only thing i would like to see added is a way to record mileage as miles.
1 step forward  2 steps back. for the most part, the app functions correctly after finally resolving the issues with accepting credit cards. now, it wants to download the company information each morning. it is doing it on all the devices and accounts that our company uses. it's very frustrating when we need to quickly pull up a customers information only to be forced to wait for it to redownload all the info. hurry up and wait
just as simple as we could even think !!!!!. this app according to me is best as it's not that complicated and makes my business easy, i've not used any other accounting app so i consider this very easy for any layman who is not very good in accounting. it could have had few more options like individual job closing so to get more accurate and decrease the paper work.
does everything i need!. love it!
quick and easy. it really is.. i love the new qb online.. great job.. the app is awesome
has features the browser doesn‚Äôt. i can see addresses on the client list, and it integrates with maps to get driving instructions
. useful, but doesn't replace desktop so far it will do most of what i need while out in the field. would like it to eliminate the need to use desktop once and for all. i use this daily.
super simple. i love this app! so easy to take pictures and attach receipts to my transactions, send invoices, take payments, sign docs... very easy and simple...love it!
can not save estimates. i'm able to imput items for estimates but error message pops up when i try to save.
just no. the app isnt compatible with the galaxy s7 which is really inconvenient. üëéüëéüëé.
excellent program. üëç
must have for small businesses. this has simplified my life immensely. i no longer have to worry about things falling through the cracks, quickbooks keeps it all in check. solid app, no issues or crashes yet after about 3 months of use.
sales tax calculation is wrong. when creating an invoice, the app does not honor customer's sales tax setting. it applies tax even on customers with tax turned off. please fix asap!!!!
. worst app don't use it. it shows us a very professional look and feel but truth is that it doesn't work in android mobile in india and online version of desktop is totally sucks just because it is very slow. these peoples are making fool of us totally.
sweetness!. clearly...they have small, growing businesses in mind. this app has really brought our company to the next level. we love it!
good app. so far so good
. good app
wow! loving the switch!. it's more than i had ever expected. using square or other solutions or good old fashion checks in the mail are nothing compared to how seamless qbo has made my life. that mac app, ipad app, iphone app and even the apple watch app give me the pulse on our company that i've needed for so long. can't wait to grow into more solutions with qbo!
easy to use. hey it's worth the money easy to understand and help you to keep track of everything access anywhere .this is the future! thank you quickbooks
amazing!. this just made my life much more easier to manage my small business! well done!
don't bother!. except for the cost, i really like quickbooks online. this ipad app is nothing even close and is basically useless.
. doesn't appear to allow access to my projects. otherwise it seems to work well.
needs to fix bugs. i love quickbooks online and the desktop version but their mobile app needs to fix their bugs. i told quickbooks support two months ago that i couldn't email an invoice from the app and they couldn't help me fix the problem then. i still cannot send invoices from my mobile app so it is basically useless to me.
great! but it could be a tad bit better. the app is great and works perfectly fine. just needs to somewhat mirror the desktop view. only use it when i have to or can't get to a computer and all the visuals from desktop view are what catch me. easy to ready everything, maneuver around and get to what i want. app is half that, but other than that, i like it
. user for 2 years, samsung s8, app fails to load now. when it did work, it never showed historical customer transactions. never properly refreshed bank connections oh, you would have to go to the online portal and update first before you could use or see your transactions on this app. i'm pretty fed up at this point with this app, only thing i really wanted to do at this point was use the receipt scanning but i can't even do that now. uninstalled..
"app now totally dead, cannot login at all.. can't login anymore, giving a weird ""suspicious activity detected"" error and refuses to login, running android 5.0. works fine on my pc, osx laptops and ios devices. this is a known problem on android. see this https:community.intuit.comquestions1281477cannotloginmobileapp. still can't create purchase orders on android or ios! that's almost a deal breaker for me. i can search for items while creating invoicesestimates in android  but not ios?"
business handled from my phone. works well, update is even better. can create invoices, print, email, track and reconcile business spending. shows if invoices have been sent ( when emailing) as well as read. would give 5 stars if i were able to record bank deposits with this app. currently customer payments remain in undeposited funds until i log in to the desktop site. also wish i could save time by printing batch invoices. overall very useful, easy way to handle business on the go.
. they said in your invoice that you can cancel anytime and it's not true! it has a glitch and i couldn't cancel it. make me lost two days trying to cancel it and then even charge me the month and did not give back my money. they went from 17 dollars a month to 40 dollars per month! don't never quickbooks
i doesn‚Äôt work for personal finances. i have tried to get my personal finances but failed. this app is meant for business accounting only and there‚Äôs no way of using it work for personal accounting purposes. so, basically this is not the app for individual personal financial accounting. look somewhere else for it if you are looking for something similar to quicken.
keep crashing. after last update keep crashing. new update came just an hour ago still same crash???!!!doesn‚Äôt launch the app. please fix asap pleasseeee
. amazing app
. when it comes to converting an estimate to an invoice or processing transactions, the app experience is excellent and even preferred to the desktop version. smooth and easy to learn.
...and now it doesn‚Äôt load. i depend on my quickbooks app daily. as of yesterday, it doesn‚Äôt load on my iphone 7 running ios 13.3. needs to be fixed please.
excellent online software. i love this system made my job a lot easier my phone is my office
awesome app!. started my business with the start of this app since i'm a mobile mechanic and it's awesome to do quotes and invoices on the fly makes it easier to keep customers
used to love it. it used to work great, but now it crashes and never loads. wished it worked. i like the ability to snap pics of my receipts.
attachment quality is terrible. the quality of the attachments when taking pictures of things like receipts compresses my photos down to almost indistinguishable. i am using a galaxy s4 and the uploaded pictures are 50kb. at least allow me to choose my compression rate. it allows 25 mb attachments. please fix this!
. great app for small business works wonders for me
major flaw. the app ui is pretty good and i really like the interface. the problem is that a lot of my invoices are not even viewable on the app. basically anything that has a delayed charge on it won't show up so there is a major glitch there or something.
top notch program. i use it everyday for business! easy to use and cut my estimating time in half. i can even send estimates from the program. definitely worth the money.
great costumer service. i hope that they improve the app but so far so good. very satisfied with the product.
awesome app. this is a brilliant app. i have all my invoices and expenses at my fingertips. very easy to use and synchs perfectly with qbo on my mac. keeps me on track with daily reminders of overdue invoices. no one gets away with not paying me now.
crashes when entering a sales receipt. i am new to quickbooks and am super frustrated i can‚Äôt enter a simple sales transaction. it crashes every time. disappointing
. keeps crashing when entering receipts. it's infuriating. updated review 6 months later still crashes when splitting an expense. tried deleting the cache. it's useless.
. great app. for on the go. can sync with any device.
. great tool for a service business! create an invoice and get paid all at the job site in one easy app
lots of steps. i like the app but there are lots of steps and it takes me a while. occasionally the transaction doesn't go through. it does update my quickbooks so i like that and it saves my bookkeeper time
good app. overall this is a good app, would be nice to have more features such as gp% per job or integration with credit card payment
very spotty usability. honestly, i love the idea and i love quickbooks online, but this app is usable only like 50% of the time... it always seems to say ‚Äòwe can‚Äôt get all of your (paymentinvoicebanking) details, try again later‚Äô. so all i can use it for is to see profit and loss for the month. would be nice if they could get that stuff fixed!
great app. i have been using quickbooks for about a year now. it's has been a major asset to my business. it made filing my taxes quick and easy too.
slow books. can‚Äôt accept transactions in banking section. sluggish app, end up using the computer more often.
app crashes. this app crashes or cannot save my data on every entry i make. horrible app!!
pool guy. quickbooks forced me to update from our quickbooks mobile windows invoicing system to quickbooks mobile with only five days notice. this was very poorly planned by quickbooks and put us in a bind. however the new quickbooks mobile online system is truly fantastic and offers many more powerful features and ease of accessibility. recommendation: this app needs the ability to create a monthly statement that i can email from my phone to my customers. currently i can only do this from a laptop.
horrible tech support. they couldn't even transfer my desktop file to quickbooks online. after one month they called me at 8pm to say it can't be done.
still needs work. one thing needed i‚Äôd making it easier to change customers info when doing a new invoice for a previous customer but at a new address. i have many customers that own many places and i need to be able to put the address in for each place where the work is done with that same customer and the app doesn‚Äôt allow this to happen.
frustrated. very difficult to make adjustments and when receiving a payment i have not found a way to receive cash as will as a card on the same invoice. frustrated
. good accounting software. use it mainly for invoices.
qbo mobile  love it!. i love having my books at my fingure tips. i can create invoices, record payments on the spot, and get a pedicure all at once! love it!
. since the most recent update i cannot see my dashboard or add expenses to my company. fix it. done all diagnostic steps so this update is invalid. galaxy s10+ here
does what it should. gets more inuitive with every update.. i am in better control of my business than ever.
need to improve!. the sole trader app is great for what i do including logging travel however i am registered for gst and therefore cannot use it. i have to go to the online version and just discovered you have to buy the plus version to link to recommended logbook app. qb you need to provide gst to the sole trader app or at the very least provide the same logbook function for the other qb packages.
". mobile app is full of bugs, recent ""update"" has now made it so my account is unable to sync and wont let me log in. not very useful for my mobile business. tried reinstalling the app, still no luck."
. easy to use onthego as my business is mobile. able to navigate with minimal fuss.
works well so far. i installed the app this month. so far it allows me the flexibility to record transactions on the go. this is a big help.
how did they not see this coming?. quickbooks is currently not working on any update from apple. doesn't work in ios 10, doesn't work on safari 10 on the mac, can't download the mac app! business has been crippled for days. a business app like this needs far better reliability!
great app. the app does everything i need on the run. thanks
easy to use. great app. very happy with it
. this is a easy to use app and makes keeping track of finances easy i'm still having no problems using quickbooks and it just gets easier and easier . and if you need help the team is there , i recommend this especially if you have no real experience u swing an accounting system
. this app is the biggest piece of shut app i've ever used invoice asap is 10 times better yes it will connect with quick books but quick books on this app particularly online sucks dick i would rather have a disc version on my computer then online version whom ever came up with this version should have their hands chopped off
"great app!. this is a really good app for ""handling your business"" from anywhere."
i love it easy to use !!!!. easy to use and easy to navigate!!!
bookkeeper 60. excellent app. would be 5 stars but still has bugs...most notably touch id login.
limited in ipad. will not allow the entering of purchases on account from suppliers when using the ipad app. seems to be more cash based, unlike the version you log on with you pc or imac.
updates that don‚Äôt install. and yet they won‚Äôt a install once again on ios you would think it people would get it
. i met someone with iphone using this app, an he could match & accept bank transactions from his phone. when will android version have this capability?
iphone 11 fail. can‚Äôt get this app open on new phone. was never a problem before!
limited company. absolutely brilliant. allows me to create and send clients invoices no matter where i am. without doubt the best accountsbusiness management system available. so simple to use and effective
very useful!. this app allows me to send clients a sales receipt as soon as they hand me the cash, invaluable when visiting clients.
quickbooks. this app is excellent and the version on my computer is even better save's me hours when quoting well worth the money and it's also good for on site reference
". constantly unable to use app  login, keep getting ""temporarily unavailable"" !!!"
awful program. glitchy... no help at all from customer service, i paid my fee and they used it to open a new account instead of paying for the one i had. ‚Äúunable‚Äù to refund me... i spent three hours on the phone today with three different people, absolutely no help, no service, no one has any idea what the hell they‚Äôre doing, a very poorly run company. disappointed
. love this app!
wow. not ready for prime time. i don't think this has followed through on a single promise it is horribly clunky at importing bank transactions  count on spending hours recategorizing every single transaction you made honestly. it's barely better than a spreadsheet for the price
updates that don‚Äôt install. first of all got up to install and it won‚Äôt
love quickbooks. it's so easy and makes doing business sooooo much easier!
simple and reliable. never quits. wicked easy to use.
broken. i sign in and all it does is take me to a screen that says it isn't quick books mac. the only buttons on the screen either take me to a webpage saying the app isn't quick books for mac or takes me back to sign in.
fire the entire team. worst app. login doesn't work. recovery doesn't work. craptastic adventure
. best program and online service i have ever used.
. as someone starting a small business, i needed a quick and effective way to keep track of receipts, other costs, mileage, as well as sales and track a percentage of my profits that goes to a charity. i love having this easy to use app on my phone so i can input info on the go! highly recommend for the small independent business owner.
unuseable. the developer disabled the ability to paste in your password. i cannot use an app that requires me to spend two minutes pecking in my 28digit password every time i want to use it! enable paste and i will give this app a try.
crashes on ios 13. don‚Äôt install if you are on ios 13. this doesn‚Äôt work. it just crashes.
buggy app. doesn‚Äôt even open, tried many times opening it on my iphone x for weeks. it doesn‚Äôt even open the app and there hasn‚Äôt been an update to fix that for ages. unable to use it on my phone and having to use it on my laptop which i don‚Äôt always have it on hand. please fix this issue.
excellent app. keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
. this app is eady to use and keep all my business expenses in one place!
latest rev still buggy. when adding a new customer, cannot import contact info besides names. address email and phone numbers not automatically being added while accessing phone contacts. also receiving consistent home error message of being unable to access company info.
. terrible...i am still trying to cancel the trial period...i contacted them via phone, email and followed all heir instructions amd nothing...the section to cancel doesnt exit for me ..they keep repeating the same and avoid t9 answer.
. great app
best app. very helpful online support
time saver. i highly recommend this app, specially for small business. quick, easy and in combination with service m8 it's all i need.
frank. this app is amazing. it is exactly what i needed to start my business. it makes it quick and easy to do your estimates, invoices, and keep track of all your accounting needs.
. i was not aware that you needed their main subscription of $25 per month to access this extra monthly charge. also i am still being charged my one month payment for thinking i could use this on my andeoid only and signing up. not impressed for a co.pany i worked with their software for years. now like microsoft, it's a money grab with subscriptions. sad. loved them for years.
ios impacts the rating. it is impossible to fathom that in 2019 i cannot view andor pay sales tax on my ipad whether i use the quickbooks app or via a web browser. and how is it that i cannot enter bills on my ipad? given what intuit charges for qbo and payroll, which we use, this is totally unacceptable.
great improvement over previous versions. previous versions were useless. this finally is an app that is not only useful, but a great productivity tool. had to use the ipad version when splits suddenly stopped working in quickbooks online. discovered the ipad app to now be fully functional.
easy and efficient!. the app serves perfectly to capture transactions on the go, snap a pic and enter amount and accounts then review later if needed on a computer. simple, some people expect this to be fully functional for some reason; if you need a fully functional program then you really should have the appropriate expenses towards computers and software anyways. this app makes the book keeping process easy as cake for clients and the accountant.
great app. app is great and worked well with my iphone x but just updated to iphone 11 pro mac and app will not open crashes and closes every time please fix
very frustrating. this could be great but there are too many bugs. can't switch between users accounts and that should be easy. fix it please!!!
. good app, simple and yet very decent would give 5 stars but the hardware android menu button doesn't do anything. set it to open that side bar, also it needs a speed increase. sometimes it takes over 40 seconds to update. otherwise great app, easy to use. eagerly await updates to this.
entering bills?????. why have intuit decided not to support bill entering on this app?!? it great i can import my paper receipts using the camera, but whats the point if i can't enter as a bill only an expense?!?
slow to respond from time to time .. the app is sometimes slow to respond.
great app. very convenient
logs me off all the time. app is constantly requires entering password even with touchid enabled. not sure what the point of touchid is if a password is required
makes it easy. so glad i decided to go with quickbooks, update daily to keep track of expenses and sales. fantastic for my business.
queers. geysnlesbians
won't work. dumb, have quick books for pc. this gets error after signing in. galaxy tab.
a good idea but not very useful yet. there is not access to the important online reports. there is no access to fx transactions or accounts in a foreign currency. i live overseas and bill my clients in us dollars and as such have no access to client information or us dollars sales and accounts. if the app mirrored the online program it would be great but it doesnt!!
"app doesn't work. after speaking with the help desk the advise i got was ""the app must not compatible with your phone (iphone 6 plus)"". i leave this review as i only signed up with quickbooks to manage my businesses accounts ""on the go"" and it's been a waste of money for this purpose"
works good for me. i use quick books to invoice, put in costs, and see roughly how the company is doing financially. easy to use. i read all reviews but some are not liking it while others do. depends on what your using it for. simple and easy that's what i like.
. this app is just perfect. simple and easy to use and anyone without any accounting background can easily adapt to use it. üëç
easy to use. well set out and easy to use
expenses. you cannot cost expenses to a particular job or client
don‚Äôt purchase from app store. over priced
. solid a love the mobility and ease of use for my small business. just wish i could void or cancel invoices and estimates on the app.
mrs. app will not open after update
. loved it, but acting up again. when i add something to an invoice (on s8) then hit done, the refreshed invoice lines are all out of order and duplicated. uninstalled and reinstalled, still doing it. not working on tablet either. please fix asap.
essential to running my business. this app is very helpful, highly recommended
from bad to worse. going downhill fast, the app version is very restricted. also the price is getting higher, they entice you in with a low start price that then increases once you are locked in. scared to leave as i am unsure what data i will loose
it works most of the time. it‚Äôs useful to have the app but more often i go to the browser site as you can do more on it. the app is good if you just want to record a quick expense and take a photo of the receipt to attach. quickbooks itself is a good accounting package, it‚Äôs just the app needs a bit more functionality.
doesn't sync open bills or invoices. it doesn't show any of my current or closed bills that have been entered for vendors.
great app. dan
very useful, ios 13 login issue however. as the title says. this software, when combined with the website version, can be incredible useful. the layout is good. i use it for work and once you get to know it it‚Äôs pretty good. currently there is an issue logging in with ios 13.
fee increase is a bad deal. fees increased but same services rendered. otherwise it‚Äôs a decent app. i‚Äôm disappointed that they get people to invest all there invoices and history in app and program then up the fees in them nearly double. can‚Äôt trust a company that does that to ya.
. software is meeting all my expectations for my small business needs.
update the update, please.. i love this app. i use it every day, but the new update (4.5, released yesterday) will not let me record payments or save new invoices. it forces me to cancel each time, which doesn't save any changes made. please fix asap.
. what a joke......the sales team are so rude....software is actually pretty good but the attitude of the staff in th sales team have completely put me off using this! i will now be looking elsewhere (fresh books etc).....
gary stanton. this app means i can seem to know what i am doing, it actually works for me.
fix the bugs. this program has many bugs and has connectivity issues. the level of problems with the software is extensive. when the program works correctly it works nicely, but the downtime and glitches greatly degrade the value of this software. i would look for an alternative accounting software package. i do not know anyone who has used this software that would give it a five star rating. in other words, i am very skeptical of the rating shown.
description is misleading. there is no way to enter or see expenses in this app and of course no way to attach receipt pictures to these expenses. you can enter expenses using computer and attach picture of receipt there, but not in this app. if you need a plug in to do that, why not to say so? or just remove missing components from description.
. can't use, there is no google login like on the website
can‚Äôt subscribe after trial period. it‚Äôs a good quickbooks version but i started trial period made a profile and invoices but the app won‚Äôt let me renew subscription the buy now button doesn‚Äôt work when clicked on. now i may have to start another profile and lose everything?
must have for any mobile business.. great app, syncs nicely. will give 5 stars once more functionality evolves. very user friendly.
ok but. reasonably happy with it but so many of my customers are also suppliers so i really would like an entity database where an entity could be both a customer and a supplier rather than having separate customer and supplier databases which necessitates the creation and therefore data entry for the same entity twice.
. love this app! very user friendly and great for my small business!!
"sam. i havent logged in since. when i just launch the app, it says ""device offline"" everytime. although i use alll other apps smoothjy, why this? i even tried deleting it and downloading again..."
. simple and worth
love this app!. i have my own business and quick books makes my life a lot easier.
online. online is really user friendly and the app is a bonus
business management made easy.... quickbooks has taken the pain and most of the time out of bookkeeping for my photography business. it lets me spend my time working with customers and get invoices out promptly to get paid!
great app. absolutely helpful and useful
great for small business owners.. awesome app. very convenient and keeps the finances and work orders organized. takes some trial and error but well worth the effort to learn this system. you tube has many instructional videos on how to expedite learning this program. price is reasonable for what you get. don't hesitate to get it. if anything you will learn something.
no refund and help support was clueless.. called twice no one could help me and both phone numbers proved useless. billing support was not helpful. could not even locate my ipad online subscription thru itunes. waste of time and money in my experience.
pos for the online version. very unhappy because after 5 years they still don‚Äôt have a pos system for the online version.
. premier retour d'exp√©rience positif apr√®s quelques jours d'utilisaton. 4 √©toiles car nous cherchons encore quelques outils et la mise en page du devis facture pourrait √™tre am√©lior√© notamment par le rappel de produits d√©j√† r√©dig√©s et les principaux outils gras italique taille de police
great small business tool. excellent on a laptop, dient handel banks with authentication dongles very well, mobile app doesn't handle them at all. can't do payroll from mobile. receipt tracking is easy and works well. reports and snap shots handy.
great. great for uploading expenses on the run.
almost impossible to cancel fees. on hold and multiple phone calls. they insist on you jumping through their hoops to cancel the auto pay. it's easier to get your credit card to stop the payments.
saves me 250month on payroll.. i can now run my corporation from my tablet, without an accountant. invoice on job site while on the clock instead of for free at home away from kids. also it‚Äôs 250 bucks a month cheaper for qb to do my payroll compared to my accountant to do quarterly sales tax reporting and weekly payroll for 1 5 employees...
crashes 3 seconds after loading.  every time it loads, it crashes 3 seconds after. unusable. even deleting and reinstalling doesn't fix the problem. come on intuit, get it fixed.
. very convenient app. can manage a lot on my phone when have time and when busy to get to the lap top. highly recommend for small business.
are you kidding me?. do i really have to download my company data every time i write an invoice or add an expense?! i have a feeling you are going to lose a lot of customers if you don't change it back to how it used to work. very dissatisfied with how long it takes to download company data.
. easy to create invoices in the field
. needs to be better i use desktop version for my small business. desktop version is great but i refuse to use mobile. freezes every time i click something, selecting store location is unavailable. its a shame such a good program is way behind on mobile capabilities. please make mobile like desktop
great app. i use this app every day.
qb online. tout ce qu'il faut pour la pme. facilit√©, mobilit√©, flexibilit√©! un support technique accessible, comp√©tent et rapide.
useful app. the app is very helpful for my business, i just which the stock category could be more detailed towards distribution more. but i do give the app the thumbs up üëçüèæüëçüèæ
best accounts app. seems to be the best one out there, easy to use on iphone
. don't fill up your information for free trial it's easy to set up for free trial. they doesn't have options in app for unsubscribe your free trial. you have to reach them every day for unsubscribe your free trial. if you not satisfied from app then start call them before 5days, they will not answer your call till your free trial not get expired. be careful before you sign up.
awful.. you can't even add transactions to your account registers. ridiculous.
. app crashes every time i try to go into banking section. have kept giving it a go over last 12 months as desktoponline versions are brilliant but mobile version still crashes
need customer signature. please provide customer signature for android like you guys did for ipad...
utter crap. if i could give no stars i would app crashes all the time won't send invoices to customers i have had for years have been struggling on with quickbooks for several years but now can't take the frustration anymore caused by this utter waste of money.
. desktop site works great, mobile site is trash and i can't even log into my account through app. says i don't have an account? okkkkk. tried reinstalling but no dice. i'll stick with the desktop site thanks
great app. quickbooks online allows me to work from home easily. i have only had some minor hiccups but nothing to give it a bad review. very pleased with the software.
. zero! the app says it needs to update, then brings me to a screen giving a choice of uninstall or open. if i choose open, i'm back to the need to update. if i uninstall and reinstall, that's just more steps before i'm back to the same useless place. garbage software.
. best app yet
disappointed. i‚Äôve been using the phone app for a year now. when the app works it is fine however it constantly freezes and my only option is to restart my phone. i have deleted and downloaded the app several times but it has not fixed the issues.
highly recommended!!. as a self employed tradesman, i was finding myself spending countless hours quoting & invoicing! this app has made running my business much smoother and given me free time on evenings (which is rare). admittedly it was pretty tricky to setup but the support helpline (both telephone & email) were fantastic at helping out. already recommended to other friends in the trade üëç
excellent app. keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
qb online is great!. i love this application. intuit really did a fantastic job with both the online web access and the apps to support the service. i fully recommend it to anyone who asks me what is the best accounting package on the internet.
very nice app. easy to use makes life lot easier and saves time
. problems with poor follow up i had problems with this app send support email and they don't follow up
worthless. some functions don't work at all like banking. doesn't load account activity. it's so useless i have to use mobile web version.
. i can't use this app at all because it will not sync to my bank. not the app or any of the services offered. i'm trying to cancel all of my subscriptions and services and it seems impossible to do. directions for canceling do not work. i have yet to see any cancellation choices in any drop down menus. i'm paying for services that i can not use and unable to cancel which is a scam.
i like it. i have enjoyed using this app for the last year. i am blind and it is 99% accessible with my screen reader, voiceover. i only want to report one error. the last update causes the app to crash when trying to edit an expense entry my accountant manages my quickbooks online account, however, when i find an incorrect category has been applied, i cannot fix it. the app crashes when i attempt
"useless. i use quickbooks online extensively at my corporate office. this app, and what is available through the ""mobile"" website version of qb online, is useless for getting any work done outside of the office."
best app. this made my life simpler!!!
useless for mobile access. doesn't have any of the features you would expect from a mobile app. if you want to do anything other than create a invoice or view transactions you put in from your desktop, its a waste of time. no balances, no accounts, nothing useful at all.
love it!!!. app is easy to use and saves me so time! wish i did it a long time ago!
. just to clarify, if you are based in the eu and therefore required to comply with gdpr, you need to know that your data is stored in the usa. the software if very good, but this is a huge security issue that they refuse to answer clearly
. i have just started my own small business and this programapp is great and easy too use
. this app is easy to use, once you get the hang of it. i can take pictures of all receipt which makes it easy to keep track.
no employee support. this app doesn't allow you to do anything unless your account is the owner of the books you are looking at. i was added to the subscription but upon logging into the app was told i had no subscriptions. also unable to use my browser as mobile support doesn't exist for the website and they take it a step further by detecting you are using a phone a blocking you from a non mobile version of the site. very disappointing.
deposits take too long. overall the app is convenient for clients to pay me, but it takes entirely too long for deposits to be posted to my account.
portable accounts. create and send invoices wherever i am.
love it!. this app is great. i can almost do everything i need to on it. great way to check accounts on the go.
very easy to use with my s5 from anywhere. very handy when you are out of the office and need to send invoices right away. love it
they do not fix bugs at all.. constant new annoying bugs that have been around for years now. i have written multiple times to help make them aware, now i have been writing complaints and still no fixes. am literally logging into the app every single time i open it. i have to use this app for my work. no choice. but if you have a choice then you should choose literally any other app. this company is terrible.
one man show. this app helps tons: estimate and invoice from anywhere.
not happy any longer!. having issues logging in every single time now, very frustrating and not happy at all. always asking for finger print, and when typing in my password, it takes about 5 attempts before it‚Äôll login to my company info. also having a constant lag when trying to inputsubmit any items to customers. this is extremely upsetting when trying to submit invoices before a deadline.
brilliant!. easy to use, matches payments received and ties them off with your invoices, easy to see profit and expenses for each month. well worth the monthly payment, my books have never been so easy to keep!
". made an payment 3 days ago and still getting an error ""subscription error"" ereceipt sent. update, it's been 5 days and i'm still locked out of my account after payment was made. quickbooks has offered to transfer payment method directly to them. google play informed me that quickbooks refuses to refund my subscription, while quickbooks denies that that is the case. fyi been a quickbooks user for 3 years now, and never had an issue, til now."
most productive app. using this app on my iphone and ipad hs made my life so much easier! i've been able to invoice my customers without having to lug me laptop around. truly an awesome app!
. was working awesome until last update. now won't log in. just has that loading thing come up forever
. like it so far. i'll give update late if anything changes
. worst app don't share your documents any where
. michael amazing app works flawlessl!!!!
it works great!. great app and works flawlessly.
can't log in. crashes every time i try to log in. reinstalled twice. no go.
. very easy to use mobile accounting app
. quickbooks makes my life so much easier for writing amd sending estimates and invoices. there are so many other things that quickbooks can do that im slowly learning. im writing so many estimates and getting so much work from easier estimate and invoice writing its really hard for me to get the time sit down amd learn everything else quickbooks has to offer.
works and convenient. easy way to enter sales and expenses. i've had no problems with this app.
works great but there are a few quirks. works really well but an offline option could really help the app work better. currently, the system could not generate the entries with no internet connection. it would be nice to be able to work offline first then reconnect when a sync is needed.
excellent app for small business. been using this app for 2 years and we have no complaints. most efficient app for operating a small business. a+
easy to use. easy access to all key features and very responsive app
broken app. unusable. app fails to load company data. waited an hour on the phone and never got help. killing my ability to invoice customers while mobile, which is the only reason i chose the online version that i pay for every month! intuit is not intuitive, they're only into your money. zero support. zero answers. zero. the worst.
so easy. this app is user friendly and intuitive. i like being able to see the reports and add attachments to expenses. highly recommended for small businesses owners.
. error code 132.100 quickbooks doesnt even have a fix for it. customer service has no clue as to what they are doing. i like paying for software that i can't use
app crashes in ios 13 & 13.1 .. app crashes in ios 13 & 13.1 . customer service had no clue
best addition for any business on the go!. the free trial was amazing. my favorite part is having the ability to send invoices. while setting up my merchant services, customer support was kind and easy to work with. now it's easier to bill my clients from my phone. i track everything. get the quickbooks app. you won't regret it!
. dashboard does not load. completely useless at this point. cannot invoice, add expenses or write sales receipts.
always improving. qbo isn't perfect but it is always improving. this week's update included features for accountants to track their client's pending work, communicate questions and request documents. this is good stuff!
it's great. enjoy this app
. the app sucks really bad, it's full of continuous bugs and it is unstable, every time you try to add attachments to expenses the app freezes does not save and shut down, find another solution because it's sad.
great for business. it's great that you can send invoices from phone. it would be even greater if it had a deposit feature. that way when you're at the bank you can just look on the app and see and check off your deposits from undeposited funds.
. takes a lot of youtube to learn how to use the app but i love it!
"enjoying quickbooks online. easy to use interface and they are frequently updating features. my only complaint is that sometimes when searching for sent invoices it won't recognize, for example 74, when it's ""invoice 2015074"""
a very useful application. i find it quite convenient to be able to enter expenses from my phone and include photographs receipts when i am on the go. i use quickbooks online and although the app is limited in some respects as far as functionality goes the limits that other reviewers have discussed has not affected my business at all. i like it a lot :)
. best account software i've used
broken app. unusable. going on over a week like this. killing my ability to invoice customers while mobile, which is the only reason i chose the online version that i pay for every month! intuit is not intuitive, they're only into your money.
unclear and sneaky. nowhere in the app did it say that i needed a different product if i‚Äôm selfemployed. so i signed up and paid for my first month without knowing that it wasn‚Äôt the right one. i‚Äôve paid double the amount i needed to and not even used it and never will use it. a waste of money. not happy at all.
. been able to keep on top of my record keeping so much easier
. so far, so good... much better and more functional than similar apps.
great app a must for business. i have waited to switch to qb online as i had read a lot of negative feedback but this is a great app for keeping in touch with the finances of you business and easy for those not trained as an accountant
we are in love with qbo. hated accounting thru qb before but this year's online version plus the android app made us change our mind ... now we absolutely love it and we can't thank the intuit team enough for creating such friendly qb online version for business. much appreciated, lanareale.com
. app banking does not work on android pixel 3. crashes as its loading transactions. i called quickbooks and got the runaround, didnt take my issue seriously. stuck using computer
great but i need.... to be able to apply discountsclient credits when creating an invoice on the app. add that and it will be perfect. for some reason the code doesn't allow for negative numbers when creating invoices in app, but on the computer it works just fine. thanks!
. this online version sucks .... been using qbooks since verizon 1 in dos this one has screwed more stuff up that is when it actually loads ... i don't recommend the online at all
good app. i like simple, this is efficient for my small busines, updates are making the app better. i can recomend it is supper easy to use.
happy and safe. at last. an easy to use app that work well for fast quoting and invoicing while on the go. my b2b clients are very impressed on how fast my quotesinvoices come in. it's a great selling point to my business.
so useful.... i don't really use it like it's designed. i have 50 company trucks & 5 semi trucks to keep track of at our repair shop. this allows me to document everything. each vehicle as a customer with year & type always easy to find. each invoice acts as a repair, allows me to document every detail and track costs. luv this app! well worth the subscription fee.
don't like new update. i prefer buttons actions on the bottom than puede corner and still missing two things, send invoices by text, fax, edit or view notes online
awesome app. love it
. excellent app to get into your data on the road. i understand more functionality would be useful but being able to raise & query jobs and send out estimates & invoices 'in the wild' on my mobile phone is a real asset.
waste of time and slow. i didn‚Äôt even get past the registration. the app was soo slow and laggy when i was trying to put my details in i gave up. couldn‚Äôt imagine the amount of time i‚Äôd waste trying to write up quotes or invoices on it. avoid!!!
receipt should be easier. i need to take the pictures first and upload them to qb it used to take the picture in the qb.
nice app!. i live on my device  from research to book keeping. elegant style and useful! i can do almost everything from my note 2! light years beyond the old quick books that i used 10 years ago! i'm sending invoices in minutes. awesome! update: still a great app on my nexus 6!
app doesn't work. since updating this a couple of days ago, can't open the app at all. please sort!
. app data is never accurate. i hate to login via mobile web to get accurate numbers. misleading and frustrating
phone number. i like the app. i can use it for my business plan. but when im entering my phone number to create my account, it says invalid. please fix. country: philippines
nice app. nice app, quick and easy. smart invoices and bank matches. i don't like paypal, so wouldn't use that payment option.
pretty basic and useless. edit: still can‚Äôt see monthly reports. i don‚Äôt need the annual pl as much as the monthly. can't do a lot of things. it's very very basic , pretty much a basic overview of your account. you can‚Äôt do anything even as detailed as seeing the transactions in a pl report. it‚Äôs only broad overview stuff and entering new transactions. can‚Äôt even switch cash vs accrual. severely limited and cannot work in a pinch when you can‚Äôt use an actual computer.
very misleading. you can download the app for free and use it for free... for the thirty days üò° then you have to pay 11.49 a month? ü§¨ that
the best. i used qb desktop from 2004 until fall 2016 when i switched to qb online. had heard bad things about the online making me nervous about the switch but i guess they‚Äôve gotten the bugs worked out. absolutely love qb online. love that our dispatching software works with it.
almost usless. the app does not show all the info like logging in from a pc. also scrolling up or down on a page is very glitchy. quickbooks has a lot of work to do on making this app useful.
bad customer services to cancel. struggling to get the right information on how to cancel before getting charged as i'm using other software now. been contacted twice with the wrong info.
it gets even easier. i was horrified when i heard tax going digital but quickly got the hang of quick books and amazed it even tries to match things . brilliant
. awesome app use it everyday on the go.
fabulous!. i really like using qb, i'm a small business owner and once i got the idea of things i find qb relatively easy to use. when integration starts with square it will be 5 stars for me üòä
really useful. great app allowing me to raise invoices whilst on site, confirm details with clients and syncs with the software back at the office.
very handy  will stop the boss bugging me!. good app for the boss to have. super easy to check on customers invoices overdue etc. would like to see timesheet daily activity integration please  perhaps with a contollable daily multiple nag me to enter times feature? with timesheet integration i could roll this out to other staff :) cheers!
. app crashs more then i can use it nearly impossible to get my work done will definitely be looking in to other ways t invoice and accept payments
. great even w limited functions i love this ap which allows us to do estimates out in the field and create new customers. we had lost a lot of valueable information because we didn't have a convenient system for integrating that info into our accounting system. i would love to see more functions added to the ap but right now it has improved our workflow and info management.
. app start hi nahi ho raha he,add company karte hi restart ho jata he
accept transactions fixed. latest update fixed accepting transactions.
entering bills?????. why have intuit decided not to support bill entering on this app?!? it great i can import my paper receipts using the camera, but whats the point if i can't enter as a bill only an expense?!?
love it. very simple you use and looks professional, only think i‚Äôd say is don‚Äôt let your trail run completely out before you buy because it won‚Äôt instantly be back up and running takes a few days
. just unistalled and reinstalled the app hopefully it is going to work. after doing over 70 invoices it stopped working dashboard showed blank üòï
great as an assistant to the desktop version.. i've found this app to be a great mobile partner to the full desktop (or online) version. there's a couple functions that aren't available in the app but everything you do need is easily available. i can't connect my bank account because my (non us) bank isn't listed but being able to input expenses as they happen is a great way of keeping updated accounts. reconciliation is a breeze afterwards. it's a great app.
no other compares. no other accounting software appprogram compares or gives you the power and knowledge at your finger tips. great app. easy to use. tons of features. perfect or managing your business on the go!!
. it is a cool app
mileage tracker. any chance you can put a mileage tracker on this app? other wise it's perfect for small business
pretty good could be great. this ties in nicely with the desktop version. it's not 5* purely because of the actual software not the app itself. the customising of the invoice isn't great and adding previous invoices when you first start isn't great but if you're not worried about that it works well!
. does basic accounting. cool. i paid money for this. clunky interface. settings buried in random locations. the desktop, browserbased, application is equally, if not more, terrible. this is a professional product?
. why can't i see bank account details in the app? you can on the ios app contacted help desk who couldn't help! without access to accounts the app is effectively useless. i have done everything you suggest. home screen is now blank! so even worse than when i started. i have also contacted support with no solution as yet.
loved it. its very useful app to track expenses and invoice.
. experience several issues with the mobile app.
experience getting worse. entering transaction requires way too many taps. it isn‚Äôt location aware to suggest transactions you just always search. recent updates have some bug that makes the app download the data file with almost every login and login often you must. usually twice a week it loses my password. i have enjoyed quickbooks online but this app experience may have me evaluating competitors in december.
. great app for running my business
great ap. i love using this quick books online. very easy to use and it a lows me to use my ipad phone or desktop to access your account.
. i like the simplicity of the app.
great and easy to use. anyone can figure it out! nice, fast, and easy. qbo has been a big upgrade for our company
tr√®s bon logiciel de gestion. tr√®s impressionnant, facile d'utilisation.
great app!. i'm in love with this app, too bad that the proadvisor app doesn't work as sharp (doesn't work at all).
. how do i unsubscribe
. intuit sucks! scamming company ran by non english speaking reps. bought simple start 2007 for 125.00 with online access ,etc. in 2010 they ended all support for this software. that is shady. they promise you all these free services and then years later a foreigner informs you that all support has ended. to better serve there newer products. they suck.
. great app. life gets easier.
worst customer support of all time. some of their custom support reps are amazing. some don‚Äôt even know their own policies. i‚Äôve had several different issues with them with several different companies and aspects of their platform and i‚Äôll never use them again and recommend anyone to check other accounting softwares out before going to quick books as future risk and frustration mitigation.
. best app ever.
easy. i have found this app very easy to use. being able to tap into your invoicing system when out on a job. it enables me to issue an invoice same moment the job is finished and emailed to my customer stood in front of me, that way my customer has a paperless invoice and can pay you right away. saves time!
. absolutely phenomenal app. it has been helping me run my small business for the last 3 to 4 years
update ruined a great small business tool. quickbooks use to be an awesome tool to let us send invoices after a job is completed on the spot. it also allowed a user to edit payment information anywhere via the mobile app. this is now all gone thanks to the new update. if it is not fixed soon, we are looking into transferring our accounts to another system.
useless!. can't edit products without losing the changes. can't edit purchases. overall, still very buggy and slow. had to buy a windows 10 tablet to get it to work. mobile apps for ios and android sucks big time!
. it keeps things simple for us.
owner. this software has been the best ever. it has made my job so much easier and faster for billing.
love it. huge time saver to photo and input expenses. i can't imagine my life without it.
great for my employers. i'm an office manager at two companies, and i've been able to save my employers, field technicians, and office staff time, money, and paper with qbo. thanks intuit!
jason arnold. so far quickbooks has been great. their program has some flaws i‚Äôm told they are working on. the payroll is very very slow to get up and running. but all i. all it saves me time and money
. this app is useless and doesn't work properly on a phone
nice app but not fixing known issues. this is a really good app and i would give it five stars except i keep getting an error message when opening up certain accounts from the chart of accounts. this has been going on for months and quickbooks knows about it and doesn't fix it.
. okay but needs expenses option like on iphone. i justed switched from iphone and ios and am really bummed out you can't enter expenses: checks paid, credit card, or cash transactions. this is available on ios already why is this still not ready for android?
quickbooks. really hard to get online started i'll write another review when i get it started
major flaw  can't run payroll or attached from dropbox. 3 stars as you are unable to run payrol on the go or even view payroll  employees wages which is a major part of this app that is missing. also when uploading attachments you can attached anything other than a photo. no links to dropbox etc which again is a major flaw
great app. this is getting better with each update it makes. i you this app everyday to run my practice and it makes it very convenient because i'm constantly on the road and i don't have to sit at my desk just to enter expenses or send invoices to clients.
best accounting app i've used. this makes my business run smooth and conveniently, i hope they bring more functionality to it still.
. useful!
. don't fill up your information for free trial it's easy to set up for free trial. they doesn't have options in app for unsubscribe your free trial. you have to reach them every day for unsubscribe your free trial. if you not satisfied from app then start call them before 5days, they will not answer your call till your free trial not get expired. be careful before you sign up.
. it makes creating estimates simpler. i used to fumble my way thru, now it's simple and fun!
awful software. i have quickbooks for years and the service is awful and the customer service reps can't help you. plus read the small print about the merchant account i have been paying 4% on credit card transactions. simply horrible
great system. quickbooks online has made my life loads easier and less stressful many thanks
. works great and simple to use
. very cool for our business great app helps put us a step ahead of the competition and print an estimate on the spot from our truck selling the job automatically.
. great app !!
presently surprised. i really did not want to move away from the desktop version i purchased, back when that was a thing. however, i am really enjoying being able to create invoices, collect payments, etc. while on the go. so i suppose i will get used to this payasyougo thing ;)
business app. convenient way to manage business accounting on the go.
won't save receipts. try to record receipts in expenses, just get error message. called the number the message had, person they don't offer support for mobile devices or their app.**** update i did as you requested the day you requested and to date have not heard back from your staff. same issue with samsung 10.1 tablet and s6 phone.
. best app for small businesses
best app ever. love quickbooks online.... easiest way to keep all my accounts and expenses in order.
. nothing but problems  continuous billing issues for 3 months so i cancelled. far from having a month free and paying ¬£6mth for the past 2 months, i have paid over ¬£45. really frustrated with quickbooks. i will be looking for an alternative.
jackrabbit. enjoy using this app. would like to see more options on bank balances
works but needs work. for the most part the product works, but has many errors and sometimes says there are errors but they are never fixed, i run the lasted ios on an iphone 6 and still have many problems
. seriously guys, this app is constantly updated, but still moves at a glacial pace and consistently crashes. get your business in order so we can keep ours in order!
. great but like any software you have to take time to learn its capabilities and bugs
a pretty good app. update: they added deposits! it does everything i need now, upgrading to 5 star! all in all, this is a pretty great app. it does just about everything i need it to while on the go, but it is missing one key piece of functionality. it does not allow the recording of deposits and that is really important for me. other than that it functions flawlessly and has never given me any trouble. overall, i love it!
qbo is essential. i have my own consulting company and qbo makes running my business much more efficient. even an accountant client agrees. one of the best features is the expense recording. at a business lunch, i'll take a pic of the receipt, record the transaction and that's it. don't have to think about it again. i couldn't function without qbo!
thnx the app. i loved it
still slow & buggy. home page shows update date as current and. transactions to reconcile yet when i go to the individual accounts to do it the numbers are either wrong or transactions not there...
works great!!. using quickbooks since the past 6 months now. great software, thanks. :)
impressed. i put off upgrading to online version after using quickbooks pro for five years, struggling to enter online direct debit expenses and payments. online version makes entering data easy and efficient. such a time saver for me. well done intuit! definitely worth the monthly subscription fee.
great app. i don't understand what some people are complaining about it. this app works great. thank you
quickbooks online. an easy to use system to keep track of your business accounts whilst on the move or on the couch at the end a hard day. works we'll on pc or ipad. very happy so far. looking forward to future upgrades etc.
great software & online support. quickbooks support is great
. very useful for my business
problem in showing reports. first of all i would like to say that it is a very good accounts managment software online but there are some problems which is faced by me as compare to the tally software like showing reports and many more and i have complained for that to customer care representative thanks regards muhmmad faisal hussain outflank trading pvt. ltd. 9999926273
. i thought it was bad three years ago! its much worse now. not user friendly and still doesnt support my form of business. all they really do with this app is track your bank account and catigorise things. you can only catigorise as an expense or income. its the new year and new month and its counting transaction from jan 2019 as transactions from december 2018. i need help. any recomendations on business softwesr that also has tax softwear?
. i love this app! makea my life easier:)
mobile app. not happy. i am on the phone with support everyday. won't print on app or on chrome. they don't know what to do. this mobile is worthless to me. i don't have time for this!
so helpful. my business is basically my husband and me. when we are both out of the office, it's been difficult to have to wait to help customers. this app has allowed me to to create an invoice from an estimate, accept payment and send a receipt all from the truck!
portable. great app for running a business on the road. i wish it had progressive invoicing....but overall i am happy.
crap. this update is crap. my invoices won't update with the ipad. nothing like beta testing on your customers. typical for quickbooks
better if had a progress invoice option.. almost complete, but not perfect. still missing progress invoices feature. i‚Äôm using 2 apps because i need that.
. very handy.
cannot log into app. cannot log in.
. geat app!
i would not recommend. 1. very very very expensive 2. not intuitive and not user friendly 3. no local support or live support from malaysia
. unable to see inventory creation in mobile app gear symbol is not there in downliaded app
. great app. i have had excellent customer service experiences.
. not for me and now i can't unsubscribe or delete account please delete account i don't want it and your unsubscribe tool does not work.
. this apo no longer works. i cannot make invoices, sales receipts, etc. i called quickbooks and they said there is nothing they could do. i have a mobile business and relied on this app, now it's useless.
. simple to use
very user friendly. great app for on the go people
phone app fail. what ever opinion you have of qbo ... the phone app fails. it will not let you see the estimates and invoices for a customer. they exist, in your system but they do not show up in the app. everything else.... any other feature discussion... it's all irrelevant. if you can't view basic customer info, the app fails.
superb accounting app. the only mobile app i recommend if you are into real estate. it makes my job as a small real estate owner easier and smarter. thanks quickbooks for this amazing app. great job on maintaining it. cheers! üëçü•Ç
new update 115. the new update is horrible!! i used to be able to search customers by address and the search bar is gone. also, whatever screen i choose to be in, i have to fully close the app out to go back! what happened?!?!
. this app is extremely slow, to the point of being unusable. the bank feed is ridiculously slow, anf accepting transactions lags terribly.
perfect for running small businesses, but...... everything you need to run a small business...but $35 is way to expensive, shouldn't cost more than $25! i‚Äôm very happy with the software and with a few dedicated hours i learned how to use it inside and out.
. login with google sign on sends me out to my browser then asks for password creation. continuous loop back to app then back to browser. have not been able to log in once. followed directions online for help still unable to sign in. no other app does this. guess im stuck using my desktop for quickbooks. may have to look into an alternative.
please fix!!. i have used this app for the last few years for my business and have loved it. this latest update has made the app virtually unusable. it won't let me save an invoice, doesn't show payments made, makes me sign in every time even though i have a pin and the list goes on. very disappointed and hoping this is fixed soon.
. i absolutely love this app. so very user friendly and convenient when doing business on the go even from my phone.
. dreadful experience so far. bought qb 16th dec 2019 and cant get a call back from an english speaker to help me with set up despite multiple attempts! why is sales uk based but support isnt? this is 2nd review  1st disappeared!!! so disappointed and very desperate to get started. i can login to qb online but says im in usa not uk please tell me who to email in response qb
payslips via app. can‚Äôt access the payslip‚Äôs by using app ??
another year and totally happy!. everything i need to invoice and stay on top of calls is on my phone. update a year later still going strong. no issues or problems so far.
good app so far. good stuff
. i could not conduct business without qb. perfect fit for a busy company with daily billing. simple ui that allows you to quickly send invoices, follow up on past due, monitor sales and generate reports. we are very pleased with qb.
. i have talked to intuit support multiple times of why i can't enter charges so i can document on the go. my phone has a bigger screen resolution than my ipad. since the jellybean browser and firefox registers as an ancient copy of chrome, i'm stuck with remote desktoping to a real computer to do work. thanks intuit.
. a lot to learn but works well.
. very helpful people to assist. easy to use in general. a little difficult to get head around undeposited funds and matching balances. yet great looking invoices and easy to track when payments are due.
very helpful.... there are some glitches with a couple of the features but for the most part, it‚Äôs exactly what i need. a great help for record keeping and invoicing my customers efficiently. there should be an option to select and send multiple invoices at once. i have multiple invoices per customer each week.
. does not work on nexus 6 developer preview
. its a very helpful app for businesses
. full time hang and not working properly
. simple to use and good value. love the app!
. my subscription was canceled and i have not been able to restore it.
not that great for me. can't write po's...good for regular expenses banking etc...
too many problems entering expenses. he expenses are not taking the payee. i had to switch to desktop to enter the expenses with the payee. hopefully quickbooks will address it.
a good assistant on the go. the phone app doesn't do as much as i'd like but i couldn't run my business without the software!
cloud attachments  well done!. i've been waiting years for the ability to attach files to an invoice from a cloudbased source and it's finally here in this release. thank you! now my computer usage is 99% ios, independent of a desktop.
what is the point?. of supporting touch id on my mobile device if every time i go to use it first thing in the morning i have use my password then my touch id works for the rest of the day but back to square in the next. useless feature.
c'mon man. still won't let you attach items. ...... please fix!
excellent!!. i find the app useful when i need it most. i enjoy the ability to add an expense at any time. sales receipts are handy. basically everything i really need without requiring a ton of space on my phone.
latest update rocks. now you get your bank feeds in the app, so you can easily process your incoming payments and expenses. the only thing missing is the ability to attach a file during that process. hope it's something that will be included in a future update.
pro advisor. the training videos and exam are not opening on my ipad. apparently doesn‚Äôt work with safari. i have tried everything possible in my settings.
great app!. this app great. helps me stay organized
. fab app and program. saves time and money. should have done it years ago.
. great app to use along side quickbooks online. i like being able to send estimates and invoices on my mobile device with the quickbooks app!
"update broke the app. since the update i have to type my password each time i open it after it has been closed for a while. this doesn't work in front of customers. (yes, i enabled touchid. the problem seem to be hitting others and is based on now intuit decided to ""fix"" touchid by breaking it in this version)"
quicbooks is just plain lame. absolutely ridiculous how one cannot add extra fields in invoicing. support is full of excuses claiming things will be fixed and never goes anywhere. then got message that everything from qbse would have to be migrated to their more comprehensive (read expensive) package... basically just a trap.
. i truly love quickbooks although... they could improve on the mobile app as i find that it lags sometimes and takes awhile to open when you click on the app.
. very user friendly app to use
bad service. very bad service customer support team is bad zero star........
love quickbooks. quickbooks is a simple platform that allows a small business owner with excellent record keeping.
slow.. not was easy as before. not much function as before. some new function was not useful
. after new update app stuck on dashboard. unable to perform work on app. please fix this issue
. great app
. quick like the name suggests. very easy and straightforward app. makes completing my invoices and submitting easy
pretty basic and useless. edit: still can‚Äôt see monthly reports. i don‚Äôt need the annual pl as much as the monthly. can't do a lot of things. it's very very basic , pretty much a basic overview of your account. you can‚Äôt do anything even as detailed as seeing the transactions in a pl report. it‚Äôs only broad overview stuff and entering new transactions. can‚Äôt even switch cash vs accrual. severely limited and cannot work in a pinch when you can‚Äôt use an actual computer.
love the app. i have enjoyed using this service.
brilliant. brilliant app keeps my business in order
not very user friendly.. not very user friendly. have to open the app twice every time i use it. it says critical updates required log out and log in to refresh. every. single. time. i . open. the. app. i‚Äôve tried deleting and reinstalling multiple times. when entering receipts it could have a search box at the top of vendor list do you don‚Äôt have to ask to search every time.
quicbooks is just plain lame. absolutely ridiculous how one cannot add extra fields in invoicing. support is full of excuses claiming things will be fixed and never goes anywhere. then got message that everything from qbse would have to be migrated to their more comprehensive (read expensive) package... basically just a trap.
limited usefulness. app is fairly thin on functional features. if you aren't doing invoices might as well go to the real website instead.
"crash. all looks great until i press ""start your free trial""... crash and close. please fix this and i will change my review. not a great start..."
small business? yes you need this. what a way to manage your small business specially if you're in the run send quote invoices and more
. porque tem coisas escritas em ingl√™s?
appr√©ciation. vraiment bien pens√©e, facile d'utilisation et efficace ! thoughtful application, easy to use and useful !
. great app makes my life much easier.
this works for me.... i have a hard time keeping up with my invoices but this makes it simple for me to keep track on the move or like right now laying in my bed creating invoices and estimates. this is great.
quickbooks makes it easy. quickbooks is one of the biggest reasons my company has hit tremendous growth. online invoices and payments makes my job literally a thousand times easier.
when i am done, i am done!. as a contractor i love to do my estimates one time, hit convert to invoice one time, hit receive payment one time and i am done with my paperwork and money is heading my way before i leave the job site. when i get home i can just spend time with the family rather than swim through paperwork. great service!
chrashing in estimates. the app is great, only hiccup is that it restarts as soon as i go into opening a new estimate
using new app for a week more problems longer i use it. really unhappy  i am missing data and receiving error messages and my only option for assistance is to use a form. am completely disappointed in quickbooks. limited functionality! come on intuit can't do any better than this and keep up with the times i have to use a computer or laptop to get full functionality?!
quickbooks. very good app i will purchase after my trial thanks
. i love the app! there are a few updates i'd like to see on the estimates and order entry fields but it's still saves so much time. it really has changed the way i do business. great app and program.
magnifico. aplicativo e software excelente! vale muito o investimento!
. great app, simple to use ... a business can't move past a certain point without a reliable payment and invoice tracking system .... quick books delivers and is constantly improving ... highly recommended!!
. quickbooks makes my life so much easier for writing amd sending estimates and invoices. there are so many other things that quickbooks can do that im slowly learning. im writing so many estimates and getting so much work from easier estimate and invoice writing its really hard for me to get the time sit down amd learn everything else quickbooks has to offer.
garbage. this app is junk!! support for this app is useless looks like i will be going back to freshbooks, it may not be a accounting solution but at least it works and i can import my info without manually entering. my business doesn't have time for me to spend hours with support when i need to be taking care of my customers ms support
. stupid 2apps at qb idot coders. so you have one app and it is great that tracks mileage and receipts but it doesn't communicate with cloud quickbooks. then you have this app that doesn't have those features. how can you dominate the market and be this foolish someone's going to come along and take their lunch money.
. great app
keep crashing. after last update keep crashing i can't create and send my invoice please fix asap
. log in issues and it stopped tracking my mileage on its on. i'm trying to pull my information for my taxes and it will not let me log on. more than frustrating, i want my money back!!!! and yes i have tried reinstalling the app!
love this app!!!!!. thank you this app is amazing!
does what i need. app is easy to navigate and has all functionality i am looking for.
frank. this app is amazing. it is exactly what i needed to start my business. it makes it quick and easy to do your estimates, invoices, and keep track of all your accounting needs.
. i operate two companies through the app and notice that suppliers and customers from one company end up being listed in the other! i would give more stars, but this is a glaring issue that needs resolving urgently.
small business owner. it's fantastic and professional for service contracting for management, but the fact that the crew in the field still use paper carbons to submit & clients want paper makes this a major problem. if the client doesn't give an email, or the field crew doesn't get the right info, i end up spending extra hours trying to figure it out...
great app. this program work great on my galaxy tab.
better than the rest. i keep trying to switch but end up back again because everything else sucks
awesome app. this app really helps me keep track of all my transactions for my pool business. easy to use and has everything i need.
good but frustrating.. no access to vendor information or purchase orders on an iphone or ipad. have complained about this for nearly 2 years. falling on deaf ears. they agree that it would make sense but there is no one that gives a *%!¬£ to do anything.
can't open.. i loved this app. i could work up estimates on the spot. add my receipts. it was really functional. i just got a note 5 and it won't even open the app. if not fixed soon. i will cancel my membership.
". mobile app is full of bugs, recent ""update"" has now made it so my account is unable to sync and wont let me log in. not very useful for my mobile business. tried reinstalling the app, still no luck. *tried clearing data, same issue."
. so simple to use! i normally use qb from my computer but the app works just as well while onthego.
mobility at its best!. is like having your business at the palm of your hands! just sent out a $40k invoice while on a cruise ship in mexico. also love the storeforward function. no need to be connected, once you get connected it will be sent out. great app!
. very good experience, very helpful and pro
not useful. hard to use. logs out when you switch screens. fields not consistent.
limited functionalty. the app has limited functionality, can't see transaction details of any expenses and income accounts; can only see the assets and was told to use the browser version. can't drill down from a report to see the details of the transactions. touch id login is handy. so it's better to just use the browser version.
. ease of use. it's very helpful to invoice and receive payments using my phone while still with a client
. rubbish, cannot connect to hrmc, hard to then cancel payment
unwanted changes. we pay for the service, yet intuit dictates changes to our invoices that have doubled our paper use as well as anger our customers. you make the changes without any notice or options to do otherwise. nasty, mean dictatorial behavior!
. not sure why i pay $16 a month for this app when it only works 60% of the time. please get the bugs worked out or i will have find another company to run my business with. cant access my account on tablet, cant save invoice or estimate on s8. please fix.
. best app for keeping up with your expenses
needs to be full featured. i love the program but hate that i can‚Äôt do into my vendor bills on the app for ipad. i can‚Äôt enter them in or view them on ipad. i can on browser view but even it needs to update as everything gets cit off in chrome and when you click the menu button to hide it it does not slide everything over so you can see more.
. super app
. won't let me unsubscribe to the app so stuck paying a monthly subscription for a service i don't use. there's better completely free apps out there.
. i like the software however it is still a bit confusing. i will need to spend more time training
. i gave it 3 stars because it's ok. it serves its purpose. i'm now disturbed because my monthly fee was $9.99. the month of september  i was billed $19.99. why?? if this is the case...i'm deleting this app. now i feel as if you're stealing from me!
no purchase orders. for years now quickbooks has withheld the ability to create purchase orders through the mobile app. this is a huge issue for our company and it is quite frustrating that qb has willfully omitted this feature. i wish there was a way to convince qb to change course on this decision...
it works most of the time. it‚Äôs useful to have the app but more often i go to the browser site as you can do more on it. the app is good if you just want to record a quick expense and take a photo of the receipt to attach. quickbooks itself is a good accounting package, it‚Äôs just the app needs a bit more functionality.
. awesome app
quickbooks. great program for the phone and computer and syncing together and great for small businesses that are on the go.
excellent app for small business owners!. has helped my business tremendously and makes us more efficient even on the go! love it!
. the cloud accounting system that actually is intuitive and has good app!
easy to use. i love my quickbooks app. this is the first year my taxes will be done on time because i didn't have to spend hours at desk!
retired. this new online version is the best so far. user friendly, everything you want to know is right in front of you when you sign in. easy to navigate
. useful and handy
my review. when i put in my login details it says 'error' and that's just about it. it won't let me on
fabulous. such a pleasure to use for both myself & my clients. thanks qbo.
ipad integration has gotten much worse. there seems to be no way to run a detailed report. the help section is worseless. i‚Äôve used qb for 20 years and it seems less trouble to learn another app than to continue. why remove functionality that used to be there?
. it's a great app
great and makes things easier. the best thing about quick books is that they have unlimited live customer service to help guide and assist you. that's a real plus to me.
. if you're used to the desktop version the transition to online is seemless and eases the file share process with yout accountant. i highly recommend for a small business
very slow. this app is very very slow.. 10 minutes to load , another 10 minutes to load customer screen, and 15 minutes to apply 1 payment
a poor mobile companion to qbo. there are so many things wrong with this app. for example, expenses have a note field that doesn't show notes entered in qbo (web). the length of the expense category field is so short that i can't distinguish among categories, especially nested ones. the app generally lacks the functionality it would need to make it a truly useful companion to qbo.
great but.... very great app. i rated three stars because you can‚Äôt enter employee time from your mobile device. i know it‚Äôs a mobile app but you should be able to enter time . i understand that mobile apps are a little different but this seems like a simple task that should be possible. i send invoices and estimates all the time with the mobile app other than that it‚Äôs a great app. will update rating when these features are added
great app. what a great app and ease of access across all platforms.
pretty good but, but no bill entry????. i have found this to be somewhat helpful for reviewing expenses, but it would be fantastic if i was able to pay bills on the go. i would love to be able to keep my business mobile by using the camera to ‚Äúscan‚Äù invoices and submit them for payment right from the app. a core function that is surprisingly absent. this is a must for future development. without it, the app just come up short...
it's my business anywhere. i can invoice on the go, check my accounts and keep doing business in my travels. love it.
easy to use, innovative and mobile friendly. we have been using qb at australiance.com for almost a year and i would not go back to my previous accounting software. the interface with paypal works well and save heaps of time for our online sales. it s easy to create expenses (e.g. business lunches etc), quotes or invoices on the go with the app + always know your bank account position as it interfaces directly with it.
. the app is really handy when adding expenses. easy to navigate.
love the convenience. great app
full functionality missing from mobile app.. quickbooks online and the mobile app do not communicate effectively. it's like running two different programs that aren't fully integrated. mobile app lacks time reports and seamless expense invoicing especially in expense details. attempting to add item descriptions to expense reports does not work. there simply isn't a place for it. also, attempting to view a transaction with time, mileage, or reimbursable expenses results in an unable to view prompt. as such the app gets one star.
downloading company data 247. when the app works it‚Äôs good and the recent updates have proved helpful. however 9 times out of 10 i am unable to use this app. it is constantly in a state of downloading my company data and while i do this all i can do is wait. very frustrating. as a result i have access qb through chrome on my phone and that has a number of rendering issues.
"intuit  ""design for delight"" _experience. awesome ! cheers . team foodtropis‚Ñ¢ (disrupting food consumption , globally )"
great software. very happy i use to use a different software but it wasn't as good as quickbooks thank you quickbooks
very convenient. app is great when you are not in your office.
excellent software. best products, excellent customer service, can't imagine how i would manage without it. thanks quickbooks!!!
terrible app. keeps crashing. keeps dumping you out telling you that ‚Äúcritical updates ‚Äú and must login again. try to login and  am a very longtime customer  it tells you your company is nonexistent. ba humbug. complain to intuit and they say use a ‚Äúsupported‚Äù device. in other words: don‚Äôt use the app. time to find software other than quick books.
at your fingertips. it's nice to be able to send invoices and check your books anywhere you are. haven't had any issues.
. love this app. can upload receipts wherever i am
the best invoice app. very simple to use and helps a lot! i recomend
love this app. works great and i can navigate and make invoices and track everything in one app! i love it
. extremely easy to use. great app to create and send invoices and accept payments, track business and personal spending... and it's all in one place. plus lots more.
expected better.. for quickbooks having been the leader for so long in small business accounting software, i expected more from their online format and their app. while it is great for quick, on the go stuff, you can't add accounts in the app. you have to log into the web version for that. overall, i expected more and felt i stepped backwards in using online from the desktop platform i had used for years.
needs to fix bugs. i love quickbooks online and the desktop version but their mobile app needs to fix their bugs. i told quickbooks support two months ago that i couldn't email an invoice from the app and they couldn't help me fix the problem then. i still cannot send invoices from my mobile app so it is basically useless to me.
not working properly after update. i just updated the app and now every time i try to edit an invoice it forces me to refresh the invoice and i lose my changes. the pin number does't work, i added it again and made sure it is turned on, but i have to sign in with my username and password each time. it worked perfectly on the last update.
quickbooks online. easy, simple to use.
. poor font style selection, own style updation can't doing from qb support team, complaint registered more than one month. can you please refund amount?
expensebill data missing in app. expense and bill data is not available in the iphone app while accessible online. what is the meaning of the app when i can't see any of my vendor bills or company expenses. development team???
. do not use unless you want to be on hold for over an hr and transferred multiple times. if you are a business owner and value your time go elsewhere
not working properly after update #2. people have businesses to run!! i understand glitches from freecheap apps. not something that costs $360year. my books don't match from my phone to my computer. the pin still doesn't work, every time i edited an invoice it magically created a copy of an invoice that showed up 2 days later. now i have a ton of clean up to do in my books. it's time for me to find new accounting software.
. nice app
. makes it so much easier to get things done, while i'm on the go go go. it's a great help to my business.
business owner. could use more features and customization on forms and invoices. some basic functions are missing. otherwise helpful. would recommend for a small business.
brilliant app. quickbooks is an amazing app. i'm an electrician with a small business, so i need something quick and easy when i'm in the field. entering expenses and creating invoices is so easy on my tablet andor phone saving me hours per week. great work...i'm very impressed!
great business tool. this program has helped me i the field like no other program i can think of.
. all the hype and there's no where or way to cancel a subscription.
loved the app until banking disappeared. i mainly use my computer to do most of our accounting but loved having the app so i could accept banking transactions during short periods of downtime thereby keeping our bank balance up to date all the time. then today i went to catch up on accepting transactions and banking has totally disappeared from the menu. help! what happened? i deleted and reinstalled the app to no avail.
. very slow. app doesnt update automatically. i have to manually update which takes forever for a relatively small number of changes to be downloaded. quite disappointed with it.
love it!. i love quickbooks online and i love this app!
very easy to use. makes dealing with finances very straightforward even on the road. great interface and reports. recommended!
i'm trying the app now i have a question. can i acess from a pc too? or is it only for the phone?
need a guide. new user here and i need this apps for my business... but i wanna know how to entry my daily sales..
. pretty simple
easy to use. easy to use and uploading image of receipts is very useful.
. very graet app
. great app
excellent once setup. i run my whole business on quickbooks. it was a little tricky to set up initially but once my bookkeeper had given it the once over, everything was perfect. great stock management system that ties in to the invoices and hooks in with the business bank account. this makes self assessments etc very easy and saves loads of time. very happy :)
great job. great app. very well designed and very user friendly
. good app
it's only a trial. this looks brilliant until you've set up the account only to find out that it's a 30 trial. by that time they've got your email. well done them. clever!! immediately deleted
constantly improving. great to see the new features, look forward to some more. smart, effect and smooth operations in all aspects of the software.
not very good. there seems to be issues here. a lot of errors with login on this updated app. as well as having to wait so long for funds to be deposited. not happy
. this app makes attaching pictures of paper receipts easy.
. this app hacked my phone and when i uninstalled it it reinstalled itself and destroyed my phone, do not install this app
lacking compared to ios version. the layout and functionality compared to the ipad version is horrible and hard to use. plus there is no way for the customer to sign for invoice or estimate on tablet or phone. i am an android fan all the way, but i am going to have to purchase an ipad to get the functionality i need. i am very disappointed.
. i love the way it keeps me up to date. this has really helped to keep me organized and i really like how easy it is to send invoices, accept payments and track their interactions with your company.
"not as good as it was.. getting worse. incorrect allocation of funds to invoices. the mobile app doesn't allow expense entering anymore (""we're working on it""  november 16). yes, you can see invoices and forward from the phone, but wouldn't want to do anything else. come on qb, get your act together. u.k."
. great app easy to use. love that i can upload my receipts
unresponsive. app not working not letting me update data for 5 days now. emailed company still not sorted still not happy
. still learning the ins and outs of the app, but so far i love
great except one thing.. i like everything except when the app times out while i‚Äôm trying to save an invoice that took me 5 minutes to write up!! and no when it does that it doesn‚Äôt save the invoice. other than that it‚Äôs good.
. quick books online is perfect for a small business owner like myself. i can have a professional bookkeeping,payroll, and tax service with also being able to provide estimates and invoices out in the field. its perfect!! thanks so much much quick books. trey blocker blocket tree service
can't bring myself to use it.. it's nowhere near as useful as the desktop app. i'd love to be able to create an invoice on my phone or tablet and upload photos right from the device. can't do it yet.
electrician. this is app for business
. great app really helps with all my business needs one thing short of five stars and that's an in app calculator!!!!
can‚Äôt create multiple companies. can‚Äôt create multiple companies or entities with this program. i would have to pay a subscription fee for each company. if i wanted to track my individual expense, my business expenses, and my llc expenses i would be stuck for $720 a year when the 2013 version on my laptop could create unlimited companies and only cost $300 paid in full.
easy and interlink. quick book is easy to use and able to interlink between my office pc with smart phone, ipad as well as bank accounts. it is making our accounting procedures easy.
. love the app. in the app we can schedule appointments. we need that feature for online with computer. can't be too hard to do.. thanks.
. very useful, easy to use on mobile or pc. i have had a little trouble getting funds transferred into my account.
touchid times out. unfortunately the touchid authentication doesn't work as you'd expect. the app constantly asks for you to enter a password even with it enabled.
. this has to be the worst app going zero customer support constantly lied too been trying for 3 weeks to send an invoice and they don't care as long as you keep paying absolute rip off...not far from being a scam spoke to managers about problems and still nothing done do don't waste your time or money...try any other program or stick to pen and paper far better and less stressful
convenient but you pay for it. this app is really handy but they jack the prices up on you once you‚Äôve gone through all the hassle of inputting your info. they know you won‚Äôt probably mess with changing programs once you‚Äôve wasted all that time and energy. it is nice to use, however.
ios 13. i‚Äôve updated my iphone 8 to ios 13 and quickbooks won‚Äôt load at all. i‚Äôve deleted and re uploaded the app and it‚Äôs the same. any updates coming soon for the app? other than that, don‚Äôt update your phone if you rely on quickbooks in your phone
basic business. although it does have obvious business needs covered. it doesn't offer the next step in organization. without the ability to create work orders, or track services performed. it remains a minuscule part of my daily business. it really doesn't have anything that separates itself from other simple invoicing programs or applications. it's cloud based convenience remains the reason for my usage.
vendor and po. need to add vendors and orders to the app
. great experience
upholstery shop. very good app
easy but very limited. maybe i was not schooled enough on the app, but i have the need to print reports and invoices. i could not find an option to that.
quickbooks online. this apps rocks!
. why can't i edit an invoice number? my only complaint is that i am unable to edit the invoice number. this prevents me from creating invoices on the go.
company owner. you can't go in an manage users unless you have a desktop version that's just not acceptable i have an ipad pro cost 3times what my computer cost it better get fixed or i am gone.very disappointed. also customer service can't help either rg
pretty basic and useless. edit: still can‚Äôt see monthly reports. i don‚Äôt need the annual pl as much as the monthly. can't do a lot of things. it's very very basic , pretty much a basic overview of your account. you can‚Äôt do anything even as detailed as seeing the transactions in a pl report. it‚Äôs only broad overview stuff and entering new transactions. can‚Äôt even switch cash vs accrual. severely limited and cannot work in a pinch when you can‚Äôt use an actual computer.
"convoluted. extremely difficult to navigate. what should be a simple site to use, turns out to be very convoluted. far, far too many ""choices"" on how to input invoiced paid. transferring data from your bank account is a nightmare. site keeps suggesting i've already added that data....saying, oops, you have a ""match"". welllll, yeeees, many of my monthly bills are exactly the same amount each month, a recurring bill. not a match. arrggggg"
. great app loving it
keep having to uninreinstall. i keep having to uninstall app then reinstall because it gives me a black screen, then closes out. this is the 2nd time i‚Äôve had to do this and it appears it may be a bug of sorts. overall happy with the app but please fix this glitch.
meh, no project profitability reports in the app. as a construction business all our accounting revolves around p&l reports per project. the onlinedesktop app gives us the project report but the app does not, which makes the app pretty much useless. our best solution is to login to our qbo account through safari on the phone to see the real time project profitability, shouldn‚Äôt the app do that?
disappointed with android app. the pc version is so slick but the android version is very disappointing. as this is cloud based there should be no reason for such limited functionality. where do i enter my expenses when out working? if i had an iphone i would be able to. come on lets have similar functionality to the pc version.
update make app worthless. thanks for the update that prevents me from sending invoices.
. i love the app so much, but if can add more function n reports in mobile app then is really perfect:) 23092019 i wish to ask, wether you can remove the function which not allowed to screenshot ? it is very frustrated when i need to inform my customer how much they owe. please !!!
very good. good job i would like to add pictures to the estimates i would like to see a calendar with all the jobs and i would like to drag them to change it to a different date
awesome!. this is app is like a holy grail! ‚ÄºÔ∏èüôåüèæ it works really well with my iphone tooüíôüíô
please add signatures options estimates!!!. i love this app but it could offer customer signatures agreeing to terms on invoiceestimates features. for example if i send an estimate via email, customers can reply back with a signed estimate allowing me on the other end to place order since i now have their consent. it will save me a trip on having drive out to their location for a signature. please add this feature!!! pretty pleaseeeee.
best app ever!. this app makes it easy to do all the things i need to do for my business. it allows for flexibility and mobility which is needed in a business like mine.
i love quickbooks online. i love quickbooks online & my accountant does also. this app is really good for doing your expenses on but as far as invoicing i still do it on the computer. it's very handy for a small business. the fact you can enter an expense, take a picture of the receipt & go on your merry way. i'm sold.
qb app no good!!!. quickbook online is fine where as the app has only limited features!!!
. great app for tracking expenses and payments
phenomenal. quickbooks app on my phone combined with the online system is the best thing to happen to my new small business. i no longer feel like an accountant full time & business owner part time!
. quick and easy to use. clients have been very receptive to there invoices or estimates. definitely have recommended this to other small business owners.
great app. i have numerous clients on this platform and it suits all forms and situations.
customer service & support sucks. go with freshbooks instead.
. awesome makes life easier for once
app. using this app is like being your own accountant. it helps keep track of your income and expenses. i highly recommend to all self employed people.
. awesome app for my business!
i like the app. quickbooks come with a handy app which is great. don't have to work only on desktop.
sales tax. cannot use the app on my phone because it does not calculate sales tax correctly. spoke with customer service. they know the issue and do not seem to think it‚Äôs important to fix it. makes the app almost useless to me
". mobile app is full of bugs, recent ""update"" has now made it so my account is unable to sync and wont let me log in. not very useful for my mobile business. tried reinstalling the app, still no luck. *tried clearing data, same issue."
"confusing and cluttered app. i love that nearly all of the features in the desktop app are here in the mobile app. however the interface, especially the home page, is confusing and cluttered. ""company activity"" is a bit useless as the default page. show me the charts of paidunpaid invoices. i think the developers are tasked with including every single feature and that clouds their design judgement. it's not an easy ask but let's make this app more mobile friendly."
. this app coupled with the web based app is the best thing i have seen for small business. cut book work down to an hour a night rather than 3. the ability to send both quotes and invoices on the go saves hours. works extremely well with the paid web app happy as with both
. good mobile app for finance
. since the update can't add trips for mileage. app was working perfectly before the update. app won't allow addresses to be added like before. why not just leave well enough alone?
. great product. very well developed app üëäüèø
pretty basic and useless. can't do a lot of things. it's very very basic , pretty much a basic overview of your account. you can‚Äôt do anything even as detailed as seeing the transactions in a pl report. it‚Äôs only broad overview stuff and entering new transactions. can‚Äôt even switch cash vs accrual. severely limited and cannot work in a pinch when you can‚Äôt use an actual computer.
disappointing update. was able to do deposit on the go with earlier version. please fix.
great app  easy to use. enough said. it helps me keep track of my invoicing as well as my expenses. great for small businesses.
"update broke the app. since the update i have to type my password each time i open it after it has been closed for a while. this doesn't work in front of customers. (yes, i enabled touchid. the problem seem to be hitting others and is based on now intuit decided to ""fix"" touchid by breaking it in this version)"
constantly freezes. no search option
unusable on ipad pro. was intending to transfer all of my business computing over to my more than capable ipad pro. intuit seems to have other ideas. unable to run my business with the quickbooks software with the app or through the browser. a very unsatisfactory situation having my computing need dictated by intuit. will change software as soon as practical.
improving. each new version a little better than the last. just like qb online for mac app, both need more features to compete with the rest of the qb product line.
tooooo good app for business. good to make business easy
doesn't work. app doesn't sync all data with quickbooks online. i see only my company name and customer list. no invoices, expenses etc. intuit support we're not able to help.
not reliable on weekends or holidays. times when i have to work on weekends or holidays i have the most issues logging in and being able to invoice customers. there is also times when i can‚Äôt login during the week, i‚Äôm guessing due to quickbooks working on servers! wish i could install as a program on my tablet instead of a app or still be able to use offline to print an invoice and receipt
. this app is not syncing my data from last 15 days. even support team is not responding with resoultion
. bad app
. needs lots of work yet. it's not fullfunction, and lists with subelements are totally useless. now that qboe is more tabletready, skip this app and go straight to qboe.intuit.com with your favorite browser.
. why is quickbooks on ios so much better ??? please update it to ios standards
crashes. it now crashes. tried several times. updated everything. looked at website  no help. very disappointed, we pay good money for this.
. very convenient it's a convenient and easy to use app. the only downfall is not being able to insert new fields. so a ;  )
still needs some changes. multiple addresses for a company is still a drama as it changes all pervious invoices and quotes. plus now on the ipad version it says i can't access until subscription is paid but it is.. works on computer but can't use my ipad. annoying!!!
fantastic app. love that you can attach photos on the fly!
. app hangs all the time, and pain to work with. waste of time
. love it, can do most things on my phone too, really useful for a tradesman
. good app works well on android
great app. love it real simple to use!!!
finally!. this app does all that i've wanted  expenses and all. good to se qbo is working at this. love the mobile experience.
easy and super user friendly. first time user of this type of app but it was easy to set up. sent out my first invoice after 1hr already.
when i am done, i am done!. as a contractor i love to do my estimates one time, hit convert to invoice one time, hit receive payment one time and i am done with my paperwork and money is heading my way before i leave the job site. when i get home i can just spend time with the family rather than swim through paperwork. great service!
works well!. this app does what i need it to do. i'm an electrical contractor and i'm able to do all the bookkeeping myself with just a little help. i like the ability to make invoices on the job, enter receipts at stores, and view the status of customers. i would suggest this for any small business. i use the basic service ($10mth) and it's well worth it.
great. it's a lot easier to use that the 10.0 version i had installed. love that i can invoice customers right thru email and get paid within 2 days!! linking bank accounts is is a huge plus too! ! i'm honestly excited about tax season this year!
invoice. the only thing i don‚Äôt like is you can‚Äôt easily adjust invoices.
. so simple to use
. best app
latest update crashing on iphone 7. app crashes 2sec after being turned on on iphone7. restarted phone, no luck
unable to access quickbooks through ipad. everytime time i try to access the quickbooks it says i need to verify first my login which can be verified by sending an email. when i choose this option it says the time has ran out and goes back to the login menu. i am able to get in through the web but never in the app
. user for 2 years, samsung s8, app fails to load now. when it did work, it never showed historical customer transactions. never properly refreshed bank connections oh, you would have to go to the online portal and update first before you could use or see your transactions on this app. i'm pretty fed up at this point with this app, only thing i really wanted to do at this point was use the receipt scanning but i can't even do that now. uninstalled..
down graded. from april this app is unusable. i down graded to qb online. it appears it was released about a year too soon. nothing but frustration from day one. the ipad and iphone is useless.
. be warned easy to subscribe almost impossible to cancel subscription has been at it for hours it seems like an undertaking of several days will try again tomorrow.
does not show suppliers. since update app does not show suppliers or let you add expense, which makes mobile app a waste of time
smart. smart move to have quickbooks for a small business owner. makes it easier to do my job  one man show !!!! ces lico
. very user friendly
love it. i love the quickbooks program because all of my employees can log into the program from different locations at the same time.
silly errors. there are a few silly things that would be so easy to correct. invoice design, and worst of all sending a customer a copy of a paid invoice shows invoice amount as 0.00. not the actual amount and paid.
. want to cancel my subscription doesn't even tell me how.
great mobile app, but it has a mind of its own. i've found the ability to work remotely as a great plus for estimates, electronic invoices and checking customer records. i have just had issues with downloaded deposit amounts and matching for reconciliation. automatic entry into register has to go!
switching between companies. how come i cannot switch companies? cannot run p&l and balance sheet based on dates?
. disapointed and just hated
hopeless. ever since my accountant asked to use it, the app is never able to retrieve any data keeps giving a message to say ‚Äòunable to retrieve data‚Äô. what‚Äôs the point of the app if i can‚Äôt see the dashboard and data when i need to?
refund made impossible. i‚Äôve been making payment on this stupid app not using it at all. there‚Äôs no easy way to refund or unsubscribe this stupid app. who do i bring the attention to since quickbook site says they have nothing to do with the billing and subscription?
spotty & unreliable. i rarely review any apps that i use unless they are particularly great or particularly terrible. in this case, sadly it is the latter. this app doesn't have basic features that should be included, and about half of my invoices i cannot open from the app because apparently it uses some feature in their api that is nonsupported or not working. regardless, if you are looking for a 21stcentury accounting solution and app this is sadly not it at all.
more than convenient, it's necessary. having the app makes it so much easier to do business on the go. you can send estimates and invoices before the client meeting has even ended. efficient and essential!
quickbooks online. does everything i need without problems.
bad app! bad app!. i loved the app... then it fell apart. i cannot get it to show current status on anything! why is it so hard to keep a good app 'good' ??
won't sign in, incorrect subscription error.. like the title says, can't login tells me my subscription may have expired. i can log in through website easily.
crashed when entered a sales transaction. downloaded this app to see if i could use it instead of at a computer and the app crashed as soon as i tried to enter a sales transaction. i tried to enter in the receipt type and it crashed
great app. app is never up today's with invoices. the app has become useless to me other than being able to find customers phone numbers and addresses. please fix asap.
. awesome app. very handy very easy to use. highly recommended!.
qb ol user. i almost can't believe they actually released this to the public. it is only half an accounting system. all you can do is see outstanding invoices. it is at best a limited reporting system. it is not a way to control a business.. a long way to go before even thinking about paying $0.99 for it ..
. this app is fo real ya'll
new update. i love the app and it has been great for us for years. however, the new update does not allow a custom date range for reports and when you edit an invoice it gives you a small screen that not everything fits on. please bring back the custom date range and make is so we can see everything on edits.
all you need to run a business.. awesome app. all your accounting needs are build into the app. very easy to use.
transactions import. major problem is transactions import . i spent a week looking for the right tool that is compatible with qbo. then i discovered that it will not import because my country that is registered in my account is not usa!!! why qbo doesn't have import transactions feature same as customer import
. can't view emails that it sends, it doesn't track when reminders are sent on past due invoices, you can not offer multiple terms (i.e. invoice net 30 but offer a net 15 discount if they pay early). tech support wait times are extensive (40 min on one call, 20 min on a chat). all that and it's expensive.
don't bother. been using qb desktop for years. disapointed in the sasmobile version. mobile app is slow and frequently fails to load at all. not much functionality at all besides creating invoices. checking account balances or customer ar is not worth the bother on mobile app. this is an ok solution. i bet there are better options available than qb mobile app.
like it but needs more features. i can do everything i need to from this app. i would like to see the ability to create purchase orders and pay bills & i just wish they had more integration with paypal.
very intuitive. incredible app. i find it easier to use than the desk top version.
. for a mobile business this app works great
how bad????. i would love to write a review, but as i've been trying to get this app to log in to my online account for 5 months now it's going to be a little difficult. but not as difficult as trying to get any customer support for this app. i could write a whole book on how impossible that is. so so disappointed. no help with this problem what so ever. frustrated!!!!!
excellent app. keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
don't do it. can't bill a portion of a estimate have to bill it all at once! it will not let you see your job costs per estimate! this is a huge deal i can't believe they haven't fixed this yet. come on qb add another freaken column already! tones of other stuff on the accounting side that i don't know about is missing as well!
"latest upgrade is a disgrace. i have never written a negative review of an upgrade, but the latest version of this app made a great app totally useless. you can no longer receive invoices or reconcile bank balances. do yourself a favor and delete the quickbooks app rather than ""upgrade."" the mobile website is more useful than the app."
exactly what i need. amazing app and way simple to use!
. android user app is convenient and easy to maneuver. i lile that i can remain productive on the go!
. get error message when i login on a mobile phone. works fine in mobile browser and on the desktop. app used to be great but cant even access the tools that i'm paying for anymore
. for what i do this was a complete waste of money. . it was supposed to import all my all my spreadsheet and all that information over to my taxes when i signed up with tax turbotax or whatever it was. it doesn't nor did it. and now it keeps trying to charge me $60 for something after i cancel my subscription because all it did was make my taxes more complicated than they had to be.
makes life simple. makes keeping the books alot simpler. cits down on time spent in the office
. sluggish, cant get bank account info. each log in was a hassle. i uninstalled it after 2 days. is this the beta?
. can retrieve the old account but it won't re activate. created a new account and password.. can't log in. seems to be an app issue or software
. so far so good. my business isn't big so this software is just enough.
would be better if i could manage payroll on the app. i would love to be able to do up my company‚Äôs payroll on the fly if i‚Äôm out on a job site or on a business trip. please fix this
easy to work with. loving it
. tr√®s efficace
missing time activities feature. this app is pretty good for the most part, however, it is missing the time activities feature like on the browser based software. please add this feature!!
only basics. the app appears to make available only the very basic functions. i don't see reports, and i signed on to complete some company preferences, add classes, and set opening chart of accounts. none of these are functional.
. good app. have a few things i would like to see added. i have made suggestions and am sure they will accommodate in due course. makes me more efficient. have come to rely on app and would have otto spend a lot more time on data entry and research without it.
awesome app. i really like this app, i can track all my incomes and expenses, it shows my net profit and everything else i could possibly need. i really enjoy using this app.
awesome app, love quickbooks. use it often to add expenses and check bank data. nice feature of receipt photo, works great
good but app missing functionality. the app does not compare to the desktop version. the app does not show menu item for employees. i am using android and have reinstalled as advised by qb support but it makes no difference.
gret app. i love this app but the reason i didn't give it a 5 is because when you enter an expense with the app and write who you paid and save the expense when you go to the computer it does not show who you paid. that field is blank.
. good app really i enjoy working with it
still missing a lot.... if i can't manually or automatically integrate my bank account, then that's something huge missing. when you have an idea that is usable worldwide then you make it as easy as possible to use. bottom line: i want to be able to add my bank account manually and see bank transactions on the dashboard since my country's banks are not supported. more so,it takes forever to open
owner. great app
good app.
mgrm. great app. useful and easy to use. sample and easy to use
. great program for keeping track of your expenses and income.
track time. so far i‚Äôm pretty unhappy with this app because i thought that i could use it to track my time while i was with a client with a timer. i know that i read that somewhere when i was researching this app. that would have been a perfect feature. if this is something that i can actually do and someone can let me know how to do it i will change my rating to 4 or 5 stars.
great app. been with quickbooks for two years now and still really impressed very easy to use and works across all platforms would strongly recommend
. lo ove it. load expenses with receipt easily
quickbooks online + app. quickbooks online is making my business accounts so easy. the bank connections feature allows you to sync online accounts straight into your account records. when new transactions are available, you can view and add them straight into your accounts, made easier by quicbooks match feature that marks transactions with previous similar transactions. support during setup period has been excellent which has made switching from another online accounting software quite an easy process. very impressive so far.
. often fails to sign in. limited app that hardly works. skip the download and just visit the website.
touchid. touchid or pincode does not seem to work for login. it never gets asked when the app starts even after enabled. please fix. thanks.
. awesome. not a tech savvy guy. super easy for me to invoice and track my business.
. great software !!!
great accounting software. after using qb software for many years, i switched to qb online as a happy customer. i advise qb online especially if you are in wholesale trading.
labour cost per customer?. i run a construction company. my business in the cloud is perfect! however job cost tracking per customer still does not include labour cost in its report. i still have to do this manually. all the payroll info is in sync with the t sheets program so i don't understand why we can't get a profit and loss statement to include the labour tagged to that jobcustomer.
terrible product. if you are looking for comprehensive business software that is easy to use and reliable, you won't find it with quickbooks online. after using the desktop versions for years, the online version is just a sad attempt. i had high hopes when i started using the online version. within minutes, i was disappointed.
. loved it, but acting up again. when i add something to an invoice (on s8) then hit done, the refreshed invoice lines are all out of order and duplicated. uninstalled and reinstalled, still doing it. not working on tablet either. please fix asap. update: seems to be fixed now. thank you
awesome.. works great for invoicing and reports. love being able to email and print invoices and estimates from my phone. i don't use it for payroll.
. not for india.. then why the hell u give option of india in menu .. if ur app is not compatible in india..
awesome app!. great product, has everything our small business needs, saved us a lot of time transferring from one program to this. reconciliation is a dream, so simple and easy to work out. have had no issues whatsoever and am very happy with the change over, has made life so much easier. üëç thank you
bon d√©but, good start!. the online qb 2014 interface is a big wow! but this one is not yet reaching the expectations, it¬¥s a good beginning, bon d√©but. when do you add french and spanish languages?
very easy to hand on. cloud solution made bookkeeping much easier
nice app. i really like this app, but wish it was a little easier to navigate and do more.
. great app
worth it could be improved. works well, my only complaint is different functions are available or not available depending on how you access quickbooks. can be a little frustrating when i need to send an account statement and have to do it from a pc as that option seems to be absent on iphone and ipad access. better than my other invoice options by far worth using for sure.
fantastic software.. i'm very satisfied with the quickbooks software
love it. amazing i don't know what i would do without this app.
linked bank account. locked out. no customer service.. there is literally no phone support whatsoever for the mobile app. i'm still locked out of this app after linking my checking account.
. this app makes my life so much easier.
crashes. app is unusable after ios 13.0 update.. crashes. app is unusable after ios 13.0 update.
. wonderful app
. loving using this software, helping me heaps
latest update won't open!. latest update crashes immediately.
awesome app!:. this is perfect for on the go invoices and quotes for businesses.
. brilliant software
great app so far. great app. one thing needed i‚Äôd making it easier to change customers info when doing a new invoice for a previous customer but at a new address.
love it!. i am a locksmith, need an easy and efficient easy to manage invoicing, books, transactions... qbo has saved me hours every night logging and sending invoices, billing, and balancing my books through my bank. i send invoices on the fly now, and all of the related bookwork is completed simultaneously... seriously wonder how i found the time to complete everything this does for me from my phone or tablet in my car. a real time saver!
. easy to use, very useful when on the go!
disappointed. just updated to the latest version and this app is crashing all day i can‚Äôt even use it normally i need to log on 10 times to write one customer i can‚Äôt run my business normally like this please fix asap the app tells me you need to do critical updates. idiot i juts updated the app and now it crashes ever time i open it
limited features. i‚Äôm not sure why quickbooks decided to create an app that is so much different than the web version or the mac version. errors and limited information is all this thing is good for. and, if you decide you would rather just use the website, you pretty much get redirected to this junky app.
. the app works really well. it takes a little getting use to...but once you get it, it's a great tool!
logs out every time  please fix this!!. for the last few weeks every time i login it says there are critical updates and i need to log out and back in. every time. nothing changes or updates. very frustrating.
must have accounting tool. i don't see how we managed without it before! everything is easy! the two factor authentication gives me a piece of mind. if you choose to use 2fa, then go with google authenticator and avoid the txt code. there are still problems with txt codes and you can get locked out. i figured a way around it on my own. unfortunately quickbooks was unable to help me with the lock out issue. other than that it's allll gooood!
. i have been missing out, i wish i would have used this a long time ago. makes doing business anywhere much easier.
. must have app for a small business
great updates and really user friendly. all works better than before and integrates brilliantly. makes understanding our financials a doddle!
forced payroll system not working. since march 2017 our payroll that they force you to pay for if you have employees has not working correctly. edd efile is non existent, cannot archive reports, and irs efile is sporadic. customer service wont credit any amount nor can they fix the problem even after ‚Äúescalating‚Äù it to priority customer support. three ‚Äúcases‚Äù opened, none of which fixed the problem. do not buy this product.
used to love it.... ever since the app was updated, i can no longer get past the sign in screen on my galaxy note 5. at least it still works on my ipad i guess...
great app to keep your business organized. inuit has come along way
. i like everything, really good app to use!!! you guy, still need to work on user friendly things.
. can't down load the app
electric company. quickbooks is the best invoicing program i have found.
. very miss leading and is nothink like the tv advert. not to easy to use and over all disappointed. having to use it because of my accountant. no impressed!!!!
. free try option does not work. what's the fun of offering trial that doesn't work
some problems. when it works it's great, i use it every day and every day there is a problem, the system tells me they are having problems, please try again later, takes forever to send email. it's very frustrating when you have a business on the go.
underdeveloped & terrible support. the software is totally undeveloped and does not have the features of the regular desktop version. tech support is horrific, they can't help because they don't have the knowledge. intuit had no business releasing the software to the public it's not even ready for beta yet. the iphone app is worthless!
love this app and online version of qb üò¨. i converted to the online version of qb from the desktop version and i have to say it was the best decision i made! my primary laptop crashed & nothing could not be recovered, the online version of qb was never an issue & continued seamlessly. this app is such a convenient perk to qb  i can't say enough how fabulous this app is. love it!
there‚Äôs just 1 thing... i have been loving the way this program functions. the only thing i continually wish for is that i would be notified when a customer opens an estimate, not just the invoice.
. one of the best accounting software's i have used for my business on the go.
. does every thing i need it to do, and i can do it on my phone. so easy to navigate. wouldn't want to run my business without it.
. great inaccessibility to app
mario osorio painting and a&t housecleaning. love this program very friendly and very easy to understand for my self and my bookkeeper.
. quickbooks online is awesome and is super valuable for my business, i am not one to recommend, but it saves me hours and i recommend it to everyone. the desktop program is great that i download for my pc, it has all the same useful features as the online platform. the apps are not the same. they are missing a lot of the features, and frankly useless. i typically just login through the browser with my android tablet and iphone....sorry just the truth!
fantastic app for my ipad pro!. i recently acquired an ipad pro to use for my business and instantly downloaded quickbooks to use on the go. this app has been wonderful for sending invoices, logging my expenses, and managing the books in general. so far, i have yet to experience a crash and everything has been working well for my needs!
stopped working on samsung galaxy s6. never had a problem with the app till about 3 weeks ago. it stopped working on my samsung galaxy s6 for no reason. i'm a small business that's on the road a lot and need to be able to send invoices on the spot. please fix it.
. awesome. very easy to navigate. amazing to be able to do all this from my phone.
. when it works it works great. however i have to periodically delete and reinstall the app because it gets buggy entering new expenses. it will get locked in the expense screen. in the locked screen if i hit save 5 times it will record the transaction 5 times while still sitting in the entry screen.
. great app a bit overwhelming at first with all the features.
awesome app. works great for my mobile detail business.
great app. convenient. quickbooks app is very easy to use and makes tracking expenses quick and easy.
great app and accounting. excellent accounting software and a great app as well. nice work qb!
outstanding accounting software. perfect for sme's. enter bills and invoices on the go including taking photos of your receipts and signatures for invoices. absolutely outstanding accounts package, i couldn't recommend it more, well done intuit!
. it needs customizable products and services. it updates to often.
. very good, i am on trial not sure how much full experience will cost, i'll update when i can
can‚Äôt record invoice payments. i upgraded my phone from an iphone 8 plus to an xr running ios 13. i installed the quickbooks app from the apple store. when i try to record invoice payments, i get the following error: qbm.error.00001160.reason.iphone i have not found any articles about this error online.
issues with addresses being in window of envelope. i used to be able to print off invoices and mail them to customers by folding in thirds. now i have to fold a special way to get the address to appear in the windows of the envelope.
awsome. very good program has helped me a lot.
waugh and son's marketing.. great app lets me check what's on my computer and add little things when needed.
export. does everything i need it to do but can't export your data on a mac. also crashes in ios 11 beta but not holding that against them since i'm using beta version of ios. works find on my phone using ios 10
lame and useless. don‚Äôt waste your time punching in a bunch of data only to have limited access to reports and editing. total bs.
. slow, laggy and pretty featureless
. usefull and effective. it needs improvement in its mobile features. creating delivery challan and entering gst details while adding new customers isn't available currently. hope to see this feature soon in the app
ease of use app. loving to use app on phone writing invoices.
no supplier invoice. invoices from suppliers can not be captured on the app. you have to log onto the main website  which is extremely slow and cluttered to navigate on a mobile phone.
poor design. very hard to navigate and understand. customer service only works bankers hours and not when you need them.
cis transactions. cannot carry out cis transactions in the app for some reason, you have to use the web version. this is really annoying and somewhat inconvenient. other than that, a great app....
. i messaged support about my subscription it was not what i wanted. i cancelled the account last month and was still billed and on the subscription. would like a refund on my card
great app. it's quick and easy to learn. prefect for me.
. problems sending invoices. update to customers from ipad doesn't always work. other issues. still a good app.
excellent. i am a pro exterminator and i have been using this app since i launched my company federal bug investigators in 2012. it's features are amazing and allow me to create an invoice, charge a card on the spot and more, while out in the field or away from the office. thanks to this technology i am an elite entrepreneur.
. the biggest reason i use quickbooks is to see how much inventory i have. can't do that on the phone app what's the point of having it!
. as an business owner best and very useful application. thank you quickbook
. works we so far. just started using it. i like that i can create and send invoices from my phone.
returning to qb. uk staff still rude and unhelpful.
love it. great software when teamed up with abdroid app
useless  data download errors. the app worked great for the past couple years and now all the sudden it keeps crashing when trying to download my data. i own a mobile business and now i'm having to preplan and print invoices before i show up because the app is useless.
help. hate trying to get help this way, but my app keeps crashing. i love my online version, but basically i can‚Äôt do anything with the app. would make my life so much easier if i could
. propaganda enganosa falava qu e o aplicativo estava media de 13 reais fiz a assinatura sem o primeiro m√™s de teste j√° quererem cobrar quase 49 reais n√£o quero isso por favor cancele. al√©m de n√£o dar para usar um aplicativo t√£o complicado agora anuncia um valor barato depois cobra mais de 3 vezes esse valor. cancele n√£o quero. nem usei. instalei hoje e j√° estou desinstalando.
. someone is lazy this app does not work well will allied irish bank since the bank updated its security features and its been months i reported the issue no one wants to take action. sad enough is that i am still paying for it every month.
good program. been using this software for about 6 months now and find it very useful as a sole trader it works for me i can pick up my phone and write an invoice straight away.
. litterally trash. never works. double invoices . deletes things. stayed loyal as they have promised fixes for over a year now. nothing but a waste of time
unable to signinüôÖ. moto g turbo : error says i don't have online subscription,reported via email, no responseüò°
"love it but it could be better. i want to give it 5 stars but due to the fact that my customers can't view their quickbooks invoices and receive an message saying ""error we can't retrieve the requested invoice"". please fix this issue asap so my customers can pay me! thank you."
great app!. just need the ability to take a photo of a receipt and upload it and then it'll be 5 stars (i understand this is something that the online application is lacking as well)
crashes. won't open. immediately crashes. please fix
. great app! makes running my business so much easier
. app banking does not work on android pixel 3. crashes as its loading transactions. i called quickbooks and got the runaround, didnt take my issue seriously. stuck using computer
good expense tracker. good for tracking expensing. everything else really needs to be done from the desktop version. handy little app, but it needs some work to truly run things from this app.
great app. awesome app
decent....but needs work. the mobile app is laid out decent and does work well for the most part. biggest problem i have is you cannot access product quantities or make any purchase orders with the mobile app. need to fix that.
. i like the relatively seamless access from desktop, internet and mobile app
not particularly useful. the service is so limited can't even check account balences making the app mostly useless. i'll delete now.
bs you suck!. h8 it when the bastards don't tell you its a trial. free means free you idiots!
. absolutely overwhelming! you surround yourselves with the most incredible and pleasant staff. bill, just like the the other individuals that i talked with in the last two days are extraordinary and simply the best. thanks a lot for all your help. pedro
doesn't start. after asking credentials it says that problem occurred and reverts back to signing in. it doesn't say that either user or pass incorrect  simply says error and suggests to send message.
excellent for businesses in the go!. quickbooks is easy to use and the app allows me to create transactions, view balances and customer information wherever i am. i also love that i can take a photo of a receipt and categorize it on the go.
good unless u need their help. i had a problem as accidentally created 2 companies in the one profile. subscription applied to wrong company and they had no idea how to fix it. the company with all my accounting was cancelled as ‚Äòtrial ended‚Äô but other company with no data was fully subscribed. very frustrating when dealing with idiots in the phone!
doesn't work!. it hardly used to work, now it doesn't work at all. my boss is constantly on me for missing invoices, well i can't make them because the app doesn't work! crashes immediately when i try to open it. when it does open, it will let me sign in then give me an error.
slow, expensive and with poor support. i have been using quckbooks for a year now. it's terribly slow on here and also on the pc, the support is dire, and mostly just does not respond. the only thing that happens quickly in this app is the removal of service if you fail to pay your subscription. avoid! now i'm looking for an alternative that i can migrate my business info etc to without too much fuss.
needs help. need to adjust the address in the statement area. doesn't fit in the window of envelope. checked the help box, several others having same problem.
. efficient, easy to use
. this app has made life much easier and more organized
app is not functional. the app is keep crushing on iphone xs max every time you i want to create new invoice. billion dollar company but cannot fix bugs for a few months already, its embarrassing.
too slow. too slow, freezes, doesn't show if the email has been sent and other things... quick sale is way better.
good apps. it's okay
. takes ages to load then crashes to a black screen. i have had the app for 3 months or so and only ever got it working for a few moments once. as it is so unreliable i could not trust it as an app to rely on, for example to use in front of a customer in their home, therefore i cannot recommend this app. i run a ltd company and we use qb as our accounting software.
let's me keep my members accounts current. i need to be able to scan credit card's and and take payments from my members at our weekly meetings and this app helps me see their balance and details at a glance. i'd be lost without it.
missing my favorite feature of quickbooks. i have used quickbooks for about 25 years and the best feature was the find button. the way you could specify by date, invoice, customer name. i have searched for it and can't find it. if i'm overlooking it please let me know where. it's how i proceed with everything i do and it makes it very quick! please help or add this feature.
. great app! i do wish the pricing was lower
don't like new update. i prefer buttons actions on the bottom than puede corner and still missing two things, send invoices by text, fax, edit or view notes online
app, subscription. cannot updat subscription gives error on can‚Äôt upload data, now expired, very frustrating need solution
quickbook. on trial will notify later
quickbooks lies again. this app does not track mileage as advertised
game changer!!!. highly recommend qbo for any business trying to keep up with the cloud. the cloud is the future. for our needs converting to qbo from desktop was the winning choice. qb is constantly improving and it shows. we had a lot of people advising us to dive into the desktop version more but i followed my gut feeling. glad i did. it's my opinion that the desktop will be a dinosaur very soon.
great. great app i use it everyday, makes invoices a breeze and makes it easier at the end of the year for tax purposes.
love it. love it. the version on my computer is great. this app is a little unintuitive but if you understand what you're doing it's not bad!
. great app
. i'm having trouble getting this app to download to my tablet everytime i try it tells me its already downloaded but to my phone? can i only download on one device? thanks nell
"about 710. not bad but not good. the app keeps requiring updates if used on apple products. not an issue but the updates never appear. quickbooks blames apple and apple blame quickbooks. we ""updated to the cloud version"" from a pcm based quickbooks. so far we are very very disappointed."
". just signed up. you get a 24hr trial and then it asks you to spend $7.99mo with a 30% off discount (not sure if that is included, or what). so much for a ""free"" app."
. banking information is typically two days old. honestly it's a pointless app without an option to update banking information. i don't understand why this is not possible on androids. i was able to retrieve updated banking information on my iphone. banking data on the android app is up to 2 full days old. this means a trip back to the office for certain financial decisions and renders reports useless. it's a financial system. banking is a fairly important component of a business' finances!
qbooks is a entrepreneur's dream. i've been doing bussines as general contractor the last 20 yrs, always i tried to find a software where i can handle all my administrative information at all (invoicing, payroll, expenses) with this apps you can get everything at your fingers reach, so you can control all money inout. it's a world marvel!
. qbo is great... however, the app sucks! the info on the home page is rarely if ever correct. paid invoices show as still do, p&l info is incorrect compared to what it shows on the website. now i can't edit downloaded transaction to add an image of my receipts. plus, it's no longer showing all of my accounts when i go to categorize a transaction. what the heck happened?!
. every invoice i have done since the beginning of 2017 says 90 plus days past due
way too limited. i can‚Äôt even use the app to see if a bill was processed. it only allows you to view check or ach transactions and deposits. checks processed through bill pay don resigister as activity.
. i trust this app
annoyed again!!. i did the latest update and now i can‚Äôt even open this damm app! terrific ay! any suggestions qb‚Äôs!? can you get this sorted asap. a few updates prior to this lasted one, after that particular update all my company details except my abn disappeared, why? the app didn‚Äôt seem to save my details properly as i added them and it was like that until the following update. then everything was back to normal. pretty annoying!!
. smooth interface. easy invoicing.
wow! loving the switch!. it's more than i had ever expected. using square or other solutions or good old fashion checks in the mail are nothing compared to how seamless qbo has made my life. that mac app, ipad app, iphone app and even the apple watch app give me the pulse on our company that i've needed for so long. can't wait to grow into more solutions with qbo!
inexplicably no timesheet support in app. the most obviously missing feature is time sheet support. the support team is also quite useless and closes cases without resolving them or providing any assistance.
bad update. was close to perfect, or at least practical. since the last update, this app is useless to me. hoping this will change!
awful. i don‚Äôt typically leave negative reviews but if i have to watch an invoice that i am editing disappear one more time i‚Äôll loose my mind. clunky and prehistoric programme pen and paper would be quicker
. great app. makes it easier to run my business
convenient and efficient. this app allows me to create invoices and collect for my plumbing services in the field and takes care of the book keeping simultaneously! i can also email the invoice to my customer instantly, which my customers seem to appreciate.
invaluable tool!. qbo app is invaluable for me as a small business owner. having access to all my funicular data, customer records and invoicing is fantastic! the app works flawlessly.
makes business smooth and efficient.. i am self employed and have been using the pro version for several years now. it makes business documents and transactions smooth and organized. i take credit card payments via invoices. worked great for me and my clients.
. well after the experience so far it's great when i need to merge all apps at home then i can rate better. customer service has been just awesome so far. thanks it makes tracking expenses easy as taking a picture and putting the irs info in.
. great app, really so much better than anything else, there are a few things i would like to improve my experience... hard to explain... but i'll try... when i assign expenses on my phone, i have to go on to a desktop to tick billable.... does that make sense?
not work in india.. i have installed it, but when i open it. it show that it is not work in india. i have hear abt this app, that it is very good in it field but what if it not work in my country.
. dashboard unable to load after dozens of reinstalls, reboots and even on another phone entirely. ever since the new redesign the app has been riddled with intermittent loading of the dashboard to now nonexistent. tmobile, oneplus 6t tmobile, samsung galaxy note 10+
nothing adds up. when you run a business you want your numbers correct. i don't have time to troubleshoot why your software can't add a simple paypal balance and leaves transactions out. your fired!
. this good app
very easy and intuitive. i love how easy quickbooks online makes it the keep up with my invoicing and expenses. whether its on my phone or on the computer i can quickly and easily get the business part out of the way so i can get back to what i love to do.
. i would love for this app to work as it would be a great tool. would be way way better if i could enter data even when qb says (incorrectly) there is no internet, and it could sync later.
awesome accounting app. it's user friendly. moreover, tutorial videos are available if have any difficulty.
qb app. it's been a great app, very user friendly. getting better every update nice new features and look.
great when working. this app is a great app , however every time that apple do an update it seems to cause issue in regards to the program recognising that you have a up to date subscription
mobile app. convenient.
unusable. can't even log in. really disappointing. the ability to conduct business while on my route is crucial and i have never been able to get this app to work.
. why can't i login
"issues. it was working fine on my ipad up until last week. then starting bugging. not all customer transaction appear on the mobile app. called customer service about it. they told me that they were ""working on it"". we shall see. i pay for it monthly...i asked if i still had to pay this month even though it's not working as advertised...answer was yes. not happy with that answer. i will keep you posted. bob"
. great app
engineering team won‚Äôt fixed the azlo banking glitch.. i‚Äôve been trying to connect my azlo bank account to quickbooks for months. i‚Äôve been on the phone and computer with tech support multiple times and every time i‚Äôm told it is being worked out. how long could it possibly take? you all need to pay some attention to this matter please.
great app. this app is great and it supports an even greater cloudbased accounting programme, i wish i had started to use it sooner. it is making my life so much easier.
life saver. one my favorite apps to use while working. i‚Äôm on it like a social media page. thanks quick books.
managing partner at green mesa capital, llc. a very useful app. i can do everything i want through this app. in addition, the app has features the browser does not have, like the expense receipt capture.
great app. love it! easier than the desktop version!
excellent. wonderful tool  has improved use of foreign currency transactions.
ne pas acheter. honn√™tement j ai rarement vu un support aussi difficile. des bogues, des manques de fonctionnalit√©s, etc. pas au point pour les entreprise...
". why can i view expenses but not bills? this should be an essential part of the app, not a ""feature"" that may or may not be added in the future."
quickbooks app. great, convenience of creating, editing and sending invoices and adding customers, payments or expenses
. just started using qb after 19 years of sage, i must say their customer service is great and i'm using it for 2 business now.
very good for my small business needs. having used the full desktop version for 10+ years. the mobile version has been great,won't do everything the full version does. but suits my needs. and i'm still learning all its functions,but happy so far.
a great app. this app is a great compliment to the online service. i can't imagine running my business without it.
app notifications. app has issues which never get fixed. always receive a bug upon opening, can‚Äôt connect to bank account until refreshed, deleted invoices won‚Äôt delete, i no longer receive notifications when customers make payments. tried reinstalling, nothing works. how do i get this corrected?
simple and magnificent. love it. that is all. üòÄ
why doesn't it update banking?. all i want to do is import my banking transactions and deal with them. i would think this would be basic functionality. i spent spent over half an hour on the phone with support and talked to 3 different reps who ll claimed to know almost nothing about the app. seriously, why do you even have it.
great little app. excellent app for basic book keeping invoicing etc and keep up with the book keeping on the fly. but to do the serious stuff you still need to work from a laptop or desktop.
yeah. works great, limited on mobile app!
one word. awesome. i love this cause i can store all the receipt online.
support?? wats that??. if you are a person that will ever be involved in actually doing business in the real world, don't waste your time on this. if you ever need an answer at the speed of business in the real world, don't waste your time. you're not worth the expense. actual rating is 5, but the scale won't let me show the truth.
. very user friendly
amazing app!!. our business reconciliation just became simplified. easy to use and online access allows us to work on the go. highly recommend if you wish to save time.
great complement to quickbooks online. not the full program, but it makes it easy to keep up to date with expenses on the fly.
. great app! helps me stay organized on the go.
access. this app is great. it is so nice to be out in the field looking at a project and make an estimate right then and there while things are fresh in your mind. not to mention for the quick service call we are able to make our invoice right there and present it when we are complete with the work. aloha po'okela lawn service kailua, hawaii
getting frustrated. i hate that the computer version keeps crashing. the app is nice but doesn't have all the features of the web version (or if they are there i haven't found them yet!)
can't add or view expenses. the expenses option is not available! so why to have this app then?
not accurate, crashes often. this app goes from being usable to worthless on a whim. it also does not show simple things like how many $ in open invoices, (right now it says we have $488 in total receivables, when we have way more). the desktop app is fine, the ios app needs a ton of work.
. great app, much easier to invoice customers.
business owner. this app has all the features i need to run a small but quickly growing business. easy to navigate.
great app.. not as good as desktop. its amazing app and each update is awesome. but it's not as near the desktop in terms of functionality. overall, if you use quickbooks then its a must have..
could be better. it doesnt give you an option to enter a vendors bill on the app, its not convent to aways have to log onto a computer to enter a bill. you arent even able to review outstanding vendor bills etc on the mobil app
great app really does work for my business. really easy to do my accounts and invoices.
crashes on open. useful app until this update. it crashes on open, both on ipad and iphone. cannot do business this way...
too slow. too slow, freezes, doesn't show if the email has been sent and other things... quick sale is way better.
customer service and functions. you can be completely locked out upon renewal of your subscription. it has locked me out of entering for the last six days. tech support has been pretty useless at fixing it. with all the other flaws the online program has, avoid with every thing you have. you get no back up, high incompatibility, and many accountants hate it. your emailed invoice has a habit of hitting the spam bin,it isn't even compatible with other intuit products. avoid avoid avoid
quick as a wink. very handy and does the job.
great app. easy to use when on the go.
. this is a wonderful app. it now makes my work so easy and accurate..
excellent. really good app. carry your whole business in your pocket.
great app love it !!!. makes my work so much easier
nothing quick about quick books. not easy and not quick. out of all the invoice apps i‚Äôve used this has been the most awkward
problem with update please fix. iphone x, after updating the app, it doesn‚Äôt let me edit any transactions at all, i can only approve what is recognized transaction, an unrecognized transaction is not responsive to touchscreen commands so i have to cancel edit. please fix
works amazing! i love being able to attach pictures right to my expenses when i enter them. it is also really nice to be able to enter expenses on the road. it makes bookkeeping a lot easier!
stuck in data download. can't open app on ipad or iphone. stuck in a data download loop. support says there are no known issues, what a joke.
. really good for simple operations i only needed the app for a small subset of operations.... that is, quickly open,edit, and send an invoice. i am thankful for that capability. perhaps intuit could stress that the app is not intended to be full blast qbo.
signing out.... ugh this app keeps signing me out in the middle of my work.. please fix this soon. üòû
. very user friendly!
not tablet friendly. i use this everyday but the biggest problem is the tablet version is not very good when doing estimates, the format is completely different than the pc version
. very helpful. great job on the app
. great app. but wish they would integrate more reports on the mobile app. sometimes on the road these reports are crucial, but there is no access to them in the app.
"love this app!. love this app but it would be great if they allow me to include ""shipping date"" for the invoices generated on mobile"
small business accounting. as an it consultant for luk solutions... your computer service specialist... this is the perfect app for me. it helps me to see everything whilst on the go. i highly recommend it for any small business person. it is not as robust as the desktop model, but does mostly all you need in a bind whilst out of office.
good for basic functions.. would be better if invoices that are sent could have the ability to pay online, luke when being sent from desktop. more invoice history also..limited to 50 right now.
excellent. really good app. carry your whole business in your pocket. 6 months of using it and it's excellent.
great app. i don't understand what some people are complaining about it. this app works great. thank you
pretty good. we are using this to operate our plumbing & heating company and love it so far. it's missing a few features and wasn't the easiest to setup, but hopefully it will continue to be developed. great for us so far! everyone from management to sales to technicians are on the same page!
. i have seen personal budgeting apps that have better user experience than this. here just some of the glaring issues:  it forces you to relogin alot, and it does not support google signin, which means you have to retype a complex password every single time  you could use pin login from settings, but it is useless..  it forces pin code reentry everytime you use the camera or switch to another app.
outstanding. just download it!
touchid times out. unfortunately the touchid authentication doesn't work as you'd expect. the app constantly asks for you to enter a password even with it enabled.
. i just started trying my hands on an accounting software and i think quickbooks the best. as a student and a beginner quickbooks is easy to use and easy understand.
impressed. i put off upgrading to online version after using quickbooks pro for five years, struggling to enter online direct debit expenses and payments. online version makes entering data easy and efficient. such a time saver for me. well done intuit! definitely worth the monthly subscription fee.
. super easy to use on my galaxy 4 able to invoice clients as i am departing the work site. leads to quicker payments.
using for almost 30 yrs and about to quit. very sad that they charge for every issue now, to pay a bill, to use an invoice, even to do a credit for a vendor. it's going to be less expensive to hire a book keeper!
. very easy and convenient!
great software. i worked with quickbooks over 5 year and i say 90% of the time works great thats. good for accounting software
sync does not work. since the april 25th update bank sync is not working. i called tech support and they say they are working on it. no news yet after one week.
. this is a f_____ing scam i have been trying to cancel this confusing app for months i need some help
. great app!
. great app so far
. good software
. the app is fantastic everything works well little exhausting to set accounts and banking but once everything is done and working it's very efficient and my customers can get their invoices very quickly plus in my electrical construction business.
crashes with ios 13. just a heads up. when you try to take a picture of a receipt to upload to the account, the app freezes up and you can‚Äôt continue on. restarting the app doesn‚Äôt work either.
. simple operation and easy to prepare work
. best business app
great app. makes life easy. one addition will make it perfect. add journal entry to the app.
. its a good app.
. your log in process is pathetic. its always asking me to verify and that process takes over an hour most of the time as it keeps resetting to the main log in screen. if you can't fix this i'll cancel my subscription
must have for small business. i love the app is easy to use and easy to monitor business finances
one of the best accounting software.. very good and well made accounting software. very easy and friendly to use. the things i especially like about this application is that i can book an expense on the go through the mobile app and i can access this accounting software from anywhere and on any device!!
so good. best account software available
new update horrible. it's always been glitch but since the new update i can't add products to the estimate and customer service is clue less in how to resolve the issue.
great tool for simple bookkeeping. my business is only income and expenses and cash basis, no inventory, so this tool is great and easy. i do all my book keeping from my phone.
good so far. it seems good so far, will update later when i actually have time to form an opinion. it keeps begging for a review so here..
great app. really like this app but switching from iphone to an android device i miss the expense option in the app. for the iphone you could input an expense on the app with the android you can not. i would like to see that added for the android app.
. app keeps closing right after opening even after uninstalling and then installing and also clearing app cache and data.
doesn't work. app isn't working with lg g5 with android.6.0.1. won't let me login.
amazing!. so useful for keeping our businesses books current!
. this app is easy to use and convenient
multiple companies. love the app when it's working properly. doesn't switch between companies well, it'll show customers for my other company under the wrong account and makes it impossible to actually work from. i'm sure if you just have one business account it works fine.
not bad needs a little work. online is getting better with each update. still needs more options with mobile and ipad. one for sure needs to have bank account option on payment received
. love this app for our business. we use it for billing and taxes and it's nice how its all online.
. why are you advertising this app when you're not servicing in india.
outstanding. fix individual entry format for android for a 5 star rating.
revolutionized my business. i don't know how i would be able to run my business without the quickbooks program now that i've had it for several years. i'm just starting to take advantage of the mobile capabilities of the program and it's great!
great program. it handles almost everything a small business needs. best part is, it's very user friendly.
again. after running smoothly for couple months, again a problem! now whenever i try to work from customers tab, it crashes....
. piada! al√©m de n√£o sair da tela de cadastro inicial, a galera s√≥ fala em problemas relacionados a pagamento nao devolvido e mal funcionamento. o apelo √© extraordin√°rio e carente aqui no playstore, mas esse aqui t√° ferrado!
would like more features. there are some features missing from the mobile version that i prefer  like seeing my bank account register even though i‚Äôm connected online; transferring info to turbotax; and automatically crediting extra payments on an account to the next invoice. unfortunately, i cannot transfer to another version except by hand, so i‚Äôm staying with this version.
awesome app!. great software, well written and updated regularly, moves seamlessly between phone ipad and desktop
". creo est√° app buena administraci√≥n de empresas x ese motivo desidi "" instalarla y google como responsable de negocios, se entienda, bien con esta empresa y tiene juegos de loter√≠a de los casinos, tambi√©n, para yo jugar en ratitos,"
. excellent app
pointless. useless app. can‚Äôt even see any supplier invoices etc. what is the point of having the app if you can‚Äôt work fully on the go!?
not that great. was pretty good before the last update. new update is terrible, would be happy to speak with the suits upstairs. unable to fix this. makes it very frustrating. please fix this, straight away.
very good for any kind of business!. quickbooks is great app for managing the everyday finances. it's very fast to send invoices, with this app all income and expenses are simple and quick.
great tool for those on the go!. while there is a lot of functionality missing that would make this app even more convenient, what it does offer is a tremendous help while on the go. from creating invoices to recording expenses to seeing your p&l and balance sheet, this app is a great tool and extremely easy to use!
easy to use. i love my quickbooks app. this is the first year my taxes will be done on time because i didn't have to spend hours at desk!
should of bought it ages ago. such an easy to use app and system, back up support were quick precise and friendly. well done quick books
all that you need at the same app. great app, easy to navigate
great flow. easy to use. quick reference. great app!
. subscribed at the top tier quickbooks subscription, but i cannot check my inventory on the mobile app. i cannot express how sad i am, that should the first feature to ever be implemented but its just not there.
. tenue de livre simple et pratique!
excellent. you can do so much with just this app  absolute game changer. love it.
the software has been a nightmare recently using iphone and ipad keeps saying i haven't paid. i've written to emails and had absolutely no response to either no refunds either because i can't get the software to work unless i'm in mice studios on my laptop which is being fixed currently i won't be with me for the next four weeks so how i'm supposed to do any invoicing i have no idea this is absolutely ridiculous use sage...
okay. i'm new to doing my own bookkeeping and find this product clunky and not very easy to use. issues with importing transactions and program changing dates and the order compared to the bank. it's not very easy to see what account transfers are moving tofrom. it's hard to distinguish credits for debits. poor customer service. no good summary graphs. slow to attach receipts. multiple clicks to do basic things. cuts off file names if there too long.
my business has transformed.. i have received multiple compliments from my customers regarding my new invoices and estimates.
. there's no option to cancel my subscription
qb intuit online app. fantastic program highly recommend üëçüòÄ
. great app for small business.
ridiculous. very nice overall, with an incredibly aggravating poison pill. some genius (?) decided to eliminate text input on dropdown lists (eg payee), guaranteeing long and annoying scrolls for long lists. renders a potential convenience quite useless?
comptroller. qb exceeds my expectations of an accounting software programme . the programme was initially suggested by a major accounting firm.
i love quickbooks online. i love quickbooks online & my accountant does also. this app is really good for doing your expenses on but as far as invoicing i still do it on the computer. it's very handy for a small business. the fact you can enter an expense, take a picture of the receipt & go on your merry way. i'm sold.
lee. alot better and easier to use than some book keeping companies out there.
. perfect! never have an issue & do not plan ever going to a different kind of software.
great. efficient. user friendly.. really enjoying having this app option for my business. absolutely loving quickbooks intuit online!! really like it can upload photos of receipts. my only suggestion would be to allow photos to be upload to an itemized bill. thank you.
working fine but add more features. also revise ui designs in app.
. it stop tracking my miles 3 days ago and now it's useless to me. don't waste your money.
beware price increases.. i love the functionality, but i've had two price increases since becoming a subscriber to the online service. the entire point of a subscription model is so that the company has a sustained income in order to continue developing and my costs stay fixed every month. this isn't acceptable so i'll be looking for other solutions soon.
. amazing app for business
landscape company. i like this app as it helps me stay on top of the billing before i leave the site. but the client care and billing is horrible customer care is the worst in north america. stay far away from this company. they bill you when they are not suppose to.
loving the app. glad i discover the quickbooks app. have just started using quickbooks and must say i'm impressed and now that i have the app its just taken managing my small business to a whole new level. hats off to the developers and all involved.
. i wrote you before, i have uninstalled app.. i have a android.. app wont open says.. experiencing techinical difficulties temporarily unavailable..
excellent app. keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
love this app. the app links straight to your computer so you can send quotes, invoices etc on the move. this is a great small business tool at a great price.
paypal integration very poor. quickbooks say it integrates with paypal and automatically downloads transactions. well, it does partly, but doesn't download into expenses the transaction fees with paypal here, meaning you have to do it manually. it will do it for an online purchase to the same account so why it doesn't work properly is a complete mystery and one support do not help with.
doesn‚Äôt work with ios 13. keeps knocking me out.
great app. the best invoice maker i ever had! great services
like the app. just hope it would be easier to use need better access to my custumers invoice and estimates
qb app !!!. love the app ! now with the new update i can log in with touch id :))) how fan, and saving much time.
they discontinued this app. do not download this. they stopped the link so it no longer works. too bad because i was using this to run my business and now i'm screwed. i have to find another app quick to do my invoices with. i like razorsync for scheduling but i am not thrilled with their estimating and invoicing. if intuit had kept this up and just made some improvements it would be great!
. great app for small businesses easy to record all ur reciepts
worst customer service. i love the idea of the app but it‚Äôs too confusing i don‚Äôt get a lot of the options and customer service i barely understood anything was no help at all. i just simply needed the app to track incomeexpense and personal pay.
quickbooks mobile. can‚Äôt print mobile.... on a mobile app. still writing invoices and entering them later 2x the work and the price keeps going up.
terrible product and now doesn't even connect. previous reviews are on the money, this app is terribly crippled on ipad and mobile. to make it worse some days, like today i can't even connect to do these limited tasks. intuit please wake up before you get rolled over like blackberry!!!
. love this app
roofing business. i have been using quickbooks for almost a year for my husband roofing business and i love it! why we are out looking at jobs i can do an invoice on my phone and email it right away to the customer! and i can go home and work from laptop as well! i recommend quickbooks for book keeping for business!
loads of bugs since updating to ios 13. broken links. can‚Äôt call up customer information. dashboard only shows banking information. invoices and estimates haven‚Äôt saved when generated on mobile device.
slow to respond from time to time .. the app is sometimes slow to respond.
emailing invoices. this is an excellent app for tracking income and expenses. however, whenever i try to email invoices, it gives an error message that it is 'unable to send message'. will give five stars if this issue is worked out.
broken app. unusable. app fails to load company data. waited an hour on the phone and never got help. killing my ability to invoice customers while mobile, which is the only reason i chose the online version that i pay for every month! intuit is not intuitive, they're only into your money. zero support. zero answers. zero. the worst.
. wow isn't enough ... 100000 problems 1 sollution.. ÿ®ÿ™ŸàŸÅŸäŸÇ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿ≥ÿ®ÿ≠ÿßŸÜŸá Ÿàÿ™ÿπÿßŸÑŸâ ... Ÿà ÿ®ÿ±ÿ≠ŸÖÿ™Ÿá Ÿà ÿ®ŸÅÿ∂ŸÑŸá ... ŸàÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ŸÑŸÑŸá ÿ±ÿ® ÿßŸÑÿπÿßŸÑŸÖŸäŸÜ .. ÿßŸÑÿÆŸäÿ± ŸÉŸÑ ŸÖŸÜ ÿπŸÜÿØ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿ≥ÿ®ÿ≠ÿßŸÜŸá Ÿà ÿ™ÿπÿßŸÑŸâ ...
works smoothly. can't tell you how much time i've saved tagging receipts in this app. simple and useful.
useless!. who is writing these positive reviews? this app is completely useless. it has none of the functionality of qb online, and neither does the mobile version accessible from a browser. with all of the money we spend monthly on qb products, the lack of useable features on mobile devices is extremely disappointing. can't even get a register balance? ridiculous!
. highly recommend this app for every company
please update to support iphone x. please update to support iphone x
. very close to cancelling my subscription as app doesn't work. after adding 45 receipts i get an error message that my request cannot be added and i should call customer support. have tried reinstalling clearing cache signing out and nothing works permanently very frustrated
very nice!!. have been using this app and computer software for 2 years now. very easy to use, have had no errors or screw ups with the app. it's great to link bank accounts to app for instant payments from invoiced. it's helped me with my business and accounting dramatically
meh. so slow loading new pages invoice templates are ugly hard to view invoice view doesn‚Äôt quite seem ‚Äúgoogle‚Äù more like a government website that got a makeover
"cheap. it's one of those slickly apps that pops up in your search result which is filtered to show only free apps. after you waste your time downloading and signing up, it tells you to start your free ""trial""."
. won't let me add bank accounts. app is useless.
. great app!
simple to use. allows me to manage the books of my business anywhere anytime and i a can create an invoice directly from my phone which is very convenient.
". 6.10.19  i hate it. you can't do ""billable"" expenses from the app. you cant edit invoices that have been sent. terrible. i hate it. 8.12.19  still hate it. noone has ""investigated""my situation. üëéüëé"
. problem opening app worked yesterday, and won't let me open app today
convenient mobile dashboard. very convenient mobile dashboard allows quick status of all my invoices.
employee. love quickbooks but really want to incorporate it into my service vehicles please make a employee version
i can no longer log in. everytime i enter user name and password and press enterlogin, the password field goes blank and i get a message saying login failed.
. all selfemploy business need a quickbook to hepl delivered business closure with your busines transaction .
great. efficient. user friendly.. really enjoying having this app option for my business. absolutely loving quickbooks intuit online!! really like it can upload photos of receipts. my only suggestion would be to allow photos to be upload to an itemized bill. thank you.
great app. great app for someone on the go. chris
touch id and pin not working. i down loaded the update; the update was suppose to help improve touch id and the pin. however, now bone of them work and i have to sign in every time. i tried it on my iphone and ipad neither work. disappointing
simple and easy. i find the app and the computer program simple and easy to navigate. i operate my small business using quickbooks and i am yet to have an issue.
"confusing and cluttered app. i love that nearly all of the features in the desktop app are here in the mobile app. however the interface, especially the home page, is confusing and cluttered. ""company activity"" is a bit useless as the default page. show me the charts of paidunpaid invoices. i think the developers are tasked with including every single feature and that clouds their design judgement. it's not an easy ask but let's make this app more mobile friendly."
good program. been using this software for about 6 months now and find it very useful as a sole trader it works for me i can pick up my phone and write an invoice straight away.
making our life much easier. this has made running 2 small companies so much easier. the product was recommended by our accountant and has made our accounting faster, simpler and hassle free. highly recommended.
still needs some changes. multiple addresses for a company is still a drama as it changes all pervious invoices and quotes. plus now on the ipad version it says i can't access until subscription is paid but it is.. works on computer but can't use my ipad. annoying!!!
horrible app. you can‚Äôt add time activity. this has to be the stupidest design i‚Äôve ever seen. you‚Äôre in the field and the most common use would be to add billable time. i‚Äôm about to switch to another provided if they don‚Äôt get their act together.
". you broke the app!!! can't attach pdfs to invoices anymore!!! it litteraly worked yesterday, and today a ""new"" interface. make a deal with adobe and fix it now!!! update no your solution doesn't help. i already new i could do this on the desktop version. app is still broken and your proposed solution is just as useless as you have rendered your app. fix it"
do not waste your time on this free version. this is a very limited app. do not try it! app is limited and they just try to up sell the full version. support friendly but can not support a mobile version on an ipad . this product only good for desk top computer. would not recommend to anyone. beware. check out other reviews i simply ignored the negative reviews now i am writing one.
. the wish access to my qb account has been great to keep a pulse on the business as well as getting cash expenses in before i forget about them.
. great now i can do alot of my office work while in the field. this app lets me have more time making money instead of sitting at home on computer.
great app!. our company switched from quickbooks desktop to the online version which came with the option to download the app. we now use the app more than online. we handle estimates, invoices, payments, banking and more directly in the app and on the go. the app has a simple and clean look making it easy to navigate. to date we haven't had any issues with it. we are excited to finally be able to get things done in less time!
update. it takes a few days to update itself with my online account...
lots of errors.. there are a lot of bugs with qbo, and my accountants have noted errors in the reports. apparently qb is aware but haven't resolved the issues. we have also had numerous glitches in the program  including not being able to log into our account (only being able to log into my accountant's page). this issue has been ongoing for over 18 months without resolution. overall qbo has great potential if it only worked properly.
does not work. vendors don't display but when you try to add the vendor you can't find it tells you that the vendor already exist. even if account #'s are turned of ipad version still shows them. not worth the frustration!!!!!!!!!!!!
great program for what is asked of it.. great program (i use desktop app on my macbook pro). but constant ‚Äúimprovements ‚Äú make it hard to find menus you once had. needs a one click solution to print all open invoices at once. biggest complaint is i get thrown off a few times a week. it‚Äôs a quick reload, and i have not lost any data, but annoying.
very limited... quickbooks is one of the best accounting tools out there... however this app is very limited. ipad is a very powerful device. but this app doesn't take advantage of that. things like: * auto save invoices to the files app * option to choose payment type * when you paste an email from the email apps, it doesn't recognize those emails.. * option to add company stamp and seal to the invoices
quickbooks on the go!!!!. i love the program and app. i find that it's easier through the app since i can just take the photo right from my phone. i recommend this for anyone!!!!
. extremely user friendly, customers love the on the spot invoices and ability to sign for and pay for work right on the spot!
unable to sign in.... same issue many users are having with the latest update, i can no longer sign into my account with the app.
"missing a couple things. would be even better if the mobile app allowed you to enter the ""ship time"" and ""ship date"" and if the ""reports"" could be viewed on the app could be more full service"
can't even create an account. american centred software. won't even accept uk mobile number when trying to sign up!! fail!
. this app is fantastic and easy to use
app needs major work. the app is useless, i have to pull out my laptop or wait till i get to my home or office. i would love to use my ipad pro, that i carry everywhere but the app is literally useless!!! please fix asap
. i'm a small business owner and for me finding this app has been a blessing. this app really helps me manage my expenses as well as keep track of my inventory, employee payroll can be done as well etc. just really easy to use and having the profit and loss tracker is just awesome. so far i'm loving the free trial, definitely will subscribe once trail is over.
. love the ease of the software
my company has grown with quickbooks. i logged in my first invoice in quickbooks the summer of 2001 when i started my first business. over the years, i have not used any other software other than.
. app is crashing on login. i cannot access my business now.
. awesome company! app works great!
steve. as a desktop user this was a big disappointment. if you are trying to push people onto the online version it should work the same as the desktop. cost me time and money switching back to desktop version they messed up my data took me 8 hrs of manual data entry to correct.
. can't create an account. fails every time. can't update due to server failure. no support available either.
super & excellent apps. very user friendly application . i would recommend this software to other people
. it used to be a great app. but they even do not allow me to login anymore.... i did change the password so many times and did uninstall and install the app. now, i need to go back to my old iphone or lapy for my bookkeeping:(
a good idea but not very useful yet. there is not access to the important online reports. there is no access to fx transactions or accounts in a foreign currency. i live overseas and bill my clients in us dollars and as such have no access to client information or us dollars sales and accounts. if the app mirrored the online program it would be great but it doesnt!!
still no touch id. i used to think this was a great app, but now with these last 2 updates, i have to constantly uninstall the app and still no touch id. why when something works fine can you not just let it be.
phone app fail. what ever opinion you have of qbo ... the phone app fails. it will not let you see the estimates and invoices for a customer. they exist, in your system but they do not show up in the app. everything else.... any other feature discussion... it's all irrelevant. if you can't view basic customer info, the app fails.
. the app offers no simple means to cancel your account should you wish to do so. their help desk also seems eager to push you off on to other, equally unhelpful venues. they also informed me that once i manage to cancel my account (if even possible) they will continue to hold on to my personal information, defeating the point of cancelling an account.
good. so far so good. wish more things were accessible on the app.
great app for qb online. when i need an invoice sent out and i'm away from my pc, qb solved the inconvenience with this app. one thing i can't find is how to change the figure slide login.
. use to like this app a lot but now it's been very glitchy and can't even enter anything into quickbooks.
. love it! super easy to learn and use
phone number. i like the app. i can use it for my business plan. but when im entering my phone number to create my account, it says invalid. please fix. country: philippines
. this app is honestly magnificent. it helps me balance my checkbook. helps me track expenses and send invoices. it's honestly a must.
makes life easier!. helps me keep record of everything from invoices, payments customers and expenses.
touch id fail. please stop making us enter a password everyday. every other app that uses touch id doesn't have this issue. thumbs down qb üëéüèº
very nice to use. great app
signature issues. the app crashes every time i get a signature or it doesn't save the signature. please resolve this issue. it has now been a week and this is still an issue.
. perfect for anyone in business. easy to learn and navigate. my clients love the fact i can give them a written proposal or invoice on the spot.
great mobile app but.... great mobile app, very convenient. however, i could really use a way to do bank deposits on the mobile app.
awful. iphone app pretty much unusable in the real world. always wants to be signed in each time you open it, touch id feature doesn't work. today it's complaining the app needs to be updated before i use it, it then directs me to the app store where it shows i already have the latest version!
quickbooks. i like that everything is so easy to see and that i can reconcile for a phone app it's great!!
app stopped loading after ios update. please fix
. easy to use with a clear overview of your business expenses
. doesn't work for the last few months on any of my devices. called many times support and they said they are aware of the problem and they are working on it. this is insane!!! i'm paying every month to get the online version and it doesn't even let me sign in. it shouldn't take month to fix such a problem.
awwwwwwsomw. great app totally get it
. great app
so much better. intuit have certainly listened to there customers and have massively improved the app with some recent updates. so much better and easier to use than before. well done intuit finally glad a huge company has finally listened to its customers
inventory. i would like to see quantity of my inventory on the app. please make this happen.
. makes my job easier.
. very handy for a lanscaper on the go. now i can email invoices as soon as we are finished right from my smartphone, wether i'm standing next to the customer or in the truck. makes my life easier
great features but very unstable and poor support. i‚Äôm an accountant that works with xero, qb and myob. quickbooks online offers probably the best combination of xero and myob‚Äôs best features but is let down hugely by the app‚Äôs instability (very slow and regularly crashes) and their support, whilst very friendly, is poor in quality and suffers from obvious lack of proper systems and workflow. we‚Äôre holding off recommending qb to clients for these two reasons. they aren‚Äôt quite deal breakers but close.
"complete shit. developers can't seem to get it right.. going from version to version will cause problems logging in. might as well not offer as a mobile app, ""on the go"" my ass. i was told ""we're working on"" (for the past 6 times i inquired) then the last time ""too bad, use the web site for now""."
excellent app and service.. great product.
david hall. great app , excellent for small business
they screwed up logging in with pin. i used to have to type my full password in only every few days. now it's several times a day. why even have the option to use a pin if it only works a couple times. i contacted them through the app but got no response.
outstanding app!. owning a small business has enough headaches as it is. with quickbooks, estimating and invoicing projects and services couldn't be easier! everything is streamline! here's a look inside my day to day as a landscaper using quickbooks: initial client meeting> estimate delivered before i leave the property.. bam! they call back that night or the next day and we have the job. after we finish the project, turn that estimate into an invoice on site.. bam! paid! $$ in the bank!
excellent. does what it says on the tin.. excellent app. works brilliantly on the ipad, sometimes find it a little sluggish on the iphone but i put that down to the poor wifi we sometimes have and bad signal from phone operator. anyways it's so easy to use and i can produce an invoice there and then and email to the client instantly. don't know why i took so long to move from desktop to quickbooks online.
don't do latest update. was working great until latest update. now i cannot create any invoices.
time tracking missing from app. i bill services by the hour and pay extra for the version of quickbooks that supports time tracking. was very disappointed to see this feature completely missing from the app. it‚Äôs such an obvious thing to have on the go. now i need to have a totally separate system to track time...
convenient app for my accounting on the go. love the user friendly interface and convenience of upkeeping my accounts anytime anywhere
fairly good. not too bad, does most of the things you can do with your browser on pc but i would like to see the ability to update your bank account in the app
. qb online good, but feels really limited in comparison to the webapp in terms of available functions and data sync is slow, even over 4g lte. more of a qb issue. great platform, but could improve.
has some üêú. i really like qbs. sometimes i cannot send invoices or edit. a message pops up saying that ‚Äòtry again later‚Äô. i would like to use my own design for my invoices instead of the very simple format i can only use in their system.
best business app. this is very helpful in keeping accounts excellent app
can't tap anything when looking at an individual transaction. banking > new transactions > view transaction let's you see what quickbooks added but doesn't let you edit anything.
. great app. i enjoy it. helps me with my small business
. difficult to use. much different than the desktop version. i only use it if i am desperate. cant even find existing transactions or quotes .
. wouldn't be able to run my company with put this service. just done know why i lost my deal on my monthly payment. it was supposed to be $7.99 a month.
love it. i love the quickbooks program because all of my employees can log into the program from different locations at the same time.
improved quickbooks. it has many features than can help small businesses. the app can help you to organize, make use of spare time to do work.
. this just turned into a must have app
receipts no longer a 1 person job. if you purchase it, you expense it directly to qb! saves me, the accountant, hours. don't worry i can still reconcile to our bank and credit cards plus double check entries. never been so easy. only disadvantaged is i use a separate app to scan receipts versus a picture. scan is much more document friendly. maybe next release?!?!
sucks. half ass 30 day trial. sucks. put ads in the app and make it free. morons
band download not working. can't download bank transactions for months now.
bad update. used to work good until last update now when i open the app is says downloading company data, gets stuck there for ages. if it finally loads, there are no customer invoices, just payments. tried deleting the app and reinstalling but does the same thing. the pc app works fine and my employees have samsung phones and they haven't complained of any issues may just be an iphone app problem.
crashes after i hit ‚Äúinvoices‚Äù. love the app when it works please let me know what the fix is
. good app
sales tax calculation is wrong. when creating an invoice, the app does not honor customer's sales tax setting. it applies tax even on customers with tax turned off. please fix asap!!!!
keeps crashing. i can't do anything with the app. every time i try to open it, it closes out about 5 seconds later. worked great until the last update.
bo. very happy with qbo
fonts too big and can‚Äôt be read anymore. since the latest update, fonts are too large and you can‚Äôt read the amounts of your invoices anymore. sent them many screenshot examples, still can‚Äôt use the app anymore. also, sometimes you can‚Äôt even ‚Äúaccept‚Äù an invoice on the app as well. useless for me to use now. what a shame, because i used it daily. iphone 11 pro with latest ios v13.2.2
easy to use. really like the app because i can keep up with accounting on the go for my business.
. great app, must have for business owners and organized individuals!
not compatible with my lg g4 phone. i bought new lg g4 and installed the app on it, once i try to sign in the app crashes , i sent email to customer service and it has been three months since then, they keep saying we are trying to solve the issue, worst customer service ever.
it is very easy to use. the app may not have the power or flexibility of the web client, or pc installed application, but it works well and is very easy to use.
pedro valdes,ea. very good for accountant, and clients. less time for both.
great app. easy to use app. very user friendly. a must have for small business owner
absolutely the best. very easy to use. tried different apps but none of them gave me results. i absolutely recommend it!
great. for a small business owner quick books and the app have really improved my ability to effectively handle alot of my back end paperwork more easily.
i is a app every body need .. back ground check one of my friend die yesterday ok lady's meet men online.
. not functioning as many have stated to be having the same issue unable to view customers invoices ect on the home screen obviously a common major issue need a fixing
. i am able to organize my expenses.
awesome app. simple, clean. just need the banking feed for the android in canada please!
. great accounr app
. in usable black screen comes for a long long time in start up and during usable on android. the worst party is that issue has been there since ages. it's like qbo is not interested in developing this app
qbo online (android). overall an effective and efficient application; and the price was a little cheaper through google play then through intuit online. the only function i wish was there is the mileage tracking, as it is in the qb self employed.
easy & convenient. love how easy it is to navigate the menu and do my business away from the computer.
worst application on the planet. i think quickbooks itself as a company intuit. needs to reevaluate their customer service as well as their applications. nothing from them ever seems to work properly nor will you ever get anybody on the phone who knows how to use the software. i would strongly recommend another piece of software don't waste your time with this crap
super app. very satisfy with demo. app looks and works super but expensive! :(
well made basic accounting. quickbooks online has been extremely useful. i have a small contracting business, and i can record an expense in seconds, photo the receipt, create an invoice or estimate, and email these to customers. syncs instantly and automatically across multiple devices, so it's on my phone, tablet and online. the cost is tiny, and it takes care of itself  no more shoebox!
best business app. quickbooks has definitely made running my business much more efficient and has made it easier to close on deals. the estimate tool makes it easy to send professional looking estimates to clients, and with a click, those estimates turn into invoices. you can receive payments through quickbooks as well. add the payroll service and you can run the whole business yourself. i would definitely recommend this to any new business start up.
. clunky, ugly app with barely any features. there's no way to refresh your banking data within the app, though navigation and ux is so awful i maybe just can't find it. no consistent design standard throughout with multiple different menu types, navigation styles, presentation. almost no graphics, just pages of text. invoicing, expenses and tracking are all so horrible i'm forced to use the (also underwhelming) browser version. how did this pass quality control?
great app...! (sabre rx). great app, really works well now that the new syc app with square has been released.
great. great app
current update just crashes. ios10 with the new update on ipad don't work. app opens then immediately closes.
game changer. changed the way i handle my business transactions. from a simple to complex my invoices and estimates are presentable, traceable and accounted for. my reports help me secure loans in a flash. and my accountant loves me.
ipad. does not work with ipad pro screen that well
update is horrible!. i've been using qb online app for a long time. and it seem like the app finally had started to improve and now this latest update has caused some great frustration. i do not recommend updating totally get these glitches resolved.
easy to use. i love what i do. the finance side, not so much. quickbooks helps make that task a little easier and more manageable. now i‚Äôm learning about how different applications can tie into quickbooks and make my life even easier. there is a bit of a learning curve for those that are not as savvy into this area, but they are quick to help and point you in the right direction.
excellent mix of features, convenience, affordability. provides an excellent combination of easy to use features and convenience for use on mobile devices. software and features are updated regularly. one of the best solutions out there. the only reason i've withheld one star is i'd like to see more affordable packages
great app. i don't have any problems with the app, seamless integration with the desktop.
no way to select india as a country. hello i am using iphone xs .. i downloaded ur app .. i am not able to select india as the country.. what seems to be the problem ?
app is useless. receipts and notes entered in the app do not show in the register online without additional steps. it doesn‚Äôt even show there is an attachment even though i selected show attachments in settings. so what‚Äôs the point. absolutely ridiculous in this day and age.
good start, needs more. nice gui, great start to all potentialy great tool for business. the app needs more options than just customer billing. thats half of a business. i want to be able to log expenses like fuel, tool rentals, etc via the mobile app as i make those purchases.
don't believe the hype. this app is practically worthless. all important actions require you to be on the website. i need to be able to invoice, payroll, and do taxes from the app as i am hardly with my computer.
. very easy to use on any device at any time. customer support is on it quickly when you contact them.
". the app will not sync to my quickbooks data. an error message appears. i am able to access my data online but not on the app. after 2 hrs on the phone with ""quickbooks"" i am left with ""we don't know"" and no solution in sight. i am a contractor and i use my phone or tablet to invoice etc. now i have all my accounting on quickbooks and can't use my phone or tablet to work it."
. would like to be able to send invoices
good deal. i appreciate this app. it helps me keep an eye on my business so i'm not always sitting in front of my laptop.
great app. this app is great and easy to use
ipad app. please update your app to be more like the desktop version...i can not track inventory received through the ipad app i purchased and ipad pro hoping to do away with my laptop and so far its been seamless, except for this app not being able to track inventory received. i hope your developers can figure this out before my 8 year old laptop crashes! thanks
please add signatures options estimates!!!. i love this app but it could offer customer signatures agreeing to terms on invoiceestimates features. for example if i send an estimate via email, customers can reply back with a signed estimate allowing me on the other end to place order since i now have their consent. it will save me a trip on having drive out to their location for a signature. please add this feature!!! pretty pleaseeeee.
problem after problem lately. first my bank feeds got messed up after the feed had to be updated recently. this wasted a lot of time. now, the app is telling me my account is restricted because they didn‚Äôt receive a payment  but i have an email from quickbooks billing confirming that they received a payment. this is not great for a company that is looking after my business.
". often doesn't work. customer service tells me not to use the app, to access account from web browser. the numbers you get there may be undependable. don't trust it. the browser doesn't work with the phone. there only reason for quickbooks online is access while away from the computer. i often get the message,""check back in a few hours"". isn't that great when standing in front of a customer trying to write an invoice."
. great great app
love it on the go!. qbo definitely makes life easier when i'm on site with my clients!!
. making my life so much easier!
simply amazing for the newbie!!. as a sole trader, i am so impressed at how simple this product is to use!! it has saved my bacon on a number of occasions!! collating reports at an instant!! not to mention looking professional to my clients every time i send an invoice !! highly recommend this to anyone wanting to commence on the journey of being your own boss!! what a game changer indeed!
superb. the app on the iphone is great. works perfectly and great for quick invoicing. the ipad app is even better as provides much more in depth information. even better both apps work seamlessly with each other. don't know what i would do without this app.
. doesn't work with asus android 7.0. i received a reply from quickbooks about this review but i never received a reply from the phone call that i did. they said that they will contact me in 48 hours, this was more than a week ago. i send an email today to the email that they gave me today, let see how long they will reply me with some kind of solution. i will keep this post actualized.
keeps on crashing. i have uninstalled and reinstalled and it still isn't working. keeps on stopping after i enter my username and password. please help.
. it's great being able to update invoices on site with customers right there to make sure they understand charges and such!
. helpful and useful
easy to use and great features. i moved to quickbooks after trying xero, and find it at least as good for my needs and much better value. good foreign currency support, which is important for me.
ios13. can you fix the app?
quick books. so easy and simple. just the basics to fit the mobile phone
great app.. will help me tract expenses!!
. quickbooks lover for years so app is right for me
. the app won't let me sign in. i've even reset the password and uninstalled the app and tried again, but i keep getting password error.
easy to use. keeps me on top of my expenses every day. should have started using it months ago!
the app have few bugs & the customer support sounds like they not familiar with their products. when you create a new customer and saving it and then you need to change some information in the contact it still shows the previous info contacted customer support few times and they are useless
help. there doesn't seem to be a way to tie in purchases on to a invoice to charge specific customers. when you call in for help with the app, customer service does not have access to see what you're looking at.
last update ruined a great app. invoices won't save now and a customer file disappeared. please fix this app back to operational use soon!
horrible. what a joke. all i want to do is be able to go to my online account. every time i try to do that it pops up to install this app. i did. now when i go in nothing looks the same or works the same. you would think i would be able to go online without this horrible app. i would give it zero stars if i could.
excellent on the go apps  for small business. easy to navigate .
overdue but great! gorgeous!. this app is way, way overdue, but at least they got it right the first time around. no it doesn't do everything the website does, but nailed, adding buttons (functionality) is the easy part. it's definitely one of the best looking apps on my ipad.
fail update.. update never savessends invoices on either of my 2 devices
wow, did this app save our business. we are in florida and have had no power or internet for over one week. this app saved our real estate rental business. everything you can do on your desktop, you can do with your ipad, using this app. all customer data is stored on the cloud. this app is mandatory if you get hit by a disaster!
payroll done quickly!. love this app!
crashes ios 9 dont download. incompatible with ios9. can't run business properly now. please fix asap.
quickbooks online for the ipad. it works great!! anywhere at anytime. create your customers, create the estimate and then bill it out!! if your smart you will setup the direct payment to your bank account too!!
brilliant app. makes running a business a lot easier.
. i've used qb for 8 years. this app is the better and more seamless than the pc version. love the capability to invoice customers on the job, record payments and send a receipt in seconds.
awesome. i use it on my mobile, very efficient and fast in the field , for quick creation of invoices and quotations, on the spot so i never lose the opportunity to acquire a new jobs and customers
. the image quality of attaching receipts automatically downgrades and makes everything blurry. this renders the receipt image capture completely useless.
. how do i unsubscribe? i've been getting charged 5 bucks per month for a app that i deleted
excellent for the it service provider. as an it service provider, this app allows me to log my hours and mileage in the field. i can even email customer invoices immediately after services are performed. this is, of course, paired with quickbooks online plus, which allows you to log hours per customer. highly recommended!!
bad update. this update is very bad. activities don't come up anymore. have to navigate to long to find stuff... i don't need to see company details first. i need to see customer activities.... this is such a waste of time and very frustrating. now i have to search for a new program.
best app for small business. excellent
. can't upload receipt photos even when fully up to date
. cant send invoices via email like we used to. needs work. it really put us in a bad spot.
perfect app for any small business owner. as a qbo pro advisor my opinion may be somewhat biased but i can not brag enough about the software, customer support and resources offered by quickbooksintuit. qbo has allowed me to become a completely virtual bookkeeping firm, increasing my service area, customer satisfaction and turn around time. love love love them!!
. words cannot express how unfriendly this platform and interface is. both on app and desktop. nothing is plain and simple, switching back to invoice2go as i've been trying to create an estimate for over 6 hrs here and it takes me 5 mins on invoice2go
. app is crashing on login. i cannot access my business now.
. sweet app this is a sweet app for my small business
. great accounting app. would not be able to run my business without it.
. so far, it has been amazing at getting me out of a pinch when i don't have my computer handy. it was an amazing scope and i can do basically everything from my mobile. perfect. easy to get around and figure out. looking forward to exploring it more.
very helpful. make managing my bussines much easier. good app.
great updates and really user friendly. all works better than before and integrates brilliantly. makes understanding our financials a doddle!
. best app for doing business on the go! best customer service by far!
crashing. updated to ios 13 and now the app keeps crashing after face id, please get this sorted as i can‚Äôt run my business
quick books app. it works as good as my computers program! i can do the work i need to right from my phone!
"great app. great app. would be good to have a salesinvoice report that sorted by ""service date"". thanks :)"
i love it!. great app haven't seen anything better.
almost useless. if you are hoping for his app to at least somewhat mimic the full version you will be greatly dissapointed. basic functionality, like looking at a register or your accounts payable is missing. basically the only thing it is good for is looking at your accounts receivable.
the app is wonderful. quickbooks online itself is lacking in a few features that i would like, such as work orders and job costing. the app is well done though.
brilliant!. easy to use, matches payments received and ties them off with your invoices, easy to see profit and expenses for each month. well worth the monthly payment, my books have never been so easy to keep!
love this app!. this has solved my issue of remembering to create invoices after the service. so far i am loving this app :)
awful. iphone app pretty much unusable in the real world. always wants to be signed in each time you open it, touch id feature doesn't work. today it's complaining the app needs to be updated before i use it, it then directs me to the app store where it shows i already have the latest version!
good luck getting any tech support when you need it. not impressed! what a joke. don‚Äôt waste your time here.
. excellent app
still no touch id. i used to think this was a great app, but now with these last 2 updates, i have to constantly uninstall the app and still no touch id. why when something works fine can you not just let it be.
update asap. i‚Äôve been trying to use the app for a couple weeks now, and it keeps kicking me out. it‚Äôs very annoying!
my dependable business partner. over the years, as a small business owner, i have come to depend on quickbooks. initially that made me extremely nervous, but i have found that both the app and the online version have come to be dependable and it's very important partner in my business success. they have made the app even more intuitive. i recommend it!
impresessed. this app helped change my business!!!!!!!!!
app crashes in ios9. this app was working great before the recent update. app just crashes when i try to open. i use an ipad 3rd gen running the latest version of ios9. please fix!!
. fantastic software, user friendly and intuitive
add missing payroll  keypay. please add missing keypay. thanks
bad update. last update renders the app useless
quickbooks. great app!!
. made life easier as a small business owner!
excellent app. keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
. amazing app for mobile, i now use my phone to manage my complete project. great work quickbooks!!!
wow. great app
i'm underutilizing this app!!. this app is way more capable than the extant than i'm using it for! the best version of the app is on the ipad. the worst version is on my mbp.
. pathetic when it cimeys to app. never gives real time update. often can't refresh. a big no
. great app
. love that there is the mileage and receipt tracker now. i was disappointed when there was an entirely separate app and to see these added has made me very happy
zero stars. it really surprises me that a big company like intuitquickbooks couldn‚Äôt come up with something that worked. the app is almost completely useless. i installed it, tried to do some basic stuff on it and couldn‚Äôt so i deleted it. please intuit you have to have someone that can build you a better app!!
was awesome my nexus is not supported!. this is what i've been waiting for for years. 10 out of 5 stars if i could. but since my mobile decide is not supported.... hate to say it but worthless!
great program. i love quickbooks. i run payroll and create estimates, invoices and sales receipts. i am able to link all my accounts even my square account easily and seamlessly. the customer service representatives are competent and friendly.
. i installed it on my cellphone but wasn't installed because of insufficient storage. so what i did was to delete some apps on my phone. when i tried to install it again to the phone it won't work because the said phone now cannot be access because it's now not highlighted in this quickbook apps
great app!. our company switched from quickbooks desktop to the online version which came with the option to download the app. we now use the app more than online. we handle estimates, invoices, payments, banking and more directly in the app and on the go. the app has a simple and clean look making it easy to navigate. to date we haven't had any issues with it. we are excited to finally be able to get things done in less time!
. similar issues as gillian, dashboard blank, constant error messages on mobile. i also ended up accidentally reinstalling a slightly different version and was paying double!! i didn't realize there were two very similar apps!! i also uninstalled reinstalled and it didn't fix issue. i am currently trying to figure out how to recover all the expenses and photo's of receipts for the tax season.
2016 update is a headache. much improved after initial deterioration in poor updates. great software now. real time accounting is brilliant. l
needs a lot of work. app does not show up in recent app list. also it does not sync automatically.
. not able to login to app since one month now.
easy to use!. this app gives me the leverage i need to stay organized.
. after updating i cannot add a negative item in charges for discounts and stuff. why. will cancel sub soon if not fixed
good app. .
i love this better than their computer program!!!!. i love this app better than my computer program they have, it's easier to use & easier to track your expenses & sales. i recommend this to all my friends that basically run their business out of a vehicle saves on extra work when you get home.
. i have called customer support twice now. each time, i am greeted by an overly friendly person who barely speaks a word of english. either time was the agent able to even understand what i am asking for. they could offer no help, they would not transfer me to someone else. i am left all alone here trying to navigate a program and run a business. i have no idea how to get any help from these people. thank goodness for youtube!
. nice app. easy to build and send invoices.
great. great app, great software all around for my small business!
continuing issues. i've had the online and app for over a year and a half but the last 6 months it's a pain. double entries and trouble meshin with my bank for 2.5 months. ugh frustrating
wow!. really cool app! it's linked on all my device! i can make invoices on my phone and send it to my clients directly from email! cool stuff!
does not work after update. tech support recommended i get a android. claims apple is the problem.
inconsistent. ipad app is missing enter bills. doesn‚Äôt match screen layout of online.
. easy to navigate and perfect for small business owners!
really useful app.. but it would really be so useful if you could print sales receipts directly or even indirectly export as pdf to print on the go via a bluetooth receipt printer.
app. can not open quickbook app even after update.
not good for my use. i would like to have a setting to hide all account information so i can have employees out with ipads giving estimates or quotes. this is for personal business. good for that but forget trying to take pictures of receipts to write expenses.. takes longer than scanning them on my pc
quick easy access. does most needs, mindful it is not the full program.
where the banking. i want to accept transactions while i sit in bed, this app is far from useful without that capability, come on intuit, make the app complete. as is, a total let down!
paypal integration very poor. quickbooks say it integrates with paypal and automatically downloads transactions. well, it does partly, but doesn't download into expenses the transaction fees with paypal here, meaning you have to do it manually. it will do it for an online purchase to the same account so why it doesn't work properly is a complete mystery and one support do not help with.
for what do you need my number?. are you seriously? i have to make up an account with number? for what do you need this information? why u can‚Äôt make an app without stupid registration?
. restart the app error. uninstalled and reinstalled app. same error.
