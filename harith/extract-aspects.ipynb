Nothing about their program is intuitive- you are instead given loads of video tutorials and when that’s not enough you can call their Sales Department to get transferred to Customer Service (don’t try direct, it’s no use) who 9/10 times have thick foreign accents (which makes it even harder to understand the foreign accounting software) and if you’re lucky you get scripted answers with a side of sass. In my opinion, if your programming isn’t overwhelmingly user friendly you should at least have an overwhelmingly good customer service experience to give us all hope that we can, one day, figure it out. I am stuck with this program because my husband finds it easy enough to create and send an invoice, but unfortunately this leaves me to figure out the rest once a month.

First, I love that they’ve added the mileage feature. I had to have the self employed app as well just for the mileage tracking. However, it is not always accurate and doesn’t always auto track. It will also put a random address and if you try to change the address, it doesn’t correct the appropriate amount of miles. You have to delete and manually add it. Also, you have to put in the right amount of miles when manually adding; it doesn’t calculate from the starting and ending point. So, if you don’t know the mileage off the top of your head, you have to go to another map and find out the distance. \n",

You can print off everything else, just not that. Your sales tax system is a complete joke, after I complained that the system was ignoring the fact that some of my clients were tax exempt they fixed that by clearing all my tax exempt preferences. Dont even bother calling to support, you'll get some diptuit who dont know squat.   \n",
