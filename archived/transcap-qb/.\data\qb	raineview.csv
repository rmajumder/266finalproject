Shiny useless tool. This app looks awesome.  Very well thought out design and it appears that most of the functions are right at my fingertips.  Not so.  I have used it mostly for categorizing expenses.  I was trying to run a report, but nothing really made sense.  I went first to google to look for some tutorial videos, but it appears that most of the videos available online are only advertisements.  That is when I went to the help and support section in app.  In the section there is a FAQs area.  Perfect!  When I read the only article in this section I thought it must be some kind of joke.  It was an article on how to get to the FAQs section on the app.  It is like some perverted Groundhog Day scene, or like when you are reviewing a resume for a potential new hire and one of the sections is the filler text from the template they created the resume from.  I expect more from this company.  Fix this or simply remove it.
Latest app update. This update is terrible basically unusable please change it back ASAP
"App closes out while entering expenses. The majority of the time this app is wonderful. On a regular basis it will completely close out and I will lose the transaction I’m in the middle of. 
I’ve continually notified Intuit about this since the problem started in April of 2019. The consistent response is that they close out the ticket same day and never respond or research the issue. 
Today I’m told that they no longer have a department to help customers with the app. 
Now I’ve just recently renewed my annual subscription so I’m out that money because this product is unreliable."
Life saver. One my favorite apps to use while working. I’m on it like a social media page. Thanks quick books.
Great app for small business owners!. I have a Handyman business and this app made the paperwork side of the business easy!! I definitely recommend
"Good App but. It’s a good app but you should be able to mark invoices as paid and deposited via the app. 

My paid invoices are regularly, incorrectly shown as unpaid. I have to wait until I have time to go on my laptop and mark them as paid via the website"
Having issues with iPhone 11. After installing the app, and attempting to access it results in crashing.
Newest update doesn’t load dashboard. Dashboard and home button do nothing now. iPhone 11 Pro Max. Blank screen.
It's ok but don't get the most basic package. It's a vast improvement on another app I tried but the most basic pack makes me want more, upgrading now if I can so recommend you start with a higher grade package rather than the cheapest.
Terrible. This app has so many problems. It will freeze up and the only way to fix it is to delete he app and download it again. I wii ok old not recommend.
"Latest update removed every feature I used. DO NOT UPDATE! They really need to go back to the previous version of this app. Every time they make an update it seems to be useless tweaks in navigation, font size and anything else that adds no value or functionality. They really need to just work on bugs and leave the layout alone. 

With the latest update, they literally removed Every feature I used to use- dashboard widgets, P&L, balance sheet, bank account updating-all gone. It’s now absolutely useless."
Garbage. app stinks
"The worst customer service ever. Don’t waist your time. Trust my word. 

Update. I’m paying for 3 of the same app now and still can’t get any help."
"Functional but HUGE gaps. It works and some parts work very well.  But key basic functions like receipt matching do not work in the app.

Worse, I’ve found that there are situations where the app reports very different results than the online system.  It nearly resulted in us issuing incorrect 1099s because some sub contractor payments (such as those made in response to an invoice) disappeared completely from the app reports but are visible in the online version. Be VERY careful when using the app for any material reporting.

UPDATE:  Caitlyn, thanks but the hot links don’t work.  I’ve searched for those articles on our community site and found nothing.  I searched the topics and also found nothing helpful except clear statements that the app is synced with the site.  I sent in a ticket through normal channels two days ago and have heard nothing back."
Unable to Download. It keep saying you already own this app so it will download, but nothing happens
App doesn’t open. App doesn’t open on the new iPhone PRo

App is almost useless for me.. The only reason I upgraded to QuickBooks on line was so that I could do estimates and invoicing on site.  This app will allow me to do an estimate but will not let me do a partial invoice.  If I can’t do a partial invoice on the app it’s simply a waste of time for my small fencing business.
One of the worst decisions ever!. I decided to move forward with Quick books because of a friend recommending it to me. This has been one of the worst experiences ever. The customer service is terrible and the fact that quick books owes me money is even worst. I highly recommend that no one uses this service.
Mileage tracker not working.. So far QuickBooks support has not been able to get the mileage tracking feature to work on my phone.  IPhone6. Won’t manually of automatically track mileage and WB support has not resolved or explained why.  Partial functionality is not good enough!
Don’t use this with an IPad.. Bought this app and was unable to get it to work with an IPad. 4 hours on the phone with this company and still no success. They charged me and told me to get my money back through Apple. There is an open known problem being worked on their end but user’s beware. You won’t find out until you’ve paid.
"Not Just Businesses. I completely understand the business standpoint of this app. However there are regular people that would like to keep track of their receipts so that they can prepare their taxes much easier. 

When I was first introduced to this app via ad, it seemed as if it was a personal receipts app that allowed you to take a photo and save them. Not ONCE did the AD state it was intended for businesses. (The ad was on Instagram too. If I could go back and record it I would.) 

All in all the app is great for businesses but there should be a normal person standpoint. Meaning allowing people to track their receipts and then present them when taxes require so."
App notifications. App has issues which never get fixed. Always receive a bug upon opening, can’t connect to bank account until refreshed, deleted invoices won’t delete, I no longer receive notifications when customers make payments. Tried reinstalling, nothing works. How do I get this corrected?
Can’t Upload receipts. It’s incredibly ridiculous that you can’t upload receipts from anywhere but your photos app. What if you get emailed an invoice? Nope can’t upload it!
"Expense widget is not accurate. 1st let me say, I love the app even though the updates caught me by surprise. 

Now that I got that out of the way..

I have over $3200 in expenses so far this month. However when I open the app on my phone it says I only have $271 worth of expenses. 
I quickly grabbed my computer to double check and all the expenses displayed correctly. 

If I open the P&L in the noble app, the expenses display there correctly as well. The issue just seems to be with the stand-alone expense widget with the chart. 

Please fix that.  An option to remove it might be nice as well."
Bad update. I was having trouble with the mileage tracker and now with the update I can’t even check the settings.  Please fix this.  I am paying for this service to help run my business.  This isn’t a free game app.
Bad update. Befoe you used to record bank feed but no more! This update ruined the quickbooks app
Overall I recommend this app. I have a mobile veterinary service and use this for all of my billing while I'm on the road. It saves me time by allowing me to bill my clients on site at the time of service, and even process the credit card if they choose to pay that way. The only downside is that the cost per month Lewis going up.
"QB app is useless. Update 
Quickbooks refuses to recognize they have a problem with data being displayed incorrectly on the iPad app. It simply doesn’t show all of the current expenses like the online version does. I deleted the app and reinstalled same problem, so please quickbooks support listen to us and fix the problem.

I’ve been quickbooks user for a long time and discovered this app gives a totally different set of numbers than quickbooks online does. Expenses are different than real version so please beware, you can’t trust the numbers. Contacted support to no avail. I guess they don’t read the other reviews either.
Received a response from developer tried all their suggestions results the same. My mobile app doesn’t display an accurate picture of expenses. Many others have noted the same thing. The solution isn’t to delete and reinstall the app. That’s not a solution that’s a work around."
Doesn’t sync with Quickbooks online account. The app isn’t syncing with online account data. Was hoping to use the app for quick entry while on the go.
"Well thought out. Truly like the app now. I can import names from my iPhone and do many of the things I can do on a main computer.

I’d like to see them allow the entering of bills on the app. I’d use that all the time."
Very helpful.... There are some glitches with a couple of the features but for the most part, it’s exactly what I need. A great help for record keeping and invoicing my customers efficiently. There should be an option to select and send multiple invoices at once. I have multiple invoices per customer each week.
So easy to do books on the go!. I cannot say enough about the convenience of the app. I use it as soon as I get paid to log payments on it novices and enter sales receipts. This app and hiring a bookkeeper have been the best financial tools for the success of my business!
WOW!. Such an easy app to use as a new business owner and entrepreneur this really helps keep track of tax purposes and client sales!
n entendi nd. tenho 17 anos, nao entendi nd, sou burra ou esse app é ruim? talvez a primeira opção, mas de qq forma n gostei
Cost. Does this app cost anything, I am a small business, I haven’t made a profit yet, and don’t have much money, any help?
App slow to load and won’t save transactions. This is a new glitch since the update
Still buggy after all these years. QuickBooks finally fixed the problem of not being able to enter the date for bank deposits in the app, but now it’s gone from bad to worse. Now the bank deposit entry page won’t load. You get “this feature is not available at this time”. You have to close the program over and over again to finally get the bank deposit entry to load, sometimes even power cycling my phone. For $40 per month (minimum) you think they’d put a little more resources into their app, but they don’t have to since they’re a monopoly. Still the buggiest app on my phone.
QuickBooks lies again. This app does not track mileage as advertised
Does the job. Great app for fast results
"Latest update is garbage. Update: 1/6/20 still a garbage app even after multiple emails back and forth with quickbooks development team and now it’s been weeks since I heard from them the app still don’t work even after new updates 

 App has been great up until 3 weeks ago now it no longer works! Crashes every time I try to open the app."
"Heating/cooling guy. Trying to use the App. Nothing is happening, app opens and it’s blank this morning. Preformed an update too, still nothing.
Garbage app, sorry."
Superb Accounting App. The only mobile app I recommend if you are into real estate. It makes my job as a small real estate owner easier and smarter. Thanks Quickbooks for this amazing app. Great job on maintaining it. Cheers! 👍🥂
Overly complicated for sole prop. This app is useless for simple small business money in money out, it shouldn’t be this hard and definitely not worth the fight
...and now it doesn’t load. I depend on my QuickBooks app daily.  As of yesterday, it doesn’t load on my iPhone 7 running iOS 13.3.  Needs to be fixed please.
Stopped recognizing transactions. After the last update it stopped recognizing transactions. Even after the manual editing, still does not add them to my income. The same with the desktop app. The only difference is that the manual editing works on desktop.
Buggy. Try to submit feedback and can’t within the app. They removed the quantity column from invoices and their support is dismissive. This is a big company who price gouges and doesn’t really care about it’s customers.
Very handy app. So far like this app. I need not go to my computer for bookkeeping or to see what’s going on with accounting. Only I am not happy about general entries. Earlier, I was able to open and see general entries. Now app doesn’t open general entry. When I tried to open, it took me back to homescreen.
Updates that don’t install. and yet they won’t a install once again on iOS you would think IT people would get it
Very slow. This app is very very slow.. 10 minutes to load , another 10 minutes to load customer screen, and 15 minutes to apply 1 payment
Removed core functionality recently, price keeps increasing. I use the app heavily on the road to do things like match payments to open invoices so I have less work to do at my desk. A recent update removed the ability for me to drill into my bank account and match transactions to expenses or payments. This is very frustrating for me as a business owner, along with the steadily rising monthly fee, and Intuit may eventually drive me off their platform. Small business owners need not to be squeezed by companies such as Intuit, but instead have simple, quality software that allows us to grow and not take up valuable revenue.
"Crash flow. All the time. When will I stop banging my head against the wall using this app. I’ve tried everything to resolve the crashing issue on this app and still it crashes and still I go back only to have my work lost over and over again hoping that this time it wont crash mid invoice or estimate. Please let us know when Intuit can develop an app that works. And lower your credit card rates too, why don’t ya?!
Intuit has so many different ways and apps and products... please just do what you’re supposed to do well, like a functioning QuickBooks."
"QB app is useless. I’ve been quickbooks user for a long time and discovered this app gives a totally different set of numbers than quickbooks online does.

Not Useful at All. This app was written by someone who does not understand QuickBooks and its purpose. Get back to basics please if this is to be used by us.
Not accurate. Even after the most recent update the app still dose not accurately reflect my QBO account.  All information on vended and clients are not up to date.  This had been an ongoing issue for more than a year now. I keep hoping with every update this will be correct, but nothing yet.
No es Gratis. Al principio lo configuras todo pensando que la puedes usar gratis aunque luego hagas compras en la app, pero no es así. Lo configuras todo con tus datos personales y cuando terminas te dicen que debes pagar. Y a mi opinión no es barata.
Not accurate. The data on the app does not match the data on my computer when logged into QBO. This gets worse with the more time that passes by. The only way to fix this, at least temporarily, is to uninstall the app from my phone and reinstall it again. That is a real pain!  I will now delete the app all together!,
"No Way To Properly Export or Archive Your Data. I use Quickbooks Online for several companies. It works great until you realize there is no way to actually archive your data when you no longer need an active subscription.

I closed a business this year and no longer needed an active QBO subscription for it. When I went and looked for a way to save a copy of everything for audit purposes (CRA requires you keep a record of everything for several years after your business closes) there was no option to properly back everything up. Quickbooks support will tell you you can export some spreadsheets but they are incomplete. Attachments and receipts are not included. 

It seems the only way to properly keep my records if i happen to need them in the future is continue paying a monthly subscription. 

I should be able to download a complete copy of MY DATA whenever I want. 

Give this a quick internet search and see what a problem it is. Also notice how Quickbooks staff never directly answer this question in the forums. 

If you want to be stuck paying a monthly subscription even when you don’t need to use the product anymore than this is the product for you!"

Would be better if I could manage payroll on the app. I would love to be able to do up my company’s payroll on the fly if I’m out on a job site or on a business trip. Please fix this
Quickbooks online is great. I love being able to add expenses while on the road. I appreciate the snapshot of where my business is performing. It is great to have a record of what’s going on!
Great for Mobile. I have enjoyed using the app. Has what I need for most part.
Too much and too little.. The various plans either offer too many bells and whistles or not enough basic functions for a small company. Tons of redundant functions, and glitches are rampant. And quite frankly, except for the 1-2 year beginning subscriptions, the plan prices are overly expensive. Cannot recommend this program/app at all.
Worst App update. After updating the recently, App is crashing. Unable to login
"Customer Service is a Labyrinth of Incompentence. We are extremely dissatisfied with your customer services - it's a joke of 'customer service.' 

Quickbooks is just a facade because it doesn't really care for its clients. 

After hours of being on the phone with your Customer Service Labyrinth of Incompentence, we will take our business elsewhere and for every client that we have, we will tell them how awful Quickbooks is with it's robotic approach to Customer Service. 

It's a company that is very quick to take its money but takes no responsibility and accountability for when they drop the ball and make a mistake. 

It’s like the right hand has no idea what the left hand is doing. For an accounting software/company this is unacceptable."
Mileage tracking not working. The App works well except for mileage tracking
"Took out deposit option! WHY?. I can no longer record simple deposits from the mobile app. I’ve been using QuickBooks online for over a year now and make use of that functionality weekly.

Why did they take it away? Not every deposit is an invoice payment."
"Keeps crashing. Update: it’s still crashing. I can’t upload ANY receipts from my phone. 🤬 what’s the point of using it if I can’t upload my receipts! 

Every time I try to upload a receipt from my phone, it crashes when I press save & doesn’t save at all. I’ve tried closing the app & trying again, but it does it every time, so basically I can’t take a picture of any receipt & upload it. 

Please fix!

Update: I still can’t upload a receipt unless I take a picture of it elsewhere & upload vs taking a picture of it on the app."
NOT FREE. Wish there was an app like this for free the soon I started free trial next step was if I wanted 3months and pay or have a small discount and still pay /:
"Awesome for first-timers!. I am a new business owner and so far this is working out quite well for me. I’ll start by saying I’ve never taken any classes on business or economics, and as far as employment goes over the course of my adult life I’ve held jobs that require enough knowledge of basic accounting/billing, computer/software, (and other skills of the like) to get by on common sense. When it comes to taxes— that’s a foreign language to me and filing every year has been pretty simple (no major deductions, write-offs, etc. to worry about other than claiming dependents), so TurboTax is typically my go-to.

That said, and with this all being new to me, I’ve found that QuickBooks is surprisingly user-friendly and fairly easy to figure out. There are still a few things I look at and I’m like “huh?”, but the customer support is pretty on-point as easy to contact (and work with to get help from). Most of the App interface is self-explanatory and the layout is easy to follow— it’s comfortable, for lack of a better word.

Initially, I was going to rate this App at 5 stars because I’m diggin’ it so far... but decided to go with 4 for one reason only— I wish there were more options within the App (as opposed to the online version accessed from a desktop/pc). Too many times, I’ve found myself frustrated because something I want to (or need to) do requires you to log in and use the website and won’t allow the action from the App... and I can’t always get to a computer to do so. Especially since I work in the service industry (not from home or in any other stationary place of business) and I’m always running around or on-site somewhere, so my phone is often all I have to work with. That’s it. Other than that, it’s pretty awesome!"
Track Time. So far I’m pretty unhappy with this app because I thought that I could use it to track my time while I was with a client with a timer. I know that I read that somewhere when I was researching this app. That would have been a perfect feature. If this is something that I can actually do and someone can let me know how to do it I will change my rating to 4 or 5 stars.
"Please prioritise. Can you please forget about the fancy fonts and new colours!!
First repair the many bugs and crucial features missing from this app so we can operate our business efficiently. Once that’s done feel free to change as many fonts as you like."
Great program. I am a startup welding company, so computers are not my strong suit. Literally self taught with QB’s help section, and a couple video tutorials. I mange my companies financials, expenses and payables on my own. This is a big feat being a Neanderthal who sticks metal together.
App. Using this app is like being your own accountant.  It helps keep track of your income and expenses.  I highly recommend to all self employed people.
Amazing App!. Very good app! helps you learn a lot about coding!
Don’t use this with an IPad.. Bought this app and was unable to get it to work with an IPad. 4 hours on the phone with this company and still no success. They charged me and told me to get my money back through Apple. There is an open known problem being worked on their end but user’s beware. You won’t find out until you’ve paid.
App stopped loading after iOS update. Please fix
App needs major work. The app is useless, I have to pull out my laptop or wait till I get to my home or office.  I would love to use my iPad Pro, that I carry everywhere but the app is literally useless!!! Please fix asap
Glitchy, incomplete features, and poor data. This app needs serious attention.  After years of putting up with this hot mess I’m fed up and rarely use it any more.  No matter what I do I can’t get data to load that is any more recent than 2016 for most vendors.  No one from tech support replies - ever.   American Express transactions can’t be synched or approved in the app.  About the only thing it’s useful for is matching typical transactions in our checking account.
Not user friendly. I wouldn’t use this program if my accountant didn’t require it.  Updates totally screw me up as I have to relearn.  Latest update I can’t even put in a new deposit from several months ago because the program tells me the date is not valid.  The other thing is we are already paying for the program but they constantly want more money to do basic accounting practices; upgrades according to QB. I get tired of seeing popups that tell me this program doesn’t offer that feature.
"Questionable developers and QA. Don’t bother with this app. More time updating this weekly with version changes and bug fixes... 

Jokers

Edit; 29th Nov 2019 - this continues - just look at the version history log on the app..."
Complicated Interface, Terrible Customer Service. I am not an accountant by any means, but I was hoping Quickbooks Online would be easier to use for us average joes. Nothing about their program is intuitive- you are instead given loads of video tutorials and when that’s not enough you can call their Sales Department to get transferred to Customer Service (don’t try direct, it’s no use) who 9/10 times have thick foreign accents (which makes it even harder to understand the foreign accounting software) and if you’re lucky you get scripted answers with a side of sass. In my opinion, if your programming isn’t overwhelmingly user friendly you should at least have an overwhelmingly good customer service experience to give us all hope that we can, one day, figure it out. I am stuck with this program because my husband finds it easy enough to create and send an invoice, but unfortunately this leaves me to figure out the rest once a month. So all in all, thanks to Quickbooks Online our customers do know how much they owe us but as for the accounting, nobody knows what’s going on there.
Crashing. After 3 new updates in the last month app keeps crashing and losing everything I am doing.
Still in need of basic functionality. Timesheets are a must have feature for the mobile app.
Latest update is garbage. App has been great up until 3 weeks ago now it no longer works! Crashes every time I try to open the app.
"Clumsy, error prone, price has doubled.. Not a completely trash service, but it hasn’t gotten any better despite company promises. Price has doubled since I initially joined. iPad app bugged, today I tried to enter an invoice payment, no joy. 
Tried to leave service last year and the year before. Exporting info was a nightmare, and impossible on Mac, effectively leaving me held hostage.
Cancelling service at end of year as I’d rather try a different online accounting or simply go with a desktop version."
New update. I love the app and it has been great for us for years. However, the new update does not allow a custom date range for reports and when you edit an invoice it gives you a small screen that not everything fits on. Please bring back the custom date range and make is so we can see everything on edits.
"Lots that's good but some inexplicable limitations. 1. Can't click through to reports from dashboard eg unpaid invoices
2. In iphone and ipad version can't change or even see the P&L date period. Important if you want to understand your dividend/tax position.

Otherwise it's pretty good. The TV marketing is targeted at tradesmen which is fine but it also works quite well with more complex business models. However, if your company is manufacturing and you need management accountancy information as a business management tool (as opposed to simple reporting to the tax authorities) this doesn't cut it. My accountant is suggesting using excel as a work around. Better from within the package."
New update 11/20. Your new update is garbage. App shuts down immediately when it’s opened.
Crashing app. Latest update crashes constantly on iPhone 11 Pro. Fix it.
Find someone else.. Their help desk refuses to speak to the actual person who handles my business books and wanted to do nothing more then waste my time when I have business to run! Square is looking even better! 11/20/19 updated response to Quickbooks. The person was on the account and had full access. Again wasting time and money and horrible customer service.
"Extremely horrible customer service.. I ordered Quickbooks online via the App Store. Just as I was about to download, I realized it was the wrong thing I wanted. I called to cancel and I am currently on hold. The person took the call, I can hear all the conversations going on right now, I have been saying ‘hello, hello, hello’ and until now, no one has even answered the call. It’s 2 female voices and a male voice. One person has a cold or possible allergies as they are coughing. I have been on hold now for over 15 minutes. It appears that the person took the call, then forgot as I am neither on hold nor on mute.

I am still holding and no one has come to the phone, or has even realized that the phone is live. The female is talking about being real. 

Now the voices are getting closer to the phone. Had it not been that I want to make sure my account is not billed, I would have hung up. It took so long with the automated service to get this far, and now, no one is even answering the call. 

What I don’t understand is, do they not realize they are not getting any calls? And I am texting while on hold, do they not hear the tapping?

I am giving up right now. I hope this review is seen.

I was about to hang up when I heard the female voice say something about the phone. So I started pressing numbers, then I heard a male voice saying we’re closing at 9 o’clock. There was great laughter and talking, while I’m waiting on the phone. 

I am surmising that they meant to take the phone off the hook so as not to have calls, not realizing that someone was on the phone. 

Now there are more people in the room. Disgusting!

I am finally hanging up...over 30 minutes on the ‘phone, and no one came on. Today’s date 11/18/19. 9:19pm est."
"Not a trustworthy app. I have just started using this app in mid October and it is now Nov 18, 2019.  When I first signed on, I was offered to use the app for three months at $12.49 per month as a special promotion. Of course I clicked “ok” since I felt to really see if this app would work for me I would need three months to test it.

My first impression of this app was good because it did help me to organized all of my income and expenses in a neat clean application. In fact, I was able to balance my money and found missing money .  However, there where many time where I had to reset my phone because the app would freeze. This glitch prevented me from connecting my bank account and credit account to the app itself.  I figured I’ll give it another month to see if this problem gets fixed, I’ll trust it with my account numbers.  

Today it only allows me a (read only) version of this app unless I pay the full 24.99 a month, but I’m only on my 2nd month of the promotion that I signed up for.  I still would like to only pay $12.49 like I originally signed up for before I fully commit my entire business to use this app.  I haven’t even connected my credit or bank accounts yet because it still freezes from time to time.  I would not have entered all of my private information as well as my regular customer private information if I knew that intuit was going to go back on their offer on their promotion.  This kind of deal does not inspire trust in using this app.  I have a pic on my phone saying that this was the subscription I originally signed up for"
Useless. The app keeps crashing, if you’re in the middle of typing a long estimate or creating an invoice, it crashes and your file is gone, you have to keep saving your project, otherwise when it crashes, your project is gone. Very disappointed, going to a different app or software at the beginning of the year, three years with this crap, paying high monthly rates, and for nothing.
Ok... like seriously. I’ve used this App for 2019 mileage and expense tracking. But every week I have to reconnect my bank account. LIKE EVERY SINGLE WEEK! Why?? I don’t have time to do that. Fix this! Or I’ll be forced to find a better working service!
Great app but one major flaw. Overall this is a fantastic app that allows me to keep up on my books. There is one thing that is extremely annoying though.. the camera and auto crop feature is terrible! Please don't assume my images need to be cropped because the tool cuts off the image most of the time. Maybe make this optional?
"Buyer Beware. After just starting my new business I spent a month with the software and enjoyed all the features it had to offer.  However, when it came time to renew my subscription which I was prepared to do there was an issue with their billing system that didn’t allow me to subscribe.  After spending over 8 hours on 4 different phone calls and chat support over 2 days the only solution they’ve offered is to export my data, create a new account, and re-enter all of my data by hand.  Yep, that’s right, they have an import function but their export function doesn’t output in the proper format to import it back into their very own software!  All they offered was 40% off a 6 month subscription for my trouble (a $60 value) to cover the day I spent troubleshooting with them and the day or 2 it will take to re-enter all of my customer, invoice, and expense data by hand.

Their customer support people were friendly but were just following basic troubleshooting and even the supervisor I spoke with at the end was unable to make any headway putting a credit card on my account.  I’ll be checking out other solutions like Clientbooks since I don’t want to risk having my data being treated this way.

We tried that and in order to get the data out and “easily” back into Quickbooks Desktop I had to have a Windows 7 machine running a particular version of IE - seriously?  We even went further and tried to have your data management team do the conversion for me and even that was impossible since in order to do so I would have to add them as a user to my company data and I can’t do that since I can’t subscribe to add any more data (and apparently neither can you).  Honestly, it’s ridiculous that Intuit doesn’t allow the billing to be updated somehow by your backend team and are trying to make me jump through 100 hoops just to get back to where I was."
"Buyer Beware. After just starting my new business I spent a month with the software and enjoyed all the features it had to offer.  However, when it came time to renew my subscription which I was prepared to do there was an issue with their billing system that didn’t allow me to subscribe.  After spending over 8 hours on 4 different phone calls and chat support over 2 days the only solution they’ve offered is to export my data, create a new account, and re-enter all of my data by hand.  Yep, that’s right, they have an import function but their export function doesn’t output in the proper format to import it back into their very own software!  All they offered was 40% off a 6 month subscription for my trouble (a $60 value) to cover the day I spent troubleshooting with them and the day or 2 it will take to re-enter all of my customer, invoice, and expense data by hand.

Their customer support people were friendly but were just following basic troubleshooting and even the supervisor I spoke with at the end was unable to make any headway putting a credit card on my account.  I’ll be checking out other solutions like Clientbooks since I don’t want to risk having my data being treated this way."
"ONLINE VERSION NEED IMPROVEMENT. The online version specially on iPad is very difficult to use.

If the could make the iPad version like the desktop version GUI it would help.

The app is a little unstable because of the cookies and the background history that doesńt refresh the actual data timely.

Overall, it is a decent product they just need to make some tweaks."
Broken update. Your update broke the app.
"Closing. Can’t use this app without it crapping out on me. I need this to be reliable for my business and it’s not. Unfortunate really. 

Jeff"
"New update has stopped my app from working!!!. Since the update I now can’t accept anything or change anything!!!
The only thing I can do it add the expenses!!!!

Sort it out please!!!!!"
This app is harmful. Support is useless or you really can’t recover the emails you sending to the clients with your invoice
"Bank transfer. This is a great app with some unfortunate flaws. First, I love that they’ve added the mileage feature. I had to have the self employed app as well just for the mileage tracking. However, it is not always accurate and doesn’t always auto track. It will also put a random address and if you try to change the address, it doesn’t correct the appropriate amount of miles. You have to delete and manually add it. Also, you have to put in the right amount of miles when manually adding; it doesn’t calculate from the starting and ending point. So, if you don’t know the mileage off the top of your head, you have to go to another map and find out the distance. 
Second, I don’t recommend using the bank transfer feature. They hold the check for at least 4-5 days before releasing to your back so you’re looking at 7 days before the money shows up in your account."
To complicated. Don’t know how to get the max out of this app
Need an important upgrade. I love the app and all the updates but we really need to information from journal entries to show up in the expenses on the app.  It shows up on a computer but the app gives us false information.
"iPad use. Ok so it works but! You can’t edit the look of the invoice and even though it was setup on the computer to look a certain way, on the iPad it’s completely different and looks worse than a cheap $1.99 program you can get from the App Store. 

It would be good if the app mirrored the damn computer then I might even be usable. 
Other thing is, times sheets, not available on the iPad. So what’s the point?
I have payroll and I can’t even keep track of my workers times.
Useless !"
"Always have problems. This application made only to collect money from us and every time they increase their monthly payment 
Always have errors and problems and now big issues that i can not open the application on my phone and no one reply to our email or calls 
They are totally worst customer service ever"
No way to select India as a country. Hello I am using iPhone XS .. I downloaded ur app .. I am not able to select India as the country.. what seems to be the problem ?
"Waste of resources. So you have just put out an update saying how exciting that you have changed the layout and fonts... BIG whoop!! 

How about getting the program right first. As in the features that the web version do. Bundled items can’t be seen or edited in the app you  have to log into the web interface. Etc etc. posting a premium rate per month yet you can’t add basic features.  Priority people!! Oh wow a new font .... PFFFFT! :("
Horrible. App force closes. Give me a refund on my account if I can’t access it mobile..... 0 stars
19.11.2 awful update. First thing I noticed was there is no search bar for customers, so I have to scroll through thousands of customers to find the one I’m looking for. Secondly, I had hoped that we’d be able to view estimates and invoices in landscape mode to see them better, nope.  Then, when I tried to navigate back to the main customer list, there’s no back button! This version was nowhere near ready to be released.
Customer search bar is gone. I can’t search for clients when I’m in the app. Now I have to search and click in the left letters to get close to their name. I’m not able to search by phone number either. I’m very disappointed they made this change
Wish it had outlook. Awesome app. I wish I could send emails through outlook/hotmail instead of gmail. If there is a fix please advise.
"Subscription Hell. Terrible customer service.. When I first downloaded the app I was offered an introductory offer if I signed up for a subscription within 24 hours. £5.99 instead of the usual £12.99. Seemed like a good deal so I signed up on my work iPad with my work Apple ID

10 months in to the subscription I log into the app on my phone and a screen pops up to say I no longer have a subscription. So I quickly sign up to a subscription l, the only option being a full price £12.99. 

A couple days later I realise I’ve accidentally signed up with my personal Apple ID. So I cancel that subscription and log on to the app on my work IPad to sign up again with my work Apple ID.

Only to find out that I’ve been charged twice for the same month, on two different Apple IDs. 

Now I’m stuck because I’ve got a £5.99 subscription that’s not registering me as being subscribed on QuickBooks. Ideally I don’t want to cancel it, because I’ll have to revert to a £12.99 subscription. 

I’ve been unable to send any invoices for the past three weeks or log any of my receipts. 

I’ve tried to contact Intuit. I’ve emailed them, they don’t respond. Tried the live chat, doesn’t work. Spoken to them on the phone. Says there’s nothing they can do, I have to chase Apple for a refund. I told them I could email screenshot proof of all the issues I’m having. They gave me an email address. I send an email and they don’t bother responding to me. 

I go to report the issue to Apple and there webpage tells me to contact Intuit!!

Terrible customer service. No interest in sorting the issue out.

Update: Got another email from Apple to say that I’d gone into another month of my subscription. I’ve now cancelled it. So I’ve now paid three months and not had access to the app. 

I phoned Intuit one final time to resolve the issue. The best they could offer me was to transfer my subscription to Intuit. A full price subscription with a 30 day trial. Exactly the same as any new customer. They couldn’t do anything to compensate for the time I’ve been paying and unable to use their service. So they’ve lost my me as a customer.

Tried to get a refund from Apple and they said no."
New update 11/5. The new update is horrible!! I used to be able to search customers by address and the search bar is gone. Also, whatever screen I choose to be in, I have to fully close the app out to go back! What happened?!?!
No longer works properly. Since latest update I can no longer do anything in the Banking section. I can’t accept or change any transactions.
Works but limited reporting data. Running a business as a CEO is about reporting data to make decisions with, and be in the know all the time. This only has two reports you can pull and neither have the data I need to run my business on the go. Please allow custom reports to be pulled or add more reporting options because this is weak. I never do accounting on this app, I would use it all the time to have data at hand. The browser experience is phenomenal.
Accept transactions fixed. Latest update fixed accepting transactions.
Can't tap anything when looking at an individual transaction. Banking > New Transactions > View transaction let's you see what QuickBooks added but doesn't let you edit anything.
Great app. Yet again another update and even more glitches, you charge a fortune and cannot provide a decent service - I’m considering switching to a competitor as you have breached the contract that you have with me. This needs fixing URGENTLY and you need to refund subscription fees! My advice to businesses and the self-employed is do not use QuickBooks!
Can’t accept transactions. Latest update broke ability to match transactions. It’s like that screen is locked accept button/search or selecting another expense doesn’t work.
"Paid for my subscription twice, Intuit not interested in fixing the issue.. When I first downloaded the app I was offered an introductory offer if I signed up for a subscription within 24 hours. £5.99 instead of the usual £12.99.

Good app I’ve grown fond of. Makes my life 5 times easier. Definitely worth the money
"Newest update issue. Hi, 
I love this app and it normally works great. When i updated my ipad, I can no longer take payments because of a weird glitch that keeps the total amount $0 even if the item is $25. 
I emailed with screenshots. Giving you a heads up to look for that. At the moment, I can’t process any payments. It’s frustrating! Thank you."
Problem with update please fix. iPhone X, after updating the app, it doesn’t let me edit any transactions at all, I can only approve what is recognized transaction, an unrecognized transaction IS NOT RESPONSIVE TO TOUCHSCREEN COMMANDS so I have to cancel edit. Please fix
App has connectivity issues. Anytime I log into the app it causes me to have to re-link my bank accounts every time. If I stay out of the app everything works appropriately. I can log onto different devices through the browsers without issue but the second I log onto the app on a tablet or phone, it will disconnect my bank accounts.
Rubbish with IPad. Awful user experience working on IPad.  And no consistency with menu options when using mobile and web app.  It’s like using 2 different applications.
Accept button doesn’t work.. Love the app however this latest update the accept button doesn’t seem to work  so you can’t accept the new line items from your bank feed.
Effective App for accounting.. Yes.
App has gone downhill since update. Youve just done an update and hardly anything works. Buttons are unresponsive and crashes! Sort it out
Crash with IOS13. App does not launch.
"Why don’t we have the snap and sort option in the UK?. This app is amazing but I am disappointed that we in the UK do not have the snap and sort on the on the go option, which apparently the self employed app has and so do the Americans. 

Whenever you take an image of a receipt with this version, you have to fill in all the information immediately or it won’t save. This is an absolute waste of time when one has things to do. All we need is a software update of that option and we are good to go. 

Come on software developer team, give us the update too. This would make running my business fantastically smooth."
CC Payment Signature Window. Love the app but, something was changed in one of the recent updates. The screen for the customer to sign to authorize CC payment was made into smaller window. Every time you touch it to try and sign, it just moves the window up and down. You can barely make a single line. Starting to get frustrating for customers and myself.

Ability to get paid, in my pocket. If all the QuickBooks app allowed me to do was create and send invoices on the fly, I would pay for it. It is that and a lot more.
Low Rating Until the App Supports Chart of Accounts. The app continues to be under developed for functions that are developed in the web interface. The app is excellent for invoices and credit card transactions if you have a merchant account coupled to your QBO account. The camera can be used in app to document your receipts to the cloud and I use it extensively for hotel/airfare/rental car expenses and they can be attached to invoices when emailing your customers.
Valuable tool to have in the field. I installed the app, imported company files from my desktop and boom I was doing estimates and invoices in the field.
"If you don’t use quickbooks you’re probably wasting a lot of time.. I find the day to day management of my business much easier and less time consuming since I started using quick books. 

As with everything, it isn’t perfect. I would like to see more features on the mobile app. That being said, I only use the app and it works well for me. 

Customer service is excellent. They strive to resolve any issue you throw at them. 

I would highly recommend!"
Problems. The app have now problems I recommend to check that I was using the app for 3 years but now is a disaster
"Dreadful just unusable plus desktop version same. Started well. Then couldn’t input expenses on the app. Hard and long winded to get support. 
NOW CANT ENTER INVOICES AND RECIEPTS ON DESKTOP VERSION!!
Totally pointless package and when you have r Pugh troubles running your own business!!!!! 
Think I will go back to my accountant and just dump everything with him each month as the hours this is costing me plus unbelievable stress!!!!"
Great app. Can do so much on the app. Would be even better if could prepare bills in the app.
Too many glitches. I love QuickBooks and I love that they have an app but there are a lot of glitches in the performance. The screen goes blurry, logs you completely out of the system inconveniently, customer list is unlined with the screen, there are more but minor.
Broken and no support. QuickBooks online worked well for a few months but then suddenly our estimates and invoices don’t print out the service dates or captured signatures anymore. After customer support was not able to resolve the issue we get a call a week later from their technical department saying that they found a corruption in the database and asking for over $2,000 to fix it. We were given an excuse that sudden loss of connection could be the cause of the corruption. Needless to say we are going to be moving all of our transactions to another product. Sorry but you cannot run an online cloud product where the customer has no control over the database and have a mobile version where the customer has no control over the connection, and then blame the customer for corrupted databases and ask for a ridiculous amount of money just to fix it. Worst customer service and I will never recommend QuickBooks or ever use it again.
App times out occasionally during entry. App times out occasionally while I’m using it. When that happens it deletes the transaction I was working with.
"Awful program. Glitchy... no help at all from customer service, I paid my fee and they used it to open a new account instead of paying for the one I had.

“Unable” to refund me...  I spent three hours on the phone today with three different people, absolutely no help, no service, no one has any idea what the hell they’re doing, a very poorly run company.

Disappointed"
Incredibly glitchy. The app is glitchy despite updates.  I’m not super impressed by Intuit in general.  I use their payroll for my business, a lot of glitches there too.  App crashes or spontaneously exits my selections to “accept” for no reason and I have to start over.  Does not learn well, I have to reteach things over and over.
*Terrible app*. Do not take the chance with this program its flawed at best and is only designed to take as much money off you for as long as possible. It has multiple errors all the time. Find something for better value and don’t pout it in control of your business because when it fails you have no control whatsoever.
App need more functionality. It would be great if we can do transfers and journals on the Quickbooks app.
Needs to be full featured. I love the program but hate that I can’t do into my vendor bills on the app for iPad. I can’t enter them in or view them on iPad. I can on browser view but even it needs to update as everything gets cit off in chrome and when you click the menu button to hide it it does not slide everything over so you can see more.
Works well but need enhancements. The app works well and easy to use. I will appreciate if it can be enhanced to accommodate advance payments and accruals
"Questionable developers and QA. Don’t bother with this app. More time updating this weekly with version changes and bug fixes... 

Jokers"
Great. I’m loving this app
HORRIBLE. Do not waste your time or money. After a while they hold your money and cause a ton of financial difficulties for companies who rely on getting paid. There customer service is BS..........Do not use
Quickbooks. Awesome app.
"Excellent Customer Service. I have been using Quickbooks for a short while now but have found the app to be very user friendly and easy to use, one thing I wanted to mention was the OUTSTANDING customer service I received when I spoke to Tom on the phone when setting up my account, he was very helpful and gave me faith that Quickbooks is a platform that I will continue to use and feel like I have my own little team behind me helping every step of the way!

Thankyou so much!"
"Where are the invoices??. What is the point of an accounting app that does not show supplier invoices? 

Dreadful. Support was as helpful as a chocolate teapot too ..."
"Ends up costing you more money and time.. This app and program have software flaws that will end up costing you money (the vacation pay calculator is still not working). Their phone support reps are trained that well and make mistakes and errors that will cost you time and money.  And quickbooks will not refund you any money they cost you for their own mistakes.  One rep told me they had filed my T4 summary when they had not.  After finding out months later and getting a penalty... quickbooks refused to pay. 

Avoid and try other products"
Horrible... if it opens ...!. I run a small remodeling business and try to keep track of miles... this app I thought would be ideal. I think it has only added a level of frustration that wasn’t there when I did it by notebook. It works, but only sometimes and keeps track of some trips and not others. I am using the trial version but I can’t believe this is something they want money for ... surely there is something better.! It is not user friendly either.
"App keeps crashing. Please fix your app... I pay a lot of money a month for your service and this app is terrible. For the most part i have to log into the online service to do any work. 
Please fix your app"
Background usage accounts for 50 percent of battery life. This app completely drains my battery. I thought my battery was broken and was about to replace it, but Apple tech report suggested I check on battery usage by app and I discovered Quickbooks was the culprit.
Simple and easy. I find the app and the computer program simple and easy to navigate. I operate my small business using QuickBooks and I am yet to have an issue.
I hate QB. When I started using QB fifteen years ago it was an awesome little program that didn’t cost too much and had everything I needed. Now it is a gargantuan pile of slag and I can’t get out as it would take too much time to transfer all my data to different software. It’s glitchy, freezes, has data entry problems and their support is basically ‘we are very sorry you’ve had this problem, we will email you in the future’.  I haven’t used the app much but I’d highly recommend you don’t get stuck in QB!
"Tax Rates/Counties are incorrect. When I create an invoice from this app, it doesn’t select the correct county even when I manually change it. It causes it to transfer back to desktop version as the wrong county when saved and will not account for that county. PLEASE FIX

10/8/19 ***STILL NOT FIXED*** This has been going on for the better of 6 months..WHY HASN’T THIS BEEN FIXED?? The app keeps sending the wrong county information to the main server which causes me to manually have to change it from the desktop version. I can’t change it manually from the app. This makes my job harder and I have complained several times...I understand there can be bugs, but this has been a known issue and still not addressed."
"Good & Bad. -Not happy with the customer service. One of the reasons I went to online in the first place was so I could call with problems/questions. Now I have to dig through the site to MAYBE get my questions answered. I sent a question in yesterday & never did get a response. 

-Love that I can use Quick Books on my phone. I rarely drag out my laptop these days. When I do, I’m grumbling. 

-Love that I can take photos straight from the app to include w/my invoices. 

-I hope statements will one day be an option on the app. It would be great to be able to batch several invoices for my busier clients."
Tons of bugs and glitches. There are lots of glitches and lack of features in this app. The vendor transaction history is spotty, many vendors and missing history all together. Profit and loss report doesn’t scroll. Can’t see the true checkbook register of checks that are written out but haven’t yet cleared. It’s really not very good.
Awesome. Such a great package. It made my life so easy with the phone app that I can raise invoices and quotes on the go. It also makes your business look heaps bigger and professional by having proper invoicing that allows taking signature on quotes too. Loving it.
Stop trying to make mileage tracking happen, it's not going to happen.. It's fine to ask me *once* if I would like to track mileage through the app. It's *not* okay to ask every time I open the app. It's not a service I need, it's not a service I use. Stop shoving it in my face and stop asking me to use it.
"Take me back. New updates are awful. Keeps crashing..unable to do simple functions on the go such as editing invoice, sending a statement, etc. Old version was much better. 

Change it back to how it was..not every update is a good update. Especially not this one."
Service after the Sale is Nonexistant!. I’ve been trying to get incorrect billing corrected for almost a month now.  Customer Service directs me to my sales rep and the sales rep no longer responds to emails from me or his coworkers in Customer Service.  Try WaveApps...it seems to be comparable to the Simple Start plan and it’s FREE!
Help with my subscription. It says error downloading product information
Updates that don’t install. First of all got up to install and it won’t
"Worst customer service. It’s like Comcast great product but terrible customer service.
I have online payroll service with them and I have been trying to merge my desktop Quickbook version to online and bundle
Every time I call they transfer the phone to the Philippine and they try to sell me the service that I already have (payroll) .
It’s either they charge for full service or they irritate people."
Does not work. App does not work.  Wish it did, but it does not.  None of my vendor activity shows up, profit and loss does not scroll past first page.  Better no app at all than one that does not work.
"Good but need more adding. Covers all your needs a lot of options,
Nice app, few missing things like no specific area for the barcode when you creat a new item.
It’s friendly use but need more simplicity 
Other than that it’s ok"
Can’t attach pictures to expenses any more. The latest update does not allow you to attach an existing photo (for example, a picture of a receipt) to an expense. When you select the picture, there’s no button to add it to the expense. In fact, the picture is presented with no buttons or links on the page anywhere, which leaves you stuck with no way out. The only thing to do is force quit the app. Apparently this problem started with iOS 13 and Intuit has released app updates since then, but for some reason they refuse to acknowledge or fix this bug.
Can’t subscribe after trial period. It’s a good QuickBooks version but I started trial period made a profile and invoices but the app won’t let me renew subscription the buy now button doesn’t work when clicked on. Now I may have to start another profile and lose everything?
"Needs lots of improvements. QuickBooks is good but lacks a lot of features specially now that the iPasOs is out, 

1. The attachment system should completely change. 
2. Slide over and side by side must improve as the app is not responsive 
3. It does not recognize email addresses copied in iOS (mailto:)
4. Cannot send statements to customers
5. Cannot add company stamp and signature on the invoices 
6. Converting an estimate to invoice, does not automatically copy the terms and conditions. 

Hoping for more improvements in the app."
Crashes with iOS 13. Just a heads up. When you try to take a picture of a receipt to upload to the account, the app freezes up and you can’t continue on. Restarting the app doesn’t work either.
"RIP OFF. I just tried to log on on a different device and I’ve been charged again!!

1. The app fails to log in my bank details and after contacting quick books on numerous occasions they can’t fix it and tell me that they are working on it.

2. After 3 years of asking you still can’t print from the app you have to email it to yourself it some strange format that won’t print on standard A4.

DONT BELIEVE THEIR REPLY WHICH THEY WILL ADD BELOW AS YOU SIMPLY CANT PRINT FROM THE APP,"
Amazing App. Wouldn’t be able to run my business without QuickBooks. Thank you for the prompt iOS 13 update!
Great app. Best software for small business, better priced than other software on the market.
Can’t attach existing photo with iOS13. With iOS 13 you cannot upload an existing photo to a new expense. When you select a photo, the app freezes and there’s no button to accept the photo.
Not a good app. Too many bugs.
"Moron developers and QA. Don’t bother with this app. More time updating this weekly with version changes and bug fixes... 

Jokers"
Loads of bugs since updating to iOS 13. Broken links. Can’t call up customer information. Dashboard only shows Banking information. Invoices and Estimates haven’t saved when generated on mobile device.
Now works with IOS13. Just updated IOS 13 app appears to be working on IOS13.
"This has been fixed: App does not function properly on iOS13. Update 9/23/2019:
The below issue was entirely resolved with update 19.9.3. THANK YOU!

Updated to iOS13, immediately after, QuickBooks app version 19.9.2 stopped allowing me to save invoice payments from clients, and stopped slowing me to bill labor...giving me all sorts of various errors. I’ve deleted and reinstalled the app, I’ve logged out and back in. I’ve rebooted. Nothing resolves. I’m going two days of not being able to run my business and have folks enter their labor in the field, or accept payments from clients because of this issue. I’ve reported it to intuit twice already. Fingers crossed for a fix by Monday."
Unusable in ios 13. After login, app crashes every time. I tried deleting and reinstalling as well. iOS 13.0. Please fix asap.
"iOS 13 killed the app. The apps is not working with the new iOS 13.0
You can connect but when trying to create an invoice it says “Error, the quantity is larger than the maximum allows” even when the quantity is only one. 
When trying to send an invoice it says “Error, email too long” 
I did a fresh install of the app and still does the same. 
I called tech support but the person who answered the phone needs more help than I do. 
Please resolve the issue ASAP"
Should have been ready for iO13. I waited patiently while running the iO13 beta & this app not working. But now that the official iO13 public release is available I have to give this 1 star, 0 if I could. The app just crashes!! QuickBooks, you should have had your app ready way before this public release.
cant even start the app. how to rate A app that not even running
Recent update. Thursday I updated my IOS, then updated the app. It’s now crashing after sign in. Please fix this, my phone is a XR
Crashing. Since moving to iPhone11 pro - the app keeps crashing. Can’t even access it! Please fix this as I have to upload receipts to my laptop to add to quickbooks! Ain’t nobody got time for that........
Unusable. Stopped working after ios 13 update, can't add expenses and support is unresponsive
Pay attention to billing ~ unethical business practices. Intuit upgrades subscription and charges more than advertised price when you are not looking.  Horrible customer service - unable to reach by phone to resolve their seemingly intentional billing errors.  They practice Unethical business behavior, but switching costs are very high once accounts are set up.
ios 13 crashing. app crashing after password screen , ios 13 is not compatible with this app at present , considering the amount my company pays for quickbooks i’m disappointed to say the least .
App Crashing in IOS 13. Please note that the app is crashes in IOS 13. Have not been able to open it sine updating. Otherwise it is a fantastic application.
Inaccurate balances from the program to my checking account. The app continues to have a different balance from my checking account. I have zeroed out the account several times and restarted but it continues to apply something incorrectly with the downloading of the account transactions.
Crashing in iOS 13. Crashing in ios13 can’t even open the app .. having trouble managing my business
Invoice won’t work with iOS 13. I’m trying to put a new customer in on a invoice and the app just turns black and white screen. Plz update! I run my entire business off this app
"Barely acceptable. iOS 13 update: now you can’t even create a customer without soft-locking the app, awesome!

Tldr; Tracking work and getting paid are either impossible or broken via the app, but are functional in the online app, mostly.

There are major features lacking in the app: you cannot add delayed charges from the app, invoices generated on the web are present but not *visible* in the app!

Your customer asks you ""what do I owe you"" and you pull up your fancy app to show him only to get an error that the invoice was created on the web so you then waste time to dig it out of your email, all the while feeling like a fool for agreeing to a perpetual subscription for incomplete functionality.

This is your life with QuickBooks Online. 

Accepting payments via app is a chore: to simply select your customer (which you must do for each payment) entails several annoying steps:

1. Load payment screen (two taps)
2. Tap ""select customer"" (no in-line search!)
3. Tap search *button* to reveal search bar 
4. Tap search *bar* to bring up keyboard
5. Tap the customer

How could this critical workflow be so poorly executed?

Receiving payment is the actual purpose of QB right? 

Since most businesses have more than a screen-full of customers it might be a sane default to just start a customer search as soon as a payment is selected, saving 5 taps. At least focus the keyboard to start searching when you tap the search icon, saving 3 taps.

Speaking of getting paid, though not directly  related to the app: QuickBooks payments is a broken product, you send an invoice with a balance forward and your customer has no option to pay balance forward, so you're stuck explaining to customers that the bill they just paid is not the *entire* bill, awesome."
No longer works with iOS 13. I just updated to iOS 13. The app now crashes immediately after it tries to launch my company. I tried reinstalling it but no luck. Please fix this asap!
Not working after ios13 update. Updated to apples latest software and this app stopped working
IOS 13. I’ve updated my iPhone 8 to iOS 13 and QuickBooks won’t load at all. I’ve deleted and re uploaded the app and it’s the same. Any updates coming soon for the app? Other than that, don’t update your phone if you rely on QuickBooks in your phone
App isn’t working after updating to ios 13.. App isn’t working after updating to ios 13.
iPhone 11 fail. Can’t get this app open on new phone. Was never a problem before!
"Crashes almost immediately. Running iOS 12 and then 13 on an iPhone 8. Installed the app. Put my login info in. 
Accepted that no problem. Then boom. App crashes and I’m back to my iPhone home screen. Rebooted my phone. Deleted and reinstalled the app. Makes no difference. Still crashes. 
Having this app was a big factor in my decision to run my business on quickbooks and now I’m reconsidering that before I get any deeper."
"App Crashes on iOS13.0 & 13.1. I’ve just updated the app and it’s still crashing on iOS13.0 and also 13.1.
I have tried to make contact with the developers via the support page but it also loads to blank pages after opening chat."
"Crashing at start up with iOS 13. Love this app but it crashes with iOS 13 :( 
Please fix"
Ios13. Can you fix the app?
Crash issues. This app crashes on the new iPhone 11 pro max using iOS 13. Please release updates to resolve the issue.
App crashing ios13. App is crashing in io13
Great app when it works.... After update to iOS 13 as well as the latest version of the QBO app, I cannot access supplier information. On top of that, I am unable to save expenses that I am trying to enter too. There goes the productivity. QBO team really need to be better at this!
Don’t update to iOS 13 if you want this to work. There a so many bugs with this app now that IOS version 13 has been released. You can’t even enter an expense now without an error popping up that you need to create a template. QuickBooks online support has been no help. They advised I use the browser on my phone. What’s the point of the app then? Test test test folks.
Worthless on ios13. Out of all the apps I have, this is the only one that wasn’t ready for iOS13.  It was worthless during the entire public beta process & I was hoping with the actual iOS 13 release, it would be updated. Not the case, still worthless. Doesn’t work on my iPhone or iPad. It was the convenience of having QuickBooks on the go that sold me in the first place. Not the case anymore.
Crashes. App is unusable after iOS 13.0 update.. Crashes. App is unusable after iOS 13.0 update.
Keeps crashing. I absolutely love this app...but since iOS 13 install every time I go to use it, it crashes. I sent an email to support but need this rectified.  Once that glitch is fixed it’s a 4.5 star app!
"Was enjoying it until ios13 update. This app was working fine until i updated to ios13...... Boom!
Nothing now.
Crashes on opening everytime."
App crashes. The app crashes immediately when I try to open it. I haven’t been able to use the app for a few months now which is quite disappointing considering I pay for its services.
app crashes in ios 13 & 13.1 .. app crashes in ios 13 & 13.1 . customer service had no clue
Crashing after ios13 update!. App is crashing after Face ID log in on XS Max ios13
iOS 13 crash. An awful app that is made even less useful in iOS13 because it just crashes straight after running.
IOs 13. App crashes before opening! Please fix ASAP!
Great app. App is great and worked well with my iPhone X but just updated to iPhone 11 pro Mac and app will not open crashes and closes every time please fix
iOS 13 incompatible. Was using this app, working fine on my iPad with iOS 12 but updated phone to iOS 13 and will not load app but crashes every time I open it. I’m not paying for a dud app. Fix it or refund my subscription.
"After iOS 13 Update. After updating to iOS 13 the app is not opening and I couldn’t use it....
Please look into it and give us a solution"
Please Fix it !. With ios13 the app is crashing all the time , for example when a I select a client immediately crash
"Quickbook app is  it working after updating iPhone to the latest version iOS 13. When you open the app it auto close.
Basically can’t open the app"
Keeps crashing in iso 13, can’t even start up. Didn’t they have enough time to test before the final release of iOS13? Minor issues are one thing but the app doesn’t even start, that’s a sev1 that should have been caught long time ago.
Crashing. Updated to iOS 13 and now the App keeps crashing after Face ID, please get this sorted as I can’t run my business
App isn’t working now. Please advise. It has stopped working. I click on the app and it automatically closes. New iPhone today should work unless not compatible with ios13.
"iOS 13; don’t do it!. If you need this app to work correctly do not upgrade to iOS 13 yet! Many bugs...
My worst bug: Can’t look at ANY customer info anymore, does not work.
Yes I uninstalled and reinstalled..."
App does not function properly on iOS13. Updated to iOS13, immediately after, QuickBooks app version 19.9.2 stopped allowing me to save invoice payments from clients, and stopped slowing me to bill labor...giving me all sorts of various errors. I’ve deleted and reinstalled the app, I’ve logged out and back in. I’ve rebooted. Nothing resolves. I’m going two days of not being able to run my business and have folks enter their labor in the field, or accept payments from clients because of this issue. I’ve reported it to intuit twice already. Fingers crossed for a fix by Monday.
"Can’t record invoice payments. I upgraded my phone from an iPhone 8 Plus to an XR running iOS 13. I installed the QuickBooks app from the Apple Store. When I try to record invoice payments, I get the following error: QBM.ERROR.00001160.REASON.IPHONE

I have not found any articles about this error online."
No Mileage Tracking. False advertising. The mileage tracking screen shot is from the self employed app, not the small business app
"No Longer Works. This used to be a brilliant App. Emphasis on “used to be”. For over a month the App hasn’t worked.
It crashes before you can log in.

I spoke to someone in the call centre that said, “they’re aware of the issue and are working on a resolution”. Well, it’s been nearly two months and the App still doesn’t work. Don’t buy a subscription if you want to use the App because you won’t get your money’s worth. Yes, I can use my laptop and send invoices from my laptop, but that doesn’t help me track expenses when I’m out and about via my mobile right there and then."
Doesn’t work for me in ios13. It doesn’t even get to the first page. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling but same issue. Please fix what is normally a decent app.
iOS 13 not supported. The app will not even start!
Quickbooks online not working. I paid my subscription thru iTunes, got charged but haven’t been able to use it.... It keep giving me a message to subscribe which I already did. Contacted apple, iTunes, and intuit quickbooks and haven gotten anywhere... Frustrating!!!
This app does not function properly on ios13. I cannot view any customer files. I can search for them, but the app will not let me click on a customer to edit invoices.
"Keeps crashing. Every time I try to upload a receipt from my phone, it crashes when I press save & doesn’t save at all. I’ve tried closing the app & trying again, but it does it every time, so basically I can’t take a picture of any receipt & upload it. 

Please fix!

Update: I still can’t upload a receipt unless I take a picture of it elsewhere & upload vs taking a picture of it on the app."
Doesn’t work with IOS13. Just updated IOS 13 app doesn’t load. Even after deleting and re-adding.
Dirty Tactics for Subscription. Unsubscribing to this app is so difficult. An error prompt always appears everytime I process unsubscribing. But if it’s any form of purchase, upgrading, downgrading, anything other than unsubscribing works just fine. No reply from their customer service since I contacted them a few weeks ago. I hope other people who has the same problems with this app comes forward so this developer stops milking money from unwilling customers.
Hong Leong Connect First. I don’t get to link to my Leong Connect First account. Please fix this so that I use it right away. My sister told me this app is superb.
"Crashes every time. When app is installed I can log in to my account. Then the app says « downloading data » and when download is complete it crashes.
If I open it again (so still logged in), I cant even get past the launch screen."
Purchased but won’t work.. I can not contact customer service to save my life!!  I purchased this after my trial but it won’t acknowledge that I have. Very upset and frustrated!!!
Ios 13 and later app crashes. The app works well prior to iOS 13.0 when opened in an iPhone running iOS 13 later, the app crashes after faceid login.
Drafting Estimates. When drafting estimates, system should auto save as many times hours of work is erased if you don’t constantly save before stepping away. In addition when you click the description box there should be an undo button in case it grabs all the text and it gets erased by pressing any button in accident. Two very simple and logical things.
Love the app, but price is too high. I love the app, but when will the price increases stop. As soon as I have time to research other programs I will cancel my subscription. $40 per month is too much to just invoice customers and reconcile my bank statement.
"Not easy to do it all on app. Find trying to complete and send vat return a headache.
Also we use Coop bank doesn’t tie up with QB
Nor does it with Starling business bank"
"Recommend for one stop  Booking & Accounting. I tried many softwares for accounting , the only reason I choose this platform because of its graphics & designs , the dashboard itself give you a ray of positivity , they design the dashboard and entire platform graphics in future aspect. Apart from it there customer service is also and helpful. 

Cheers !!
Ashutosh"
Don’t waste your time. The developer is very slow to fix bugs and non responsive when a complaint or ticket is generated. The tax rates are a total mess in the app. There is very little control over adding new or editing existing rates generated by qb while using the online version. Any time I use an apple product I have the same issue.
Can’t do the most basic things. I have been a QB online user for a number of years. However using the app on my iPad, I find it extremely frustrating as it appears they put very little effort into the app versus the online desktop version. If you think about it, what are the two most basic things you need to do in QuickBooks? Seeing what invoices are due to you from customers and what invoices you owe vendors. Both of these you cannot do in the QB online app. When I called, they asked for my account number and you cannot even find that in the app. Ultimately they advised me to not use the app and to login through Safari.
This app is a business saver!!!. This is a must app for every business!
Pointless. Useless app. Can’t even see any supplier invoices etc. What is the point of having the app if you can’t work fully on the go!?
"Ran into unsupported transactions within 1 minute.. The app is difficult to navigate, bloated and slow, using a ton of wireless data.  

The app would be much better as multiple single-function apps.  I mean, do I really need to log in to QB to snap a pic of a receipt and submit it for later?  Typical QuickBooks bad experience.

Very disappointing."
Needs improvement. QuickBooks online is great but the App needs a lot of work to bring up to the same standard. As others have said, the App shows “Expenses” but not “Bill payments” - so the account details on the App don’t match the online reporting. I have stopped using the App as it only shows an incomplete part of the story and does not give me confidence that it represents an accurate snapshot of my business. At first I thought there was a problem syncing between my online version and the App version until I was told it is actually due to the App version only supporting “Expenses”. QuickBooks have clearly known of this for some time, but it needs to be fixed.
"Awful app - doesn’t fully sync with online data. I keep getting notifications about a 6 month overdue invoice, which I used for testing. However, when you try and remove the invoice, it can’t find it.
The online version is fine if a little overpriced for sole-trader business, but this app, which costs nothing, is worth exactly that. It’s next to useless."
Good app poor customer service. Was trying to switch over my account settings and the representative I had helping me seemed very lost and wasn’t of any help. Still confused on how to swap my account to a different package and receive refunds on duplicate charges. Really quite frustrated. Besides that the app itself provides the services I need.
Worst user experience, terrible app and product. I’ve spent the last four hours attempting to use what should be easily configurable software, or at least is billed that, and this is absolute rubbish. There’s no way to modify a beginning balance contrary to what the “help” says, there’s no way to separate expense categories beyond the few default ones, and I am shocked that software that is this widely used is such a terrible user experience. Both the web access and the iPad app are kludgy. Don’t do it.
Great but could make better. It’s a great product but I would like to be able to view and print my QuickBooks invoice through the app. Not sure why I can’t do this ?
Poor service, poor quality product. This product is the worst I have had to deal with. Service is non existent, the app is constantly in errors, backing up is slow, the system does manual and not by the operator, Everytime the + symbol is used it closes the app. My accountant doesn’t even like the system. I have loaded, unloaded and reloaded the APP so many times it’s no longer a joke. Quick books tells me they fixed the fault, like never.
"Rubbish. I hate apps that first want you to sign up before you can try OR see info re any costs.  This is one of them.

I signed up yet still can’t try it as it asks I try a 7 day free trial first.  Well, I don’t mind but I’d like to see what I’m getting before signing my life away.

I don’t want every app to have my email.

As it is, after all the signing up this app isn’t what I want and is too fussy.

NEXT !!!!!!!"
Not for the iPad or iPhone. The app does not Support STP... have to access using web browser on iPad iPhone . So don’t buy the app if you want to use it for STP. Browser access Using an iPad Pro , you won’t be able to scroll down or access command icons because they are beyond the margins of the iPad screen. Can’t finish inputting categories because the screens won’t scroll at all
Very powerful tool. The app is really nice and efficient. Will get even better when the ability to create a credit note is made available on both IOS and Android devices. I really don't understand why this must have feature has not been added yet.  Thanks!
"Buggier and more expensive than ever. Don’t believe the five star reviews. Intuit has somehow been able to monopolize bank feeds in order to force us to use its second rate software. This app is the slowest and buggiest app on my phone, but also the most expensive. 

The latest bug is that you can’t change the date when you enter transactions. It only records today’s date. It’s been like this for about two months now, just as they announced big price hikes because of all the “improvements” they’ve made. These people really have a lot of nerve."
Bug fixed. Your problem with app
"Needs Sort Projects Function. This app needs a function to sort projects by priority or due date; just as I have requested I have a dozen times in QuickBooks online accountant. As far as I can tell this app would do me no good; it’s just something to look at, not actually do any work in. Which would be fine for me. 

But it would be nice, on the fly, to be able to see what work is needed to be done by my staff, and, to see it as it’s due, not just a list of the projects by Customer. That’s not beneficial at all."
Impossible to print packing slip from app?. I would give Quickbooks a 5 if it wasn’t so dang hard to print a packing slip from my phone either through the app or quickbooks online. Ugh.
Needs to be QB Online, this app is something else entirely.. The iPad version of this program (and Android for that matter) really need to match - exactly match - the web version accessed through QuickBooks online in a web browser.  The differences are notable, and the experience moving from one version to another is unpleasant.  I can’t recommend the iPad version of this program.
Good app and service. After the last update, I can’t create an invoice after I add a customer. It crashes every time on my iPad. It still works on my phone. Please fix this issue.
"Poor sales tax function. I have been using this app almost 20 months now. I like almost all abilities, except for the sales tax portion. When making an invoice one must click on the tax bar near the bottom of the page, a menu appears and you can select the tax district that you are currently doing business in. Problem is the same district is listed several times causing real problems when the time comes to print a report and submit payment to the state. I have called the tech line several times and wasted many days trying to correct. There is no actual human or team that will assist with app problems. You can get help for online versions for you PC but not a tablet. Stay Away 
QB will not back this product!"
Receipt capture used to be great - now useless. The receipt capture used to be one of the most beneficial things about the QB mobile app, but with an update a while ago, it doesn’t work at all anymore. Takes 3 times as long because you have to manually crop the images where as it used to pick up and recognize the receipt against the contrasting surface it was on and automatically and effectively crop it to just capture the receipt itself. I really wish they’d fix this feature so it worked well again!!
"Great App but..... I love QB, I’m a small business owner and have been using it faithfully since 2016. My one beef is that I cannot send invoice reminders or share invoice links from the iPhone app, I have to send from my laptop. This is not a major inconvenience but when I’m at the airport or on the go, it is extremely tedious. Please make an update to allow users to send invoice reminders and share invoice links via smartphones!!!!

One note: it does give the option to send a reminder on my phone but once you click on it the next screen shows up as sending the invoice regular. It’s a glitch."
The app. My husband and I decided to start a new business, we shopped around for good companies to write estimates, invoices, keep track of what’s coming in and out of our accounts etc. we have found this system super easy to understand and we both caught on very quickly. The phone app is even better! Since we do a lot of our estimates in the car it’s easier for me to just pull out my phone on spot and give homeowners an estimate as quickly as possible. Very easy to learn your way around!
"Love this app!. Love this app but it would be great if they allow me to include ""Shipping Date"" for the invoices generated on mobile"
Interstate_g. I’m a young entrepreneur. No degrees and some college classes in my background. When I say that this app is easy and straightforward forward, helps me run my business, and does most of the work. Easy is an understatement. If accounting is your barrier in your buisness look no harder cause qb is the answer.
Terrible app. Half the time I can not download my banking info, I can not do invoices. It’s junk for what you have to pay for it. I’m finding something new.
Literally crashes every time I try to enter a sale.. Great for tracking expenses but useless for processing and tracking sales. Very disappointed.
"So much better than Sage. We moved from Sage to this and haven’t looked back. The app is better and the links to banks work (unlike Sage). 

The help and support is better than Sage too. All in all, well worth a trial."
"Worth It!. I got the 10$/month plan and it is totally worth it! You can connect your bank and organize all your expenses. View reports and detailed graphs! Even plan future investments! 

It’s handy on iOS mobile (IPhone 8). And IMac."
App keeps crashing. App keeps crashing since i got my new iphone. It opens then closes right away. I’ve tried deleting and installing again, I’ve tried rebooting phone; nothing works. Any suggestions would be helpful. Thanks
Price just keeps going up!. Forced to moved to a different app, found this one for £2.99 a month, which seemed fine as I won’t be using it very much. Now the price has gone up to £11.99 in under a year! Needs different payment options for those that don’t use it much and that % increase is insane.
"Need to be able to add bills and accept Transactions’s that should match to bills. I think the title says it all. QBO is amazing such a great product but the app needs more functionality. 
Mainly the bills, I need to add a bill from my phone and then be able to match multiple bills as one payment to relevant bills on payment. So frustrating having to find a computer to do this."
App is changed for the worse. I am not sure when this happened, but the app is now useless and does not have the functionality it used to have. I now need to do everything on computer. Not good.
Amazing App. I got this because of Danny Devito
Count on almost $500/yr in subscription costs. Intuit has been very smart about hiding needed features in higher sub plans. Get going for a while and you’ll find you need the highest tier subscription. No thanks. Hello Wave Accounting.
Ok but struggles on iPad Pro. What the app does it does well but it doesn’t do payroll as well as some other features.  Logging in to the website on my iPad Pro isn’t much better.
Great app!. Awesome tool for your business. If you don’t have a background in basic accounting principals, get a bookkeeper to help you set it up. A great Chart of Accounts will make the reports super useful.
Too expensive. I do to want to pay for s subscription , I just want to buy the software
More like slowbooks. I have liked QB for years but this is my first week using the app. Finding it very glitchy when doing invoices on the run. It often comes up with an error code whilst raising an invoice. You then exit the app, re-enter and check whether invoice raised - none to be seen. Then try and raise invoice (sometimes multiple times because the error code keeps reappearing) and next day like magic 2 - 3 of the same invoice are there! It’s probably the most important function for the app so perhaps something to be rectified QB!
Quickbooks a real sage beater!. Having been a sage customer for over 15 years I wish I had discovered quick books sooner, why did I spend all that money on yearly updates when I didn’t need too. I absolutely would recommend quickbooks to everyone and I do! Thanks for a great product guys 👍🏻
QuickBooks. Quickbooks has been absolutely amazing overall. Main issue is customer service and their ability to provide customer support for the app. I was required to ph 3 different numbers, one being out of service. Once I finally spoke to csr he was extremely friendly but did state they haven’t been provided proper training to assist with app related issues but would do his best to help. I would upgrade to 4 or 5 stars if they provide a user friendly option for support.
"Negative stock entry. I have been using this app from 5 days.. please make a provision of not issuing invoice when the stock is 0.. 

Plus while entering the purchase bill give a column of itemised discount in the items"
Check Payment Image. I wish if I can take of the customer check payment image and with in it on the app. Both of them times it’s hard to search for invoice number and when customers overpay the system does not stop them and the refund process is so difficult.
Terrible customer service. Customer service is a complete joke, I rang up the number for helpline on the app (which was one of two help options) only for the guy to talk for five minutes then tell me he couldn’t help me because I am self employed. I thought QuickBooks was aimed at self employed individuals and if you can’t phone up for help why on earth is there a phone number suggested while I am signed into my account looking for help? Useless, subscription cancelled.
Great App. Huge Bug. I just lost 2 hours of work from switching between my email and QB iPhone. Multitasking =  Screen goes blurry then you lose everything!!!!  In my case 3 pages of invoice.  If you are going to have catastrophic bugs like this then you need some kind of auto backup.  Love the app but this is the third time this has happened to me, literally flushing hours and hours down the toilet.  Makes the app completely useless to me. How am I supposed to access my times and pertinent info to propagate the invoice?
Give me a refund. I hate this app it’s trash an I want my money back !!!
Greatest app ever. I love the “Capture Receipt” feature. Makes life a whole lot easier.
"Big disappointment, terrible customer service. Almost impossible to import data easily , customer service techs 
Have no knowledge of the product and how it works. They only refer you to self help articles .  The QuickBooks apps don’t really seem to work with each other. 
I’ve downloaded several versions to see which one works best and neither of them will allow me to import data from quickbooks apps.... time to go back to the drawing board, and perhaps have customer service people who have used the software !!! And aren’t just trying to refer you to a DIY article."
Google sign-in never works. I have tried and tried to get into the QuickBooks app using the Google sign-in. I get it to work maybe 1 out of every 50 times I try to login. I don't know why they haven't fixed this issue yet. I always end up logging in on my mobile browser instead. Fail
Fix these two issues and I’ll be happy. Overall I am pleased with the app. I have QuickBooks online for my desktop and use the app when in the field taking and fulfilling orders. I have two issues with the app. First, there is no “credit memo” feature on the app. The desktop version has it. Some of my customers require separate receipts for incoming and outgoing products. I have to login to the desktop version to print a credit memo. Further more, if an employee did he would have access to company banking, personal info, etc. That’s not acceptable. Secondly, screen becomes blurred fairly often for all three of us on each of our phones. All functions of the app are locked up when this happens. You must exit completely out of the app and then pull the app back up for it to work properly. Fix these two items and you’ll get more stars.
You can do better, Intuit. This app has a lot of promise: utilize the power of an iPadPro and really speed up routine accounting functions on QBO. In reality, the app is glitchy, limited in ways it shouldn’t be, and effectively too flawed to use. I’ve been disappointed before by Intuit, but this failure is inexplicable.
Couldn’t get past sign up!. I downloaded the app and started the “free-trial” setup. It asked for my business name, then my country/region. When I tapped to enter Country/region, it gave no options. It was blank and did not bring up keyboard for manual entry. So I can’t even use it.
Excellent. Excellent app
"We love the QB App. One of the most useful things we have “out in the field” is our QB App that allows us to do bookkeeping by extension. Probably the craziest place yet was checking QB from the Pyramids of Giza in Egypt.
It’s extremely convenient."
"Needs improvement. I am a contractor and past for most expenses either by cash or my personal credit card. The app insists on setting up a bank account or a credit card!! Why can I just not book against the directors current account I don’t know.
Secondly when I entertain clients I habitually write the names of who I have been entertaining on the back of the receipt. I was half expecting that I would be able to scan the reverse side but NO the photo app only allows a snap of one side of the receipt"
"Have to improve in customer support. An ok app for small business.. but HORRIBLE customer service.. 
First starters, you have to call them ONLY during pacific time hours..? So I’m in Delaware, which means, if I want to reach them i have to wait to get a live rep. 
Then, their wait time is terrible.. 30+ minutes. ???
So one star for now.. Once you guys improve in this area, I’ll be glad to recommend and change rating..."
"Improvements. 1) stock quantity should be displayed in the app
2) round off amount space in invoice"
"Buggier and more expensive than ever. Don’t believe the five star reviews. Intuit has somehow been able to monopolize bank feeds in order to force us to use its second rate software. This app is the slowest and buggiest app on my phone, but also the most expensive. 

The latest bug is that you can’t change the date when you enter transactions. It only records today’s date. It’s been like this for about three weeks now, just as they announced big price hikes because of all the “improvements” they’ve made. These people really have a lot of nerve."
Expenses off. Expenses are off. It’s showing expenses from an inactive account on the app. It’s correct on the website, so it’s definitely an issue with the app. I checked and the settings are the same. Both should be displaying expenses for this month. Also customer service was terrible. Not one person was able to help and after five days of contacting one new person after another I finally unsubscribed. You should be able to assist a new customer immediately if you want to keep them long term.
Keeps crashing. App doesn’t work . No updates in months
No Activity?. None of my Vendors have any activity (transactions) available within this app.  Almost rendering it completely useless in our business.
This app is worthless. Literally none of the things I routinely do with QuickBooks is possible with this app.
"Improve your customer service. The program it’s self is easy to use, but if you need to call the customer service you have to request it by logging on and email/text  or the other problem is they don’t speak English well. 

With increasing prices they should have great customer service just saying!"
"Useless. Can’t share the online app with my accountant. Frustrating and USELESS!!!!

I got an email back from the development team. Thanks for the response but the review stands. You have an App that represents itself as QB Online. It does not say that it has severe limitations to the browser based version of QB Online. Further, there are no help files that tell you what functionality is NOT included in the App version. So.... Yes, you can accomplish a task but not in the App ... which defeats the entire purpose of having an App other than some marketing, talking head said you needed one so some half hearted attempt was made at providing one. Congratulations! You frustrated your user and made your marketing department wonder why they are losing market share to other providers. I develop software too. If I made apps like yours, I’d be out of a job."
Sales tax issues. The sales tax portion on this App has been broken and extremely frustrating to use for quite some time. I have been in contact with customer support a lot. In the end, after much wasted time with them I am always told they are aware of the problems and are working hard to resolve. 1 year later same problem exists. If you use this App in multiple areas with different sales tax rates - stay away as it will only cause problems! And QB will not make it right!
Love it, but needs some work. Reeeallly wish I could cut a PO on the app. Other than that, the app is a great tool
Wonderful App. This is a great way to keep books. Thank you.
RNM Media and Sound. It’s a great App and system. Lovely to use and easy to get around. They must just add online reception and receiving of payments. This will make business much much easier.
Doesn’t let you do self assessment tax. This app only does my business tax return, and whilst it doesn’t explicitly promise more, because it doesn’t let me do my self assessment (buy to let) it means I still need another app to do this. And an account on top. Being such a major tax app, the fact it can’t deal with all my tax matters is a MAJOR fail.
Smooth app. Love it and would never switch.
No access to payroll. The app seems to have a menu for everything EXCEPT payroll. I find these types of oversights all over QuickBooks online- glaringly obvious features that are incomprehensibly missing and customer service has no answers. Don't waste your time.
"Still needs work. One thing needed I’d making it easier to change customers info when doing a new invoice for a previous customer but at a new address.

I have many customers that own many places and I need to be able to put the address in for each place where the work is done with that same customer and the app doesn’t allow this to happen."
Way too limited. I can’t even use the app to see if a bill was processed. It only allows you to view check or ach transactions and deposits. Checks processed through bill pay don resigister as activity.
The worst customer service ever. Don’t waist your time. Trust my word
Nice app but I’d like to access the inventory. When you are out and making an invoice it is very important to be able to check the inventory
"Lots of Great Features, a few pains. While in general I like Quickbooks here are my major gripes:
1) BIG DEAL - intuit payments will make deposits before the payment clears your customer’s bank and then if it bounces they take it back without warning. This means that you see the money in your account, mentally check it off and then it disappears with very little notification. Just wait until my customer payment clears to pay me. 
2) No “New Bill” feature in mobile app. I need to keep track of who I owe money and when I get an invoice in the field I should be able to enter that as a bill to be paid later"
Expenses off. Expenses are off. It’s showing expenses from an inactive account on the app. It’s correct on the website, so it’s definitely an issue with the app. I checked and the settings are the same. Both should be displaying expenses for this month.
"Affordable Truck repair inc.. Great app,

Makes it very easy for us to keep track of our books."
WATCH OUT!. These apps are a scam. First, there is no free trial as there is no way to cancel the trial before the first 30 days. Second, they refuse to cancel accounts. Third, they infringe the law about data protection. Fourth, you’ll receive an auto reply saying that they have never heard of your case when you send them emails. Without any mention in my email of the word ‘case’ or ‘case number’, how does auto reply know I am emailing about a case? This is their care and support email that I have received one reply on already prior to these auto replies This tells me that my email address has been entered on their system to divert to auto reply. If I don’t get my data erased, my account cancelled, or if they take any money from my account, this will go to court!
Pretty good!!. Just started my business and so far liking what I’m seeing. The app is pretty neat.
"Cancelar assinatura. Fiz uma pergunta sobre cancelar assinatura e responderam algo na com nada. Será que vocês podem responder como cancelo a assinatura, pois não utilizarei o app? 
Aguardo um retorno 
Obrigado"
QuickBooks online. I really like the app, but it is very pricey.
"Really wanted to love this app. Everything appears to be top-notch, and still you actually start clicking around and trying to work with your data.

Example: I just deposited a check on the road. It was for an invoice. I went in to my refreshed account, clicked on the invoice, and attempted to market as “paid.“ A recurring error keeps popping up, every single time I try this, saying it won’t work. (“ ‘go to the help section“it says, which of course is no help at all)

I really wanted to love this app because golly it is slick looking."
Great app, prepare to be spammed. I keep getting marketing emails even though I unsubscribed from all. I’m going to have to find an alternative
It’s just okay.. I would love to say I love the app. We use both desktop and the app, and unfortunately the app somehow deletes payments made to invoices when applied.  They just are not there when I have clearly applied the payment days ago and now it says customer is overdue and has not paid.  This makes things very confusing and is not good for the service based business owner who is not at a desktop during the day. I’m kind of regretting purchasing quickbooks for our business all together. Our books have been a mess and we’ve had to hire a bookkeeper just to clean them up.
Disappointing App. You can’t really do anything productive in this application. It’s extremely limited in functionality.
Useless for sure. QBO is useless. Can’t login with Google account. Forces me to create a new/separate password. Can’t really access QBO via a browser on iPad. Overall terrible experience. I’m sure it’s equally Apple and QBO fault.
Amazing in App and on line. The perfect accounting platform.  Easy to use, fast and simple.
Movement through fields. I love the app but it takes so much more time than through Safari, enter or tab should move through fields looking forward to this fix
Trina Gordon (Happee Momentz). Great app! My business couldn’t function without it!
"Left hand doesn't know the right. When I switch from logging in online to the iPad or iPhone, the app doesn't seem to be updated with the new information. Case in point, my credit card was hacked so I had to update my account info on all my subscriptions that used that number. I received a notice form qb that my account was suspended. Apparently it isn't possible to update the subscription info from the app, so I did it online. Now when I open the app it still says my account is suspended. One of many glitches that exist between the app and the online experience. Needs to be streamlined! Every other app just re-ran the billing info and automatically updated to the CC replacement number. All QB is able to do is create frustration and berate the customer by suspending his account. 

Also requires too many clicks to achieve objectives. Frequently crashes when trying to import a customer."
I wanted to like it. But..... I didn’t appreciate the daily phone calls asking if I needed help .... I just wanted an app that would let me do my own thing and not feel harassed
"Keep crashing. After last update june 12 2019 keep crashing. New update came just an hour ago still same crash???!!!Doesn’t launch the app. 
Please fix asap pleasseeee"
"Incredibily Bad Customer Service. I would not recommend QuickBooks to anyone.  I have experiences extremely bad customer service.  Despite providing to them that I have paid my subscription, and showing them evidence that the renewal of the subscription is valid until mid June, they are still not convinced and are refusing to activate my service.

I am going to provide a negative review every day until I get a result.  Appaling service.  Ive never experienced anything this bad in my life.  For weeks now I am unable to invoice my clients.

I do not recommend QuickBooks.  Avoid them.

Glen Walters."
Doesn’t work. I have an iPhone 8 and all of a sudden this app stops working. I call QuickBooks and they can’t fix it. They closed the case in one day. Don’t walk away from this company, run away.
Needs more bank options. This app doesn’t support my bank (becu) si in that case it’s worthless to me. Please refund my money thank you!
App is crashing.... Had to key in a credit card thru the computer because the app keeps crashing and doesn’t let you charge a card.  Will change my review after they fix the issue.
Update ruined app. Since the last update you cannot run credit cards on the app. It crashes immediately when you attempt to. My business uses QB on 25 devices. All crash when taking payments. This has caused a massive issue for us and clients. Beware of putting too many eggs in the basket of a company that can be sloppy with the interface they sell you.
App crashes constantly. I used to love this app. The last couple of months the app crashes daily and multiple times. I’m in the middle of working and the app says critical updates are needed and logs me out. I’m extremely frustrated with this considering I pay over $20/month to use this software across all my devices. No resolution or contact from customer service. It happens almost weekly. What a nightmare. Looking for alternatives.
"Very Limited... QuickBooks is one of the best accounting tools out there...

However this app is very limited.

iPad is a very powerful device. But this app doesn't take advantage of that. Things like: 
* auto save invoices to the files app
* option to choose payment type
* when you paste an email from the email apps, it doesn't recognize those emails..
* Option to add company stamp and seal to the invoices"
"Dear devs/ mgmt : Receipt Scan needs work. Have identified at least these so far:

1 - automatically snap the photo once the borders of the receipt have been delineated by the software (like every other app of its kind since forever). Or create a toggle for auto/ manual (see app recommendation below).

2 - in Crop mode make the borders themselves draggable, not just the corners (makes it easier to maintain perspective/ prevent warping; see app recommendation below).

3 - add automatic image enhancement you can undo (broken record, see below).

Put devs with ownership of this feature onto looking at the dozen well-executed receipt scan apps out there, and emulate. In my humble opinion Scannable by Evernote has the strongest UX/ best productivity, though it is not accounting-specific. Suggest emulating this minimalist approach (which you are already doing): all the number crunching happens elsewhere within the Quickbooks app already. Scanner is a pure scanner and that’s it, not an expense categorizer, note taker, etc. Focus, make it the best scanner it can be with no muddying of that mission. Could consider an integration with Evernote/ licensing (“Powered by Evernote”). I am sure millions of users are using both to handle their business paper. Cross-promote, form strategic alliance.

Hope this helps. Will update this review upon implementation."
"Keep crashing. After last update keep crashing. New update came just an hour ago still same crash???!!!Doesn’t launch the app. 
Please fix asap pleasseeee"
"Still unsuitable for Chartered Accountants. This used to be a superb IPhone app. Then Quickbooks removed the functionality for accountants to inspect their clients’ profit and loss accounts and balance sheets within the app. The IPhone app developed other errors included restricted functionality when switching between our clients within the app. 
Here is what happened earlier this year when I complained about Quickbooks in a public space such as here in the AppStore, or on Trustpilot. Firstly Quickbooks tried to kill the problem with kindness writing to me publicly to make it look like they were addressing the problem. Secondly they then emailed privately, but deployed their non-English speaking staff who failed to understand the problem. Thirdly when they eventually realised the seriousness of the problem they deployed the correct people who then promised to rectify the problem within a series of timescales, all of which were extended time after time. Eventually the problem remained unaddressed and the specialist staff became uncontactable probably through embarrassment at their various failures to solve the issues. I have email after email after email after email proving all this, promising that these serious problems would be rectified. My conclusion remains the Quickbooks iPhone App is potentially a great product, but if you are a Chartered Accountant currently wanting to use this app to help your clients, FORGET IT. Look at Sage or Xero."
Liars. They lie about the app and what u can do with it.  Run away fast.
Handy for sole trader. Some things aren’t available on the app, like editing your invoices.
"Keep crashing. After last update keep crashing. New update came just an hour ago still same crash???!!!Doesn’t launch the app
Please fix asap"
"We must overturn the Quickbooks monopoly!. Apple has Quickbooks featured in a “Streamline Your Business” section. Laughable. 

Quickbooks is a nightmare of interface, usability, and pricing. Yet the accountant lock-in assures its continued existence. 

Take pricing, for example. With the desktop versions, one can have multiple companies, something many small businesses do for legal reasons. Quickbooks online? Forget it. You’ll need an actual separate subscription for EACH COMPANY! Truly ridiculous. Why not just enable multi-company support for companies registered to the same email?

This is just one tiny example of the lack of attention to design and price gouging of which Intuit is famous. 

Fortunately, there are more and more viable alternatives. Use the Google, Luke. 

Tell your account that they are just going to have to deal with whatever accounting software you choose. If they are a Quickbooks only shop, find another accountant."
Used for many years but. Intuit is increasing the price of Quickbooks by 25% the next billing period. The app doesn’t support key functions that you can access online, for example adding multiple email addresses to one invoice.
Great app. I wish there was a way we could charge credit cards that are already on file
Keeps crashing. I am on an iPhone 6S and running the most recent iOS.  Every time I try to accept my transactions in my bank account, I get through a few then the app shuts down.
Don’t bother if you don’t have an accounting degree. This app is terrible.  It doesn’t allow me to do anything that I need to day to day and then I have to go back at the end of the month and redo almost everything I have done for the month.  Waste of money and time.  An excel spreadsheet is more accurate.
Predatory data collection. The app wouldn’t allow me to accept payment without my giving it geo location. WHY DO YOU NEED IT, other than to use it in ways completely unrelated to my bookkeeping?  The app was already near useless. Good bye QB app!
Ripoff price increase. As of 7/1/19 the new Quickbooks Online price will be $70/month. Considering the lack of functionality of the app. and the bugs that never get fixed on the desktop clients, I would recommend going back to the desktop version. Let’s see....the desktop QBooks Premier version can be used and supported for 3 years at a discounted cost of $350-400. The online version will cost you $2520 for 3 years. You decide whether you want to reward Intuit for the bait and switch approach of luring you away from the desktop version and then clobbering you with price increases from $30 to $50 and now $70 for the online semi-functional version.
Tooooo good app for business. Good to make business easy
"Super easy. Great app and accounts program -  easy to use after a small amount of training. 
So far I haven’t come across any of those annoying bugs you get in other accounts apps"
App does not work. I have been unable to see my profits and loss on the app for months now and often the app does not let me log in.  I get constant errors.  I have spent hours with tech support on the phone all they say is “it’s a known bug”.  They have not been able to tell me for months when will the app work again.
Few useful features for me. Most of the main features I need aren’t in the app. Lots of features I never use are in the app. No bill payment, no upcoming bills showing up in checking register like it does on mine. No credit memos.
"Need some updates please. The APP is good fir me and easy to use ..
I would like to insert in settings options to automatically change the color of the invoices every 15 -20 days .let say when the invoice goes 15 days old to automatically change in YELLOW ,then when is 30 days ORANGE ,45days old RED and on and on and on :) ;)"
App crashes after each action. I use the desktop version most of the time but when I need to use it when away, it’s really frustrating that the app shuts after every action making doing anything painfully cumbersome.
Keep getting stuck. This is the first time I am using this app and in keep getting stuck after every two, three transactions
"Unusable on IPad Pro. Was intending to transfer all of my business computing over to my more than capable IPad Pro. Intuit seems to have other ideas. 
Unable to run my business with the QuickBooks software with the app or through the browser. 
A very unsatisfactory situation having my computing need dictated by intuit.
Will change software as soon as practical."
in-app purchase, but not stated in advance. RT
Great potential but.... The app has a great potential to replace the web version. However i do not understand why most of the features aren't in the app. I can't attach a PDF file to an invoice!! Why? .. or I cant send an statement with the app.. why not ? .. why cant add company seal and stamp on the invoices ? iPad is a very capable device.. the app should bring all the features of the online version.
"Annoyed again!!. I did the latest update and now I can’t even open this damm app! Terrific ay! Any suggestions QB’s!? Can you get this sorted ASAP.

A few updates prior to this lasted one, after that particular update all my company details except my ABN disappeared, why? The app didn’t seem to save my details properly as I added them and it was like that until the following update. Then everything was back to normal.

Pretty annoying!!"
Doesn’t work. App won’t open and website is unresponsive.  Not very impressed with the program.
So easy. Thank fou for this easy and convenient app to keep our business streamlined!
Pretty Pointless. I have used QuickBooks desktop for almost 20 years.  At one small company I work for, I use QB Online.  I feel that the app that goes with QBO is useless.  There is very little that you can actually do through the app and even reporting is limited.  And forget trying to change anything that was previously entered.  I would use QBO through the website on my iPad but that is not configured well either so I pretty much have to wait until I get to my laptop.  Don’t bother with this app.
Useless app. Takes forever or even never to load
Useless. Why even bother with this app? I can enter a bill from a sub or supplier on the website or the Mac app but can only enter paid expenses here? I can do everything I need to do with my business on my iPhone  without carrying an iPad or MacBook Air except use the QuickBooks app to enter or actually pay bills (only able to record bills already entered as paid). Please fix this (or just tell us you’re not fixing it) !!!
"STILL missing obvious features. - Need to add a new time entry? Nope! (Subscribe to another app, monthly, and hope it syncs properly!)
- Need to create a purchase order? Nope! (Wait until you can get back to the fat-app!)
- Need to look up unit cost on one of your products? Nope! (Why would you need that away from your desk?!)

So very typical of Intuit: 
- Good for accountants, terrible for entrepreneurs
- Build for Windows first, then anything non-Apple next, and *maybe* Apple last. But be sure it’s crippled in at least 87 ways.
- You’re holding it wrong

Oh, and don’t you love the new QBO “Advanced” that we auto-upgraded you to without your permission? It’s only 3x what you were paying before, and only after the first 90 days; aren’t you excited?! 

IT’S FRIGGIN’ 2019! WHY HAS NO ONE DISRUPTED THIS RIDICULOUS COMPANY OUT OF BUSINESS?!"
"Pretty good. It’s works on all my devices except, not equally... Not being able to run payroll from any app is annoying, I can’t send receipts from my iPhone, but can with the iPad? Why even allow me to hit send a receipt from my phone if the send button is always grayed out? 🤷🏼‍♂️
QBO does a lot for my business but having to have a laptop, phone, and iPad with me just to use the program is frustrating sometimes, sometimes like just before I wrote this review... haha."
Completely Useless. I have no idea how this app has a 4.7. You cant even edit transactions within this app. The worst part is that the website is completely broken on an iPad Pro. Together this makes quick books online completely unusable without a laptop. Absolute garbage.
Keep having to un-in/re-install. I keep having to uninstall app then reinstall because it gives me a black screen, then closes out. This is the 2nd time I’ve had to do this and it appears it may be a bug of sorts. Overall happy with the app but please fix this glitch.
"A long way to go and terrible support. I use the app as my chosen QB solution, I had added customer logos and always attached my receipts. I have been having problems to edit my phone number within the app and was advised to uninstall/ reinstall by QB support. In doing so I have lost all my attachments from the app, they are online but do not sync back to the app. Highly frustrating as I’ve lost one of the key visual features particularly on my expenses.

The support from the original issue has been going on months and now this one a couple weeks but they never offer a real working solution."
Where is the cost of the app?. Where is the cost of the app.  You gave me all kind of information but not the price of the app!!???
Critical simple feature still missing - for years!. Please add the ability to print or download packing slips from the mobile app.  Everything else can wait till I am back in the office.  Sometimes a packing slip must be done in a rush.  Mobile app is useless to me without the packing slip feature.
Slow books. Can’t accept transactions in banking section. Sluggish app, end up using the computer more often.
Customer files. Sometimes all the estimates and invoices don’t show up in the customers file when I go into it on the app.
Limited features. I’m not sure why QuickBooks decided to create an app that is so much different than the web version or the Mac version. Errors and limited information is all this thing is good for. And, if you decide you would rather just use the website, you pretty much get redirected to this junky app.
Small Business Asset. Easy way to keep track off all those expenses, invoices, payments etc for a small business owner with little time to spend on administrative stuff.
Easy here, hard there. You can tell this is more for business that need to create invoices more than purchase orders. Desktop as well. I’ll give 4 stars when they add a PO feature to the app.
Better than the others but still need to work. When it’s working it’s working great. I’ve tried a couple different systems and QuickBooks is by far the best with invoicing and estimates and excepting payments which is why the rating goes as high as four stars but it often crashes because I think it tries to do too much. Also there is no way to change when the system starts counting days past due. You can set it for net 15 net 30 or whatever but it will start counting from when you create the invoice not when you send it. For me I create an invoice on Monday and continue to add through it throughout the week and I send it on Friday so by that point it already says it is past due five days so I have to set it as net 15 just to not make it scream at me
Buggy app. Doesn’t even open, tried many times opening it on my IPhone X for weeks. It doesn’t even open the app and there hasn’t been an update to fix that for ages. Unable to use it on my phone and having to use it on my laptop which I don’t always have it on hand. Please fix this issue.
Scam!. This app won’t let you unsubscribe. Forgot my password and tried all ways to access my account, but they won’t send me a verification code in my phone. I have exhausted all efforts to change my password and log in, but to no success. I reached out to their failure of a customer service representative, didn’t help either! Scam!
Not ready for prime time. I’m huge QuickBooks fan, but not for this version! What a time destroyer! After downloading the app and adding my content along with driving and really enjoying the mile aspect of this, it failed me after just 3 days! What a waste of time. Unless you have unlimited time to waste and money to spend, I suggest staying away from this app for now! Perhaps they can get it together but I’m giving 2 thumbs down... oh and they don’t even offer phone support so don’t expect any help answering questions as it relates to this buggy software. STAY AWAY!!
"Falta información. Deberían dar acceso a inventario. Aún que sea sin los reportes, para dar una mejor experiencia al usuario  y enamorarlo más
De app"
"Needs improvement. I just started using this app while traveling. It doesn’t compare to the site on my PC. Very unfriendly and difficult to impossible to bring up to date.much incomplete data.

Need to go to work on this one of its to be useful."
iPhone 7. iOS 12.2. The app was okay with its limits. But now it won’t even open my company profile.
"Great app if it worked.. This app was really promising at first, but now it seems like I consistently have issues with chase bank accounts and AMERICAN Express accounts updating.  It’s Monday and sine Thursday my alchase accounts say they are updated when they are not and my AMEX continuously has error connections.  And then u call customer service and they ask you if YOU called AMEX to see why there was a connection problem.  

A shame."
"Terrible. So many problems I don’t even know where to start.  I transferred my desktop version to online with the last year and half reconciled.   I know have to go back and reconcile AGAIN.  

Also - it keeps crashing.  

There are good things about it but overall not so happy with the software."
Great App. QuickBooks has changed the way we do business. As a small business, such tools are so vital for the day to day running of your business. QuickBooks has truly been a revelation for us at Blink Mode Recording Studio.
Fantastic app for my iPad Pro!. I recently acquired an iPad Pro to use for my business and instantly downloaded QuickBooks to use on the go. This app has been wonderful for sending invoices, logging my expenses, and managing the books in general. So far, I have yet to experience a crash and everything has been working well for my needs!
"Great app but still buggy. This is a great app and has lots of functionality which is awesome. I can see my day to day company accounting actually being easy using this however I can’t actually accept bank transactions to reconcile an expense for example. Big shame as it’s a great thing to do when stuck somewhere with just my phone and the functionality is clearly there, it just doesn’t work for me for some reason. It works fine in my browser and support have been great in assuring me that it’s being looked at but it’s making me think twice about committing to QuickBooks after my trial ends. Fingers crossed for an app update soon to fix it.
*UPDATE* This issue has been resolved with the latest version and the support team were really good throughout. Extra star because of this! Thanks developers."
Zero stars. It really surprises me that a big company like intuit/quickbooks couldn’t come up with something that worked. The app is almost completely useless. I installed it, tried to do some basic stuff on it and couldn’t so I deleted it. Please intuit you have to have someone that can build you a better app!!
Intuit is quick to take your money, but somehow doesn’t have the ability to cancel your account. I signed up for my business, never got around to using it.  I finally decided to cancel the account.  I had to call customer service because after an hour trying to figure it out I learned there is no way to cancel on the app.  On the call customer service “doesn’t have the tools” to cancel the account either.  I was sent to the website through safari to find out that there is no way to cancel or delete the account there either.  Thankfully the account was suspended according to the customer service representative eventually it will just disappear.  Great, that’s the best they can do.
Created a mess of my bookkeeping!. I realized the feature that is supposed to “match” my manually entered transactions to those synced from my bank account has not been working properly. This has created a mess of my books due to duplicate entries of sales receipts and expenses. Quickbooks had one of their engineers investigate my issue and concluded it was indeed, a glitch in their system. I was advised to go back and manually re-enter my transactions. No small feat as I will have to spend considerable time and effort backtracking and attempting to rectify each entry dating back to mid-2018! They also indicated they could not reimburse my monthly payments for the service as Apple is a third party to whom monthly payments are made. So now I get to call Apple and try to facilitate a refund. The issue remains unresolved. Quickbooks’ best recommendation was to download the newest version slated to go live several weeks after my initial call to customer service. I can not operate my business this way.
"Half way. All I really want is something I can scan in my receipts with. They say they have this feature but they don’t. Even the free wave accounting app has this feature and now I’m left wondering what the point of paying for this service is with an alternative such as wave.. 

Not looking like I’ll be bothering to continue after this free trial if they can’t compete with a free alternative

Otherwise quite functional."
No place for attachments. When I first opened the app I was so excited.  I have been a quick book user for years and now everything is available at a touch from my iPad.  But the only thing that was missing was a place to put attachments from the banking screen.  So bummed hope this gets an update with the attachment feature.
Inexplicably no timesheet support in app. The most obviously missing feature is time sheet support. The support team is also quite useless and closes cases without resolving them or providing any assistance.
Less than useless. This app does not interface enough of the information from the desktop version. Reports are raw numbers and can’t pull up any supporting information.  P&L is worthless. The desktop version seems to miss the point of accounting software. Ie making all your information easy to input then easy to analyze in reports. This does neither.   QBPro etc was far easier to Navigate without the slick graphics and colors. Aaaaaargh!
Stock. The app doesn’t show stock levels under the products tab ! Need this feature ASAP
Some problems. Quickbooks online is great. That is, on my desktop computer.  I have had reliability issues with the software on both of my IPhone X phones.  The software needs to be updated to fix this serious problem.  I have been loyal to qb for 6 years and paid them thousands of dollars.  I expect the software to work.  Just today, I visited a customer’s property and they asked if I had the estimate-Much to my embarrassment the software would not load.  This has happened numerous times now.  This is unrelated to connectivity as WiFi has not solved the problem.  I hope QuickBooks gets this solved within days.
horrible photo receipt capture function. The recent update apparently changed the algorithm for identifying receipt paper boundary in a photo that makes no sense at all. Two out of three times it only capture a useless fragment of the whole receipt which the makes entering receipts a horrible and utterly frustrating experience.
Great except one thing.. I like everything except when the app times out while I’m trying to save an invoice that took me 5 minutes to write up!! And no when it does that it doesn’t save the invoice. Other than that it’s good.
"Fantastic software !. Currently in a middle of a building site, sending clients invoice & estimates. Now my time is my own this evening !
Couldn’t do with out it ."
More harmonisation needed.. I find myself, more often than not, logging in to the desktop version. Bank updates are very “hit and miss” particularly early morning.
Great app but still buggy. This is a great app and has lots of functionality which is awesome. I can see my day to day company accounting actually being easy using this however I can’t actually accept bank transactions to reconcile an expense for example. Big shame as it’s a great thing to do when stuck somewhere with just my phone and the functionality is clearly there, it just doesn’t work for me for some reason. It works fine in my browser and support have been great in assuring me that it’s being looked at but it’s making me think twice about committing to QuickBooks after my trial ends. Fingers crossed for an app update soon to fix it.
Great app but .... I use this app frequently while I’m not at my computer but am disappointed that I can’t access my suppliers & update supplier bills etc, will you be able to add this feature?
Missing Key Functionality. Whoever designed this app clearly isn’t a user or a business owner.  It is mostly useless.  I need to be able to view invoices and sort them by invoice number and the app doesn’t allow it.  I also just tried to process a payment for a customer with a credit card on file and the app didn’t give the option to do that.  So I have to wait until I get back to the office later today to do that.  Creating an invoice is so clunky, it’s ridiculous.  Logging in through Safari on my iPad Pro is even less useful. The website doesn’t allow me to scroll up or down or slide the invoice view left or right so that I can see all the fields.  So essentially, I can only see the first four invoices and that’s it.  QuickBooks needs to get their S***t together.
Great app. This app is great and it supports an even greater cloud-based accounting programme, I wish I had started to use it sooner. It is making my life so much easier.
Useless app. Can’t issue a PO, pull one up via search, properly send one, etc. Core business function that they didn’t bother to include because intuit continues to have their head stuck in the sand.
"Long way to go. This app has long way to go, if you truly wants people to work from every where, then make this app work just like web logins works.

On Apple iPad Pro 11 inch, even I login via chrome, use request desktop version option enabled, screen flow do not work properly, its a mess, Firefox is up to date, but says update Firefox, safari has the same problem not showing screen properly. Screen responses are some times too slow, to the point you cannot work from it.

App has problems of its own, even though its showing at the time of login that fetching data, but still old data, I have to force refresh it after screen is loaded.

Direct Debut functionality do not work in app, cannot select while creating a new invoice.

I will make a change to invoice, save it & when I come back to it, changes will not be saved, its totally unreliable.

Tested XERO app on IPAD Pro, works like a charm, QB sort it or loose us."
Tonya Pitchford. App and product are useless for my particular business. Very hard to deal with, fees are high
"Not useable in multi-user environment. STILL A ONE STAR.  Years later - update, after update, after update and still can’t use this in a multi-user environment.  Locations and Classes. How many effing times do I have to ask to get this fixed?

Here we go again, another update and still no fix to Locations and Classes.  Intuit must be the worst software company on the planet.

So in April Intuit ""reaches out"" that a fix is on the way.  That was 5 months ago!  I stand behind my criticism.

Still a 1 star.  What is wrong with Intuit programmers?

Yup, yet again another update, and still not useable in multi-user.  My business has more than 1 user account.  Locations and Classes do not work in their accounts.  How many years will this take to fix a bug that has been present since day 1?

Another update and I stand behind my previous review(s).

Seriously? Another update, and still not multi-user friendly.  But, oh boy, something works with Apple Watch.  When will Intuit fix the multi-user issues?  Someone else mentions they fix bugs.  I can say the exact opposite - they leave bugs for years!

I want to use and like this app. I've looked at every update since the very 1st version.  It does seem to be slowly improving, but is still not useable for my company."
Sales tax. Cannot use the app on my phone because it does not calculate sales tax correctly. Spoke with customer service. They know the issue and do not seem to think it’s important to fix it. Makes the app almost useless to me
Packing slip. Please add option to print packing slip from the app
Meh, no project profitability reports in the app. As a construction business all our accounting revolves around P&L reports per project. The online/desktop app gives us the project report but the app does not, which makes the app pretty much useless. Our best solution is to login to our qbo account through safari on the phone to see the real time project profitability, shouldn’t the app do that?
"Can not use. I’m from iran 
I can’t use this app
Because iran not in country list 
Please add iran to the country list"
Very disappointed. There is very little you can actually do with the app.. Not impressed am canceling the account.
Amazing. Amazing app I use it for my online business
"Incomparable with iPad Pro. This app works terrible with iPad Pro. Basically made this business expense a complete waste as the app and web program useless on the iPad Pro. 
Extremely disappointed and frustrated."
Bad customer service. Worked for a month then disconnected from my bank, so email sent, didn’t get a reply for 2 days!!!! Emailed again another 3 days later I get a reply, problem with bank couldn’t be sorted so I downloaded Xero, absolute pleasure to use.DONT USE QUICKBOOKS!!!!!!!!
Electrical contractor. We really like this app and all its features. It’s fairly easy. I gave it 4 stars only because it is missing one important feature and that’s appointments. It would be one less app I have to download into my tablet and computer. It’s just a suggestion that would be so convenient all in one( hint hint).
Nice app... wish it did all I need it to do. I have told people, do not buy an iPad with the intention of running QBO on it, you will be surely disappointed! The app doesn’t do enough, especially in reports and you can’t run payroll... and in the browser it’s TERRIBLE.
Errors Galore and inability to log into client accounts. I’m so disappointed with this app. As an accountant it would be handy to log into client accounts and check figures or enter small changes, but more often than not, I receive an error message and cannot log in. The issue renders this app completely useless.
"Addicted to BILLING now!!!. Oh my goodness.    This app is no joke.   Love it and I stay up late looking at all it has to offer and new things.   

I’m glad I got this and the Card reader.
Thanks QB"
"Great but needs some updates. Just recently I am unable to log in to my company. I can get on to my online account, but not on the app??
Says my email and password isn’t found?"
App problems. App keeps crashing haven’t been able to create invoices for days
Good app if you want to manually import your bank transactions. I previously have QBself employed and everything was fine. Bank accounts would sync up. So I decided to get QB online for check printing capabilities. I started QB online beginning of Feb 2019 and immediately became aware that my bank was not on QB online list of banks, but it was in the list of QB self employed banks ... weird right...? So I contact CS and they said they will make a escalated ticket and this matter should be resolved with 3-5 business days. Well it’s almost 30 days later and bank account are not synced and have not heard from anyone from QB online. So I just recently contacted them again in chat support and they tell me that I need to contact my bank to see if they made some kind of change that would not allow me to connect. So in all reality they were never working on my ticket because if they were it seems they would have notified me to let me know that is what needed to be done. PS also ordered a card reader about 2 months and still have not received ANYTHING!!
For last month since major online update its is useless. When I login it tells me I don’t have a subscription. I call support they tell me to uninstall the app and reinstall. After reinstall the login works but you cannot switch between your companies. I called them back. They said no one else is reporting this.  Three users in MY OFFIVR are having the same problem. I love the iPhone app for entering receipts on the go but I can’t even do that now.
"Buggy and still no way to easily back up data. This is a buggy app that needs to be closed and restarted often, even though it’s the most expensive app on my phone. 

Believe it or not in order to back up your data you need a Windows 7 computer with (out of date and insecure) Internet Explorer 11 or earlier. 

Come on guys, fix this app!"
App is crap. The quickbooks app very rarely lets us sign in and when it does many of the functions do not work. I’ve contacted customer service which is a complete joke. Their suggestion was to check out the message board to see who else may have the problem we have! Why? How about fix the problem!
"A lesson in poor user design.. This review is not about QuickBook's design regarding the recording and posting of entries. QuickBook's is deserving of this one-star review because of the terrible experience I had today with their customer service and subscription processing that snowballed into a 2-hour ordeal. I want to preface by saying I had the pleasure of meeting a few lead UX designers for TurboTax so I was actually biased FOR QuickBooks prior to this.

My free trial expires in two days and I had planned the whole time to pay, I just procrastinated on doing so. Today, however, I attempted to log-on and was greeted with a ""trial has expired"" message. 1) this happened 2 days before my trial period ended 2) I couldn't LOG IN TO PAY because my trial expired. I later discovered this was because I initially set-up the account on iOS, but there was no message to indicate this to me at the time, and I was forced to wallow in my frustrations. 

After repeated attempts to log in I was able to get into my QB online account when I accessed the site through my history.(not sure how that worked but that’s not the point here.) I finally get in and hit the “subscribe now” button and enter my payment information. I get a “something’s wrong, please re-enter your payment information.” So I do so. And I do it again. Still nothing. I switch to my credit card. Still nada. I then tried to go into settings and access the subscription tab but it wasn’t there, which after some googling I discovered was probably because I opened the account on the iOS app. Figured this was also why it wasn’t accepting my payment information.

ALL of this trouble just to PAY for the service. But don’t worry, it didn’t end there. 

So my iTunes account is attached to my family payment method, which I don’t want paying for QuickBooks. I would like to pay for my accounting app with my business account—makes sense right? Well, you HAVE to pay through iTunes if you open your account on iOS. So I get support on the line and “message an agent,” meticulously explaining my issue. We go back and forth and he tells me that I have to contact iTunes if I’m having trouble changing my payment method(not what the problem was). From the message you can tell he really doesn’t understand at all what I’m saying, and he was frustrated by that and was rude because of it. I tell him that I would not like to change my iTunes payment, that I’m trying not to pay through iTunes because I want to use my business account. He leaves me on read. Wonderful. So instead I ask support for a callback.

A very kind lady takes my case and after spending quite a bit of time trying to figure out what to do she’s about to walk me through what she thinks is a solution when my WiFi goes out, so I told her I’d have to call back. And that’s where I am now. Point: I spent nearly 2 hours trying to just PAY for a subscription. Absolutely ridiculous.

1)Trial ended early
2)Couldn’t log into account to pay
2.5)Didn’t tell me to try my iOS app
3)Just let me mindlessly enter my payment information without telling me that it was never going to work because I have to pay through iTunes 
4)Nobody at QuickBooks thought that a business owner wouldn’t want to pay through their iTunes account?
5)Disappearing subscription tab without an explanation other than in the forums
6)A rude, confused, and unhelpful customer service agent"
No GST only take !!!!!. Why is this an option the the web based but not the app. Makes the app useless!!!!!!!!!
Great app. Only thing I don’t like is if you accidentally delete an invoice you can never get that invoice number back and it’s now been voided. That needs to be fixed so it can be adjusted or recovered. None the less it’s a great app. Won’t ever connect my bank info none the less because that’s how you get audited for nothing.
Good app if you want to manually import your bank transactions. I previously have QBself employed and everything was fine. Bank accounts would sync up. So I decided to get QB online for check printing capabilities.

Hope this can be added. Would love to be able to put payments to employees on the mobile app which we do often
"Almost Usless. The app does not show all the info like logging in from a PC. Also scrolling up or down on a page is very glitchy. 

QuickBooks has a lot of work to do on making this app useful."
Critical update!. I was just in the middle of a really long material list and a notification came up that there were critical updates to the app. Clicked on ok.... lost everything! Not impressed. There was no option to ignore or update later. According to the app update description it was just minor bug fixes etc, etc.
Inconvenient. When I first got this app, I was able to link it to my bank account to track expensases versus spending. It worked for a while and at some point disconnected. I’ve tried numerous times to link it back up but nothing works. FYI I use an iPad Pro. When I called we were on the phone forever for them to come to the conclusion that I need a desktop computer for it to work. After that they were not willing to help. Aside from that, it constantly logs me out as I’m using it. Not worth the $20 a month to do basic bookkeeping.
Self employment. Great app
How do I remove this app from my IPhone?. I do not want to use thus app and now I cannot uninstall it from my IPhone.  l try by holding the icon and get a message asking if I want to share it. Does not show in my settings so I cannot delete it there either. Can't find online help.
Cant update billing info in app. Slow, awkward layout, intelligent prefill of categories usually incorrect slowing down workflow. Will be using moyob to set up accounts for my next fy.
DO NOT BUY. While I think this could be a good product, the app ruins it. I have both the base and the arm. THE APP CRASHES EVERY TIME I USE THEM. At times it takes 3 tries to get them to finish reading. Terrible product!
Low Rating Until the App Supports Chart of Accounts. The app continues to be undeveloped for functions that are developed in the web interface. The app is excellent for invoices and credit card transactions if you have a merchant account coupled to your QBO account. The camera can be used in app to document your receipts to the cloud and I use it extensively for hotel/airfare/rental car expenses and they can be attached to invoices when emailing your customers.
"Useless App. Intuit has an app called SelfEmployed which is $4.99/mo and has more functionality than this one. It’s mind boggling. I can’t use that one because I need a Chart of Accounts so I got this one thinking. ’Same company so this app will have that functionality and more because its 10x more expensive.’

Wrong.

Here’s what I wish someone has told me: You can’t even manage an AmEx account on this app. As all my expenses go on my AMEX Business card, this app is literally useless. It shows you the balance. That’s IT. You have to do manage the expenses on a desktop computer. You CAN manage your AmEx expenses in Self Employed. Makes no sense.

You like the email receipt match-up functionality in Self Employed? Pretty nifty, right? Well you can’t do it in this app either.

This company is the absolute worst. It has — for two years in a row — told customers the online banking feature was going to be shut off on the desktop version forcing you to pay for upgrades. The $200 upgrade lasted a year before they told you that version was ALSO going to have the online banking functionality turned off. 

Intuit is a greedy company that makes buggy, mediocre software. They rely on the fact that they have the corner on the market. As soon as I can I’m jumping ship. I have a feeling I’m not the only one who feels this way, either."
App doesn’t recognize credentials. This app worked well for me until the most recent update. Now I cant login, says can’t find the account with this email/password. This is very annoying since I travel frequently without a laptop. Now I’ve lost the ability to access my accounts via the app.
Missing Tons of Company Data. I have no idea how this app has such a high review. I’ve been using QB online for years and installed the app to work remotely. A HUGE portion of my transactions and customer files are not accessible from the app. They either won’t load or simply do not exist on the app. Upon contacting customer support I was told, “sorry but the app is a bit glitchy and we don’t foresee a fix anytime soon.” QB Online advertises itself as a remote solution for bookkeeping, but it is impossible to run a business without being able to access all company files.
"Great app!!!!!. Great app for your business. 
Really makes things easier and proactive. 
It also tracks everything"
"Hoodwinked. We moved from QB Desktop to QB Online.  The process resulted in lost data and an inability to pull accurate reports.  After hours on the phone with support, the technicians agreed that there were problems with their coding on the back end of their Online service, which prevents certain data from being pulled into reports properly.

To make matters worse, without notice, QB Online has introduced QB Advanced Subscription — a more expensive product.  In doing so, it has limited the number of accounts and classes permitted in QB Premium, meaning that our Company, which has more than 50 classes and more than 250 accounts, will no longer be able to use our current subscription and will be FORCED to upgrade to an expensive QB Advanced.  

And, as if that’s not bad enough, I discovered this by going to my Company Settings, where I saw a notice that this forced upgrade would occur in exactly ONE MONTH.  So, without receiving any notice, and out of pure luck, I stumbled upon the fact that they are holding my data hostage. 

AND, Intuit doesn’t want you to use desktop anymore because they can get more money out of your subscription than they can from the one time sale of desktop software. The result?  They have created ways to upload your data, but not to easy download the data. In fact, you have to go through MANY hoops to download your comprehensive data, during which you are bound to lose information. 

Time to look at other accounting software by companies who actually care about their customers."
"Unusable. Doesn’t connect to my account.. Every time I try to login it says there is no company associated with my account. It works fine through a mobile browser or desktop browser.
The app is completely unusable, how convenient.
Tech support says there is a glitch...you don’t say."
Horrible app even if subscribing!. Subscribe to the app yet they want me to pay for a new subscription, waste of money for months!
"From bad to worse. Going downhill fast, the app version is very restricted.
Also the price is getting higher, they entice you in with a low start price that then increases once you are locked in.
Scared to leave as I am unsure what data I will loose"
iPhone X and iPad Pro App CRASHING/NO LOGIN. The app has had intermittent issues where it logs you out every once in a while causing you to close the app, re-login and you were okay for a day or so and it would do it again.  NOW IT DOESN’T WORK AT ALL.  I cannot remote login to my QBO account from an iOS device.  THE WHOLE REASON I went with QB Online 7 years ago was to get access whenever and wherever I needed to of my business.  Currently running a $4M business on your app and now looking at alternatives to move the business too.  This has been an issue for NINE MONTHS NOW.  Get it fixed!!!!
Unable to login via iphone/iPad. Every time I try and login from my iPhone or iPad it tells me no account associated with the given information. But when I login via a web browser with the exact same information I have no problem. Basically defeating the purpose of the app. Fix ASAP please
App can’t find our data. We are days into this app not being able to access our data:  accounting, banking, billing. Access is only available through certain browsers on a laptop/desktop. The support team is friendly and wished me luck.
GAME CHANGER. Been using the desktop version for over a decade.  Now that I’m using QBO along with the mobile app I feel like I have been living in the dark ages!  This is simple, useful, powerful and most importantly convenient!  No more keeping up with paper receipts and forgetting to keep track of purchases.
"Great App - Shame about the price. Used this for almost 2 years now but need to find an alternative following a 70% price increase. 

It’s a shame, and it’s causing hassle for me in setting up my records with another accounting app but the only way we can object to such massive price changes is to cancel and leave."
Crashing. I’ve had constant trouble with this app crashing on me off and on for months. Now it doesn’t work at all, even after I deleted the app and redownloaded it. No one can help me.
App has low functionality. Quickbook rocks but the app has very limited functionality leaving it as something not helpful to review reports
App is not functional. The app is keep crushing on IPhone XS max every time you I want to create new invoice. Billion dollar company but cannot fix bugs for a few months already, its embarrassing.
"Fair app version, but not good as browser version. I’m not able to select item groups when creating an invoice.

Also Im not able to enter SKU when creating an item.

Neither Im able to search items by SKU info...

They dont let you set a fixed price for an item group on any version of the software which O find really easy to implement by code which is dumb..."
Pathetic on iPad. I don’t know why Intuit bother to have an iPad app.  It never works, has less functionality than a browser. The latest update tells you your account doesnt exist, the exact same log in as a browser. Someone in the development department is being paid far too much for a substandard product.  Avoid the app like the plague
Timed out....... Worked for 2 hours on typing big estimate, session TIMED OUT, lost everything, how is this able to happen? We send people to the moon in 1969 yet we can’t safeguard/prevent this app from wasting hard work and precious time. It’s the first time I thought I could throw my iPad into the next county. FIX THIS STUPIDITY
"Terrible package. I’ll be cancelling your app and the account I had with you for two years after finding out you’ve doubled my monthly subscription without any notice what so ever, I agree with an inflation rise yearly but a100% rise is just robbery, I’ll make sure this goes far and wide. The damn app never works , can’t connect my bank and it shuts down several times a day for critical updates.
Back to sage for me I think this system is full of issues"
Terrible app. Keeps crashing. Keeps dumping you out telling you that “critical updates “ and must login again. Try to login and - am a very long-time customer - it tells you your company is non-existent. Ba humbug. Complain to Intuit and they say use a “supported” device. In other words: DON’T USE THE APP.   Time to find software other than quick books.
When it works it’s great. This app will not recognize my credentials even as I use the online version. I wish it were reliable and I was able to use it consistently. Even reinstalling the app does not fix the problem. Intuit needs to focus on making this app work on a regular basis as you pay for this service.
Doesn’t load (for me). App doesn’t load. Tap on the icon and nothing happens. I hope no one else has this problem.
App crashes constantly. I used to love this app. The last couple of months the app crashes daily and multiple times. I’m in the middle of working and the app says critical updates are needed and logs me out. I’m extremely frustrated with this considering I pay over $20/month to use this software across all my devices.
"Crashing and signing out. Hi there 
This app continuously crashes saying it needs crucial updates. There are no updates and continues to do the same over and over again. 
I cannot use it at all now. 
Help."
Signing out.... Ugh this app keeps signing me out in the middle of my work.. please fix this soon. 😞
Can’t Generate PO’s. 90% of my business is generating and sending PO’s which you can’t do with this app for some stupid reason. I’ve been requesting the feature for years (which I shouldn’t have to request) and Quickbooks has never responded.
Crashes constantly every time I try to use it!. Crashes multiple times every time that I try to use the app! On line works fine. The app keeps freezing saying saying critical updates needed! But I already updated app and deleted the app and reinstalled it.  I tried everything I could do.  So frustrating! Older versions worked well. This is on an iPhone XMax. Newest phone .., latest version ... not working!!
"QBO app. Useless app,  does not present a desirable layout compared to the the online version, in the Banking area,  to the bank register.
Somewhat comparable to using another account program."
QuickBooks Mobile App Crashes Continuously, UNUSABLE. The QuickBooks Mobile App Crashes Continuously and is totally Unusable In it’s current condition on iPad. Frustrating and we are planning to switch accounting app companies, after years with QuickBooks program. Intuit seems unconcerned with fixing the problem that has been plaguing our record-keeping for weeks now.
"They don’t care. The product is decent but the customer support is very bad 
The say that the priority is the customer lol. I have a issues with uploading my inventory list and it’s bean now day 16 with no resolve... the funny thing about this issues is it’s on there server and they know about it. I created a new trial on an other server and the up load works fine. If there priority was customer service they would merge my data to a other server and I would be a happy customer .... but instead they leave me hanging."
Rubbish. Absolutely rubbish since the last update . Keeps crashing on iPhone XR. screen message = app needs to Close due to critical updates. Happens 20-30 x times a day when trying to set up an invoice /estimate etc. TEST your updates before release you them, you idiots!
Hate it. Accounting manually with a ledger would be quicker than this program. I officially hate this program and will be changing to another accounting software in July. I have been using quickbooks since 2000 and used to love its simplicity but it has become time consuming and harder to use. Make a mistake...can't fix it. If you are away you can't access all the features using the app - you have to find a computer and log on. App is garbage and pay run screen won't scroll so you can't edit anything like hours worked, for example. Reckon looks like a really good alternative. Maybe quickbooks should have consulted keychain when they developed the app. If you thinking of quickbooks for your business...DON'T DO IT! Every employee  of quickbooks must have given this a 5 star review.
"Add Purchase Orders to App!. Absolutely Wonderful
EXCEPT! 
1. Pls pls pls add Purchase orders to the app, as it’s not ‘on the go’ for me without it. 
I have to whip out my laptop for every order to process the purchase orders or wait until I get to the office. It limits my sales not to mention the fraustration.

2. For South Africa, I also need the ‘Projects’ tab. To file all invoices and purchases under a specific projects.
I noticed this feature is available overseas, but not for South Africa."
"Useless. I have used QB online for many years, and I’m very happy with it. The app is useless to me though, since the interface is way too limited. For example, one good use for it would be to enter receipts on the fly, but much to my disappointment I couldn’t do something as simple as to pull up a list of accounts to assign the cost to. Entering receipts would be a perfect use for a mobile app, but I simply can’t do it correctly. I mean, what did Intuit really think it was going to be used for?

Also, the payment methods I have set up in QB online are not available in the app, all you see is credit, check or cash. It seems like the app doesn’t synch fully with your online info, which makes you wonder what kind of mess it can create in your bookkeeping. Strangely enough, when I started the app it said that it was synching with my data, but it appears that this was just the basic data and none of my personal account settings.

It’s entirely possible that I have missed some of the finer details, but they really messed up the app by making the interface so different from the computer based online version. Having to learn and keep up with two versions is just too cumbersome for a small business owner like me, so this app is now deleted. Calling it a bookkeeping app is grossly misleading, since it’s so limited."
“Critical Updates”. Face ID does not work.  Every time I try it tells me there are critical updates and I need to log in again.  There are no updates, and it tells me this every single time.
"Great, but can learn from others. Just my observations:
Mobile app should be mostly used to record expenses. It lacks OCR tracing. Moreover scanning a receipt is a multi-step process. Should add force-touch to add receipt (open in camera).

Invoices: been searching how to add my banking information. Cannot believe QuickBooks does not allow for adding banking information to invoices. Did I miss something? Or is it a hidden feature? Not very intuit-ive (pun intended). Otherwise good. Like the integration with Bank account."
Signed out. Every time I launch the app I have been signed out due to critical updates. I sign back in and before I can even pull up an invoice I have been signed out again. If I switch to another app and switch back I am signed out again. Sometimes when I switch back into the app I’m left with a blurred screen and have to force close the app and relaunch which AGAIN signs me out. This is getting ridiculous and hurting my work flow extremely. The Mac OS app isn’t any better either.
Content. I am a young entrepreneur who has a background in Mechanical Engineer with a focus on manufacturing and product development. So when I decided to strike out on my own it was along these lines. I have tried several other software packages and they never seemed to fit the needs of my young dynamic company. Obviously what kept me from going QB right off the bat was cost. However, the integration with numerous other platforms and companies always was appealing to me. Then when my accountant made the suggestion to switch to QB she had a very good point. QB is about the only reliable and cost effective software that would handle the more complex project and multi-level customer account strategy that was necessary for me to implement. So I switched. I am happy overall. There are minor details that are infuriating, but for the broad spectrum of technicalities that I face this software blows all others out of the water. That is coming from someone who is very adept at programming in excel and could easily automate all that I need to accounting wise with time. Time being the key word there... Why reinvent the wheel?
"I can’t do payroll from the app. It works great and is much improved from the original versions but I do not have a desktop/laptop pc........ only iPads and android phones and the apps limits my access way to much 
I currently use the chrome browser but it’s horrible only part of the screen is visible on the iPad some save buttons can not be accessed 

Thanks for your help"
WASTE OF TIME AND SLOW. I didn’t even get past the registration. The app was soo slow and laggy when I was trying to put my details in I gave up. Couldn’t imagine the amount of time I’d waste trying to write up quotes or invoices on it. AVOID!!!
Constantly signs me out.. It’s infuriating. Just leave me signed in!!!!!! Even worse sometimes as soon as I sign in it says “please log out and log in again” this app is BS
Signed out automatically. Every time I launch the app it signs me out and I have to log in over and over. Please fix this issue. It is annoying.
This App is Getting Worse. With each update this app gets worse than the last. In the last two iterations, if you open the app and login and open a document such as an unpaid invoice select out of the app for any reason and come back to the app it forces a logout telling you “there are critical updates” requiring a new login. The only cure (temporarily) is to delete the app and reinstall. Now the latest update appears to have fixed this but now App Feedback is broken with “This application didn’t configure UserVoice properly” error. All these bugs and we still can’t inspect or create purchase orders in the app.
It Can Take A Long Time To Get Fix to Major Issues. Presently the APP (possibly incompatible is an iOS update) stopped allowing me to login. It recognizes I have entered the right credentials, then it force-logs me out in favor of an app update. Then it will not let me log back in. It says it cannot find the company. This has been going on for two weeks. I have to delete the app, reinstall it, re-enter my credentials. It will work, but just the one time. That is messed up!
HORRIBLE. Please update this app so it stops crashing during every use!!!  Also, critical updates every time you try and do anything????  Getting old and frustrating. FIX IT!!!!!  Also, why when you update a transaction, it saves it from before the update, so you are doing the work twice???
The app always logs me out!. The application is great don’t get me wrong. But it always logs me out every time I log in and it says “Please Log In to refresh. There are critical updates to the app.” But I am already logged in! It very annoying having to log back out and then back in every time I use the app which is everyday since I need to monitor my business on the go! PLEASE FIX THIS ASAP! Not satisfied with this at all!!!!
Keeps crashing. For the most part, the apps work pretty well. However, for whatever reason the app on my iPhone crashes every time I login the first time. It gives me an error saying critical error please sign out. Most the time when I sign back it, it’s ok after that. But usually requires restarting the app.
"Can’t create multiple companies. Can’t create multiple companies or entities with this program.
I would have to pay a subscription fee for each company.
If I wanted to track my individual expense, my business expenses, and my LLC Expenses I would be stuck for $720 a year when the 2013 version on my laptop could create unlimited companies and only cost $300 paid in full."
Logs out every time - please fix this!!. For the last few weeks every time I login it says there are critical updates and I need to log out and back in. Every time. Nothing changes or updates. Very frustrating.
Mobile glitches... Love using QuickBooks but I run my business out of town where we are not able to have WiFi other than mobile hotspot. Using the QuickBooks mobile has been convenient but also a P.I.T.A... Glitches, closes on its own, logs me out, and sometimes doesn’t save invoices/estimates. Has been like this for a while and haven’t had any changes..
Am I doing something wrong???. How does this app have a near 5 star rating? It is THE most glitchy app I may have possibly ever used, ever!! You switch from the app to something else, it says it needs to restart. Then it restarts but doesn’t work because it says my email is invalid. The only way to get this darn thing to work is completely close it and restart/resign in, EVERY SINGLE TIME. I’m trying to create invoices with information from texts and I have to switch back and forth form one thing to the other - you can imagine my frustration when it makes me restart every single time!! Ugh. Not a good app.
"“Updates”. Every time I go to do something the app says it has to log me out to run updates.

Getting sick of typing my password constantly. (Literally 100% of the time I try and use the app.)

Pretty much just use the website these days."
Latest version is a disaster. Face recognition does not work at all. You have to sign in every time you open the app and often get kicked out especially when switching between companies. Colossal waste of time.
No American Express support. We use American Express for expenses and we cannot manage these transactions within the app. Not even see them. The app tells me to view QuickBooks Online in a web browser to manage AMEX transactions. This makes this app very useless.
It’s having to log in constantly. I’ve been having a really problem with my iPad six generation lately, anytime I exit the app while writing up a quote and bounce back-and-forth between the information I need to enter into QuickBooks. The app suffers a critical crash causing me to login several times with in an hour span. Are there any bug fixes coming up? I suffer the same issue with my iPhone XR and iPad Pro.
Scared. I added the app. Haven’t used it yet. I read some of the awful reviews. Decided to delete it. Not worth my valuable time. Don’t think it is necessary to go through the same nonsense everyone else has gone through. You may want to call it the power of reviews and lack of response from the people in charge.
"Junk - Plagued with issues. This is is great when it works, but is plagued with bugs.  As of recently it logs me out to “refresh,”  then when I log back it it tells me the account doesn’t exist. 

I fix this I have to delete the app and reinstall it, every, single, time.

And their customer service is terrible. They never have any solutions."
Bad customer service and bad app. I’m use only one month is the most terrible app. Never used this app
Logs me off all the time. Every single day this app automatically logs me out, displays a message that there’s been a critical update, and that I need to log in again.  Even worse it requires you to actually enter the password rather than allowing Face ID authentication.
Invoice reminder from App. I was hoping to manage my Quickbooks account on my iPad like how I use QKB on a laptop, but it seems like on the iPad version it’s missing a lot functionalities, such as invoice reminder to client. Also to set up the invoice reminder. Can you please improve this in your next update? Thanks.
Prettt good. It’s a good app, I’d have given it 5 stars but the sequential number doesn’t load when using the app. This means to produce an invoice you have to go back and look up the last invoice number.
Crashes and forced log outs.. So many glitches, slow and unresponsive. If you leave the app for even 30 seconds to find a number or email or something you need to add into an invoice, when you return to the app it will say there are vital updates and you need to log out and log back in, then 50% of the times this happens the app crashes right after you log in, forcing you to login all over again. Then you will need to navigate all the way to where you were trying to edit and start from scratch because none of your progress is saved. This has happened to me a dozen times.
"Gst number option not available. Add gst number option in the app.
Have to visit the browser and then update gst"
Awful, just awful. Doesn't even show Taxes or VAT, you have to log on with a desktop browser for that. Wish I’d signed up for another accounting app.
Very helpful business tool. Small construction business, I can do all my basic bookkeeping at lunch hour with this app
Poor experience. The app is extremely buggy, unstable, and very slow. Logging into the app is unpredictable and I'm randomly logged out. Entering receipts is quite painful to say the least, and is impossible without a decent internet connection.
Good if you use Quickbooks for limited functions. Lacks access to a lot of what exists in the full browser experience. Particularly frustrating that not only can you not create a PO, you cannot view them. Other simple stuff missing or not quite matched up as far as fields being available for adding products, suppliers, customers etc. In light of them increasing their monthly subscription fees, hopefully some money is going to be spent bringing feature parity to their access tools.
Used to be great, then they “improved” QB. I’ve used QuickBooks since the late 1990’s and was an early adopter of QuickBooks Online. While Intuit has improved the platform dramatically, the latest rounds of “improvements” that have made the mobile app entirely unstable and unusable combined with nearly doubling the price and a pricing model that is disconnected from business scale (one could pay the same for a small business with $50k in revenue and a not so small biz with $10m in revenue) has left me utterly disappointed and looking for alternatives. Problem is, switching is nearly impossible. So, if you’re considering QuickBooks, just don’t. Try Xero or any other other competitors out there. If Intuit can fix its most basic issues and start providing actual customer support that is accessible (just try the “app help” link which takes you to an Intuit help page with NO APP SUPPORT option!) with modern methods (like chat and email instead of only phone, and phone that can’t be reached most of the time - again, give it a try), then I’d recommend QuickBooks again. It’s a shame because there is so much that’s great about the platform... but when doubling the price for purported gesture enhancements results in app bloat and instability, avoid like your business depends on it, because it does!
Glitchy. Only problem is if you’re doing a live estimate or invoice, if your screen goes idle this app makes you log in again and you lose all the information you’ve typed in. Super annoying especially when you’re measuring out a house or doing a walk through with a client and entering information as you go.
"Hot garbage. Latest update to this piece of garbage app requires you to log in EVERY single time. Pathetic these guys can’t get it right. 

UPDATE 02-02-19; STILL has constant logout problems after all these years. Would give 0 stars if I could."
Okay. This app would be perfect if it didn’t redirects me to safari to login every single time
Great for self employed. This is great app if you are self employed or starting up by yourself.
Great app. This app has been a life saver for organizing my small business. I can track all of my finances as I go without worrying about carrying recipes and forgetting things. I highly recommend this to anyone is business.
Worst user experience. App is made of complex processes..i they are more focused on collecting data than providing service..uninstalled within 3 minutes
Very limited functionality. The app has very limited functionality - I can’t even see the purchase ledger on the app never mind post invoices or take photos of them. Lists supplier contact information only, not even account balances. Useless.  I have to log on to full site and try to navigate around it on phone screen which is difficult. Oh and by the way, very unhelpful customer service too!
So much support online... for other versions. I bought this product because their website showed all these articles to help you do this and that. After buying the product, I found none of the advice lines up with it (press the gear button...where exactly is that). Then you realise that all the advice is for quickbooks online, and not for this ‘quickbooks accountancy’. Yes there is an email questioning service, but you would think the advice would be available immediately. I have no desire of sending 30 emails as I try to grasp how to use this app.
Great app. Great mobile app. Only gripe is I wish they would integrate bill pay. Other than that, solid app.
So easy to use!. I love how easy the QuickBooks App is.  So helpful when running my business on the go!
"Requires : Raise PO to Supplier function. Missing few essential functions the app:

Ability to raise Purchase Orders to suppliers in the app: with ability to turn this feature on or off in app.

Link / Allocate Supplier Orders (purchases) to Sales back orders.

Flow Chart from Sales Po - Purchasing of stock against Sales Inv or Sales PO - and linking of Purchased shipments’ tracking info.

It would be good to be able to pull up the relationships between items clients orders of both sales and purchase and actual shipping info via tracking number and APi to view the flow of supply against sales orders etc. SAP has this ability (minus some of the features mentioned)

Allocating ordered stock (purchased) against Sales Orders to have a clear indication on how much of the ordered stock is pre-allocates and how much is extra stock for shelf.

Link with shipping programs by entering dimensions and weight and to book from with in or through APi.

That would make the program ACE!"
Does everything I need.. If I could see my outstanding bills on the dashboard, I would say it was perfect. But even though QB have chosen not to include this requested feature, I am still happy to recommend.
4 out of 5. Great app! The only feature I wish was on here was the ability to write purchase orders and revise them, as it’s not available on the mobile app. Other than that, it’s great!
Where’s the Progressive Billing option?. I was having the hardest time trying to find the progressive billing option on this app, I soon realized that the app may “just not have it”. I went to the website to find the option and create a progressive invoice, then went back to the app to apply the finishing touches. I bought an 11” iPad Pro to not have to use my computer anymore for things like this. So if any developer looking at this could add this very simple feature it would be very very helpful. Thank you! Also an undo button would be great :)!
Horrible App. You can’t add time activity.  This has to be the stupidest design I’ve ever seen.  You’re in the field and the most common use would be to add billable time.  I’m about to switch to another provided if they don’t get their act together.
Mobile vs desktop. I see no reason the same features can’t be provided in the mobile app as the desktop interface.
Great for attaching receipts, not for entering expenses. I love being able to take photos of invoices and receipts and directly attach them to the expense. However, I am unable to add expenses because the app does not have access to my accounts or categories. If there was even a save as a draft option, I would give this a 5/5.  However, I am not able to save any input if I can’t add the account or categories.
Great app so far. Great app. One thing needed I’d making it easier to change customers info when doing a new invoice for a previous customer but at a new address.
This is Awful. I use Intuit for taxes. I wanted to see if his app would offer something similar to a ledger. Instead, I was forced into a trial for a subscription that I don’t know how to cancel even after speaking to the intuit sales department. There are no explanations on their website or in the app.  Nor is there a direct button to opt out that I found.  I am not using it because it doesn’t provide what I’m looking for and the difficulty with opting out of the trial is more trouble than it’s worth.
Absolutely inconsistent. Probably the worst app I had on my phone. I have deleted it. It gives incorrect, inconsistent notifications. It’s completely useless to access certain parts of QBO. How incredibly unfortunate that intuit can’t build an app that can compare with the advances made in QBO.
Terrible support. Unclear subscription charges for payroll. Spent over an hour on the phone with poor English speaking support staff who could in the end only tell me they couldn’t help me with determining whether I was being charged for payroll services or not. Billing and signing up for services is very unclear. I clicked on payroll in the simple start online package to get price information and wound up getting signed up unintentionally. I spent an hour on the phone including a 30 minute wait with people who really could not access the needed information to tell me about the charges.  I’ve canceled my subscription, although it looks like my first chargers down the drain… There has got to be better services that next one.
President. I’m busy right now trying to invoice, from customer service to user friendly software QB is on point for the business man. Love the service for sure.
Updates. Need more updates on the apps because I always have to go to my laptop to do certain things not like in that
Totally useless. As a long time quickbooks user I thought this might be for me. After many frustrating hours trying to figure it out and the seeming absence of help I’m just going to delete it and cancel my subscription. As I said a total waste of time
Very well designed. Since the dawn of tablets I’ve been patiently waiting for tablets and apps to be able to handle larger programs.  Because of QuickBooks easy and convenient app.  I have converted my business to all IPads.  It has not only been an amazing tool for time management and popping out quick quotes.  But is a big reason into my cost savings going from expensive laptops to iPads.
Help. Hate trying to get help this way, but my app keeps crashing.  I love my online version, but basically I can’t do anything with the app.  Would make my life so much easier if I could
Recurring payments.. I really wish I could set up recurring payments from the app and also delete invoices
Limited Features. Good app but still too many features missing that require logging in to the website. e.g. VAT and paying salaries as expenses.
Works better on android phones. I had a android phone and tablet before and the programs works better than apple app and I say that because I change to apple and when I use the program on apple I am limited on what I can do when updating quotes and invoices I don’t have the option to add items or replace one that it already exists I can only remove that line the only way I can add something new is at the bottom line and I don’t want it there so for that I give it 3 other than that the program works fine but when you need that option to update with out having to redo everything from scratch or use a old quote as a template is a important factor fix it and I will give it 5 star
BMB. I cannot connect with my Canadian Credit Union.  Have been using app for several months now.  It is both good and bad.  I love that I can take my work with me to record with my IPad, but would like to be able to transfer transactions from QuickBooks Online to QuickBooks Pro 2014.
"GARY STANTON. This app means I can seem to know what I am doing, it actually works for me.

Still good!"
Just started with it.. Can I attach a file to an invoice that I create with the app?  I don’t see the option and we need to be able to do this or this app/program won’t work for us.
"Whyyy. Why on earth would any app ask dor my banking information and password etc
Theres an API for those
Theres absolutely no way for me to share my password with anyone or anything...
Zero stars"
All that you need at the same app. Great app, easy to navigate
Don’t bother downloading!. This app was so hard to use, wouldn’t connect to my bank, wasted so much time trying. Brought up all of my personal accounts transactions even though I asked it to hide them. Wouldn’t bring up transactions older than 3 months. I honestly don’t understand how anyone can use it!!!
"Overall pretty Good as an App👍. It can take awhile to get used to using QuickBooks – but it is pretty good once you get used to it.
Occasionally it can be a bit clunky and you don’t get all the functionality that you would expect.
But overall using it as an app is very good"
Fantastic App. Really easy to use. Saves me a lot of time as I can do my invoicing on the go. Make sure you sign up for QuickBooks online, not self employed, and then your accountant can use QuickBooks accountant to access your files.
Inventory. I would like to see quantity of my inventory on the app. Please make this happen.
Limited functionality. App doesn’t permit printing or downloading to a spreadsheet format. Makes it impossible to reconcile accounts or print statements for records retention. Very expensive with limited functionality.
Missing function. We need a mileage tracking function in this app, not only to self-employed version, to integrate all the expenses within Quickbooks.
"iOS impacts the rating. It is impossible to fathom that in 2019 I cannot view and/or pay sales tax on my iPad whether I use the QuickBooks app or via a web browser. And how is it that I cannot enter bills on my iPad? 

Given what Intuit charges for QBO and payroll, which we use, this is totally unacceptable."
No ability. I download the app and signed up, then I realized that I have to be self employed
Worth the Buy!!!!. QuickBooks Mobile has made estimates and invoicing so much easier! Definitely with the buy for any small business!
"Very poor development. I switched to online pension on MAC so I could work while I traveled.  Thus I also purchased an IPAD PRO to work from.
This app doesn’t show the check register, doesn’t divide my P & L into classes which I need. 

Signing in using a browser like chrome or Firefox or Safari doesn’t work either as it doesn’t provide the ability to scroll down the page.  I just spend 90 minutes online with support yesterday and they have no answers, let alone understand the problem.

Since switching from desktop to online I have spent approximately a weeks worth of time with support as they are not very knowledgeable and always have to put me on hold to talk to someone else.  

They have a lot of work to do on their programs before it is worthwhile to switch!!"
Nice app, but not worth it. I have run a small business for two years and used quickbooks the first year because I thought it was the right thing to do for taxes (and to not get in trouble with the IRS). After filing taxes the first year my accountant said that she thought Quickbooks was not necessary and kind of scammy on how they lure in new business owners. I then stopped using quickbooks and went solely with Google Sheets (online Excel). When I buy something, I print the invoice and add it in the spreadsheet. Much simpler, faster, and it’s free. While the app is nice, it’s way overpriced and too time consuming.
"The worst app and support ever. If I could give this minus stars I would. 
The app has multiple problems: 
Duplicating downloads from my bank account giving false balances.
Not recognising matches.
Losing transactions.
Camera rotates image by 90 degrees making it virtually  impossible to photograph receipts.
Slow and inadequate response from technical support.
The list goes on but I’m fed up typing now.
If you are considering this app my advice is: DON'T
If I had the time to change to another accounts packages that would upload the intuit data I would.
Any recommendations?"
Scope for Lots of Improvement. Given that this app has been out for many years, it seems like it has been neglected. The interface shows it. For example, if we touch a vendor, only the address shows up and nothing else. Ideally, all details related to the vendor have to be displayed - PO, Bills and Payments. Many such improvements can be done.
"A great concept but full of bugs and limitations.... I’ve had this app for almost 2 years now and I have to say, I am exceptionally disappointed in a company this large, producing a limited, buggy product...

I recently switched to a new business line but did not update the new phone # in QuickBooks online.  Now, I cannot login in online, I have tried but it wants to send a code to my old business line, which no longer exists... I called and spent an hour with quickbooks online and they couldn’t figure out how to reset my number; I am still unable to access the software online ( ironic, since it’s called “ quickbooks online”). The problem with this is that the iPad/ mobile platform software comes with many limitations, so the only was you can perform certain tasks is to login online.  

Next in line is the send invoice button.  You build your invoice, then send it by pressing the send invoice button; unfortunately the invoice does not always send and when it does, on occasion, it does not update properly in the mobile software.  I run my numbers tight and by the book and it’s extremely frustrating when you send off an invoice, it says it was sent, and the receiver actually never receives it. The solution is: A follow up call to every billed client to make sure they have received their invoice.

There is much more disappointment, but just not worth any more of my time to continue going on and on..

Conclusion: Find an online invoicing platform such as invoice 2go or something else other than this train wreck.  The amount of frustration and time consumption for such an inferior product at a premium price has no justification for an online/ mobile platform."
"Very beneficial app. This is a Very beneficial app.  It does not replace the PC version but is an excellent aid.  It's helpful to send invoices on the go or at the end of a service call.  

The sooner the customer gets invoice the more chance I have of getting paid. 

It is a very good aid!"
"Great app but Changes requested. Great app that really allows me to manage my business with ease. 

Changes requested within QuickBooks Intuit

-Contacts can not be deleted

-When creating estimates/invoices, I’d like to be able to re-arrange line items once they’ve been entered into the document.

-I wish mileages and receipt tracking could be used within this app because then I’d just attach all expenses to each job. 

-I’ve had trouble recently customizing the templates. When I make changes and try to save, my changes do not stay. 

-Occasionally the entire app will freeze and I’ll lose all in-progress information."
Online version and App don’t live up to desktop standard. I’ve been using the online version for about a year and have completely stopped using the app.  When I try to make an invoice it will error, but only after having built the entire invoice.  The online version is ok, and it’s nice to be able to access it from anywhere, but it does not live up to the standard of the old desktop app.  I was a big fan of QuickBooks when I used to use the desktop app.  Now I’m looking for alternatives.  The online version is overly expensive for small businesses and the prices seem to go up randomly.  I was on the $50 dollar plan and it went up to $60, so I cut back to the $10 plan and I just noticed I’m being billed $15.  I’ll be getting something new for 2019.
So many good things ... but. I loved that I could take a photo of my receipts and then just throw them away.  I like that it was in my phone and I could easily record real time so I didn’t have to go back and think what was that for?  My hope was that I could easily share this info with my book keeper who also uses quick books.   So I logged in on the computer so she could download the information. Unfortunately the product she uses is different and it changed my app and my account such that while the information and all the receipts are in my phone the are not on the computer and I have no easy way to print the out and the book keeper is going to update all the info by hand.  Five month of hand entering again every check and purpose of each purchase.  I talked to customer service for a long time.  His final advice was to delete the app and download it again.  I had just started to feel like I was getting a understanding of how my business was was going with this little app and then poof. Gone.  I will down load something else.
Excellent Program. We are extremely happy with this program, it has made our company administrators live so much easier.
Great app. I’ve been using this App for about  a week now so far it’s been great.
No employee section. This app contains nothing to help your employees, only the business manager. Quick books could’ve at least added support for timesheets and such since they no longer allow you to save your timesheet in mobile browsers.
Business Owner- Mechanical Contractor. QBO, has been the best program for my business.  I am really impressed with its capabilities, and have been a user for several years now.  I am currently trying to integrate every day work apps with QBO for a single Point of Origin business management software.
Easy to use. A very easy to use software that is cloud based with a great phone app. I’ve been using this for some time now and it evolves every year. Most for the best. A helpful help call centre should you have any problems. 4 stars as I don't believe you can back this up
"O melhor App. O melhor app para gestão empresarial
Simplesmente nunca usei algo parecido"
Professional.. This app helps me quickly and easily stay looking professional and on time with my invoices and government payments
Works well but can’t see inventory level in app. Would be helpful if I could check inventory levels without going to web, other than that pretty handy app
Totally awesome solution. Great and easy to use. Even the mobile app is awesome.
Too expensive now!!. Overall I’m happy with the app. The only thing is it has become waaaaay too expensive. Can hardly afford it anymore. Been exploring other options.
Not enough. Can’t do everything from app.  They say it’s better, but it can’t be if I can’t access everything I need, makes the app pointless.
Missing deductions!!. The MAIN reason I’d want to use the app is unfortunately not available in France- photographing any expense receipts I have and immediately entering in deductions when I make purchases. Until this part of the app isn’t migrated over to the French version, the app is almost totally worthless to me. So bummed. However 3 stars because the app runs smoothly in what it does, even if you can really only enter sales and receive payments.
USELESS APP. Used To a quickbooks user a couple of years ago, and it was ok then, but now I have recently returned and find it rubbish. A simple thing like adding a company address is turning out to be an impossible task. Total waste of my time. It you are a small business using the app via iPhone or iPad forget it. Stay away
App glitch. Other than the recent app glitch all is good.
Update needed ASAP. I also have been using this app for years (it’s greAt when working properly) but something happened after this last update and I’m getting kicked off and signed out in the middle of my invoices and estimates. It’s staying “an important update is required” or something like that and I’ll go to update the app but it’s already updated! And I’ll log back into the app and get kicked off again with the same message.....
Unhappy v18.12. As of version 18.2 I can no longer “Switch Company”. Looks like the developers broke a really great app.
BEWARE: App & the Company. I was recommended to get the QuickBooks App for a client who turned out to be a scammer. I sent the scammer an invoice and sent a trusted client an invoice the same day. QuickBooks quickly red flagged the scammers payment and requested that  I verify my trusted client. There is NO Customer Service for this App, email assistance only. When I finally got through to someone who could help me they assured me that my clients funds would be sent to my bank account. That was November 9. My client contacted her credit card company and was told that the QuickBooks had already received her funds and because I had rendered the service would not refund her account. Now I am told that I must wait until August 15, 2019 to receive the funds that my client paid me for my services rendered. This is a SCAM! I think that QuickBooks is sending this scam out BEWARE!
Forces login twice. App started logging out after I log in. Forcing another login. Worked great before that.
"Disappointed. Just updated to the latest version and This app is crashing all day I can’t even use it normally I need to log on 10 times to write one customer I can’t run my business normally like this please fix ASAP 
The app tells me you need to do critical updates. Idiot I juts updated the app and now it crashes ever time I open it"
"Another QuickBooks app. It gets super frustrating that you guys keep making us download a new app so you can start your reviews over.

Now your new app doesn’t recognize my account I have to sign in and out multiple times for it to actually load my data"
CIS. 3 stars given because I can barely use the app to submit CIS invoices as I have to use the webpage version which does not work very well at all on a mobile interface
Not very user friendly.. Not very user friendly. Have to open the app twice every time I use it. It says critical updates required log out and log in to refresh. Every. Single. Time. I . Open. The. App. I’ve tried deleting and reinstalling multiple times. When entering receipts it could have a search box at the top of vendor list do you don’t have to ask to search every time.
Slam dunk. QB online app is awesome for working from home
App as of lately. Every time - every single time - I open app, it tells me it must log out because it’s running critical updates. It worked fine until a week ago. Not sure if it’s related to Apple software but it’s getting old.
Limited and buggy. There are too many features not included to make the app any use.
"Crashes 48 times per day. App crashes over and over, saying you need to log in again for critical updates. There are no updates availability, and deleting and reinstalling the app doesn’t help. 

It’s frustrating because it takes 20 minutes to enter customer information, because you need to finish and hit that save button before the next crash. Best to just use quickbooks in the browser, even though that isn’t perfect. 

Four stars with no crashes."
New update crashes every time. New update makes me close and reopen every time for critical app updates
Happy but need a little help on a question. I like the app. I can’t seem to get the job address or shipping address to show up on the invoice... it s a big concern for me.
Desktop should be same as app. Great app but a shame that the desktop version dies not have the same functionality
Dead in the water here.. I have been using QB on line for a while now. There is still a lot of bugs that will drive you out of your skin, and nobody gives a dam. Today the app updated and now I can’t even get in. Waisted my entire evening reseting my password and still nothing. I have had it with QB!
"Inferior to QB Online on Desktop. QB app on iPad or Android does not not have even half of the features that QB Online has on a desktop. I can manage basic invoicing, basic expenses, see transactions, and pull up basic reports... Everything about this app is basic. I have to actually be on my desktop to access the full features of QB Online.

Very dissapointed."
Labor COST. The software has all the infrastructure for tracking labor cost to individual customers. Why can’t intuit enable it so the cost can be applied from weekly timesheets to the job cost of individual customers?
How come I cant make POs on the app?. This should have this ability built-in.
Great app. Awesome app for entrepreneur business.
Hate the app. Limited functionality of the app makes it virtually useless... Unless I have access to a pic or laptop, I can't do all the things I need to do.  The program itself is good, just not sure why the app hasn't caught up yet.
Amazing accounting software for SMBs. Great capabilities and integrations. Only downside is the iOS app is not always reflecting all data from the software. I believe this will be fixed soon
Waste of time. This isn’t even a functional version of QBO. I originally went to Safari to look at something on my iPad and the site suggested downloading this useless app. I did and was very excited at first to see a clean design and quick setup. That was quickly dashed when I discovered that you apparently can’t DO anything in the app. I can’t find invoices or bills, let alone enter new transactions. I search for transactions I know are there and the app doesn’t find them. Worthless. I’ll be recommending to our leadership team that we finally abandon this sinking ship known as Intuit once we get past year-end.
Great App. Overall its a great app. You can do many things from the app that you can do on the desktop version. I would like to be able to enter the worked hours on the app and also to be able register vendor invoices not only expenses.
Ability to do transfers. Good app just wish I could do transfers between my bank accounts the same as the online version.
"Disappointed. After everyone raving about this app, I decided to look into it. 
I was offered a discounted joining fee before I had even looked at it and  this was withdrawn if you did not take it there and then!
Having joined I thought it was okay but not for £10 a month. Looking online I found a six month deal for £3 per month and it had the features I was looking for. But, having enrolled the old account had to close; not a problem only the new account does not have an app/mobile feature. The opening spec said it did!
I like a product that does as it should for a good price. This is not that and is not fully transparent.
Shame."
"Excellent!. A great app. Easy to use and gives the features of the browser version on the phone. 

A small flaw: The + to add new things in, specifically on an iPhone X, sits a little too low meaning it’s under the home bar. It’s optimised nicely for an X, though!"
Great for invoicing out but that’s it. Was hoping this was the answer to our accounting. It’s quick and easy to send invoices and take pics of your receipts but when it comes to inputting invoices you receive from your suppliers it’s a huge let down!! Waste of time
need a guide. new user here and i need this apps for my business... but i wanna know how to entry my daily sales..
"App Issue’s. I purchased a new iPad Pro 12.9, I downloaded the quickbooks app. On the left tab when i would select sales it causes the app to crash.
I tried deleting the app and re-installing the app and it did the same thing."
Fee increase is a bad deal. Fees increased but same services rendered. Otherwise it’s a decent app. I’m disappointed that they get people to invest all there invoices and history in app and program then up the fees in them nearly double. Can’t trust a company that does that to ya.
CIS transactions. Cannot carry out CIS transactions in the app for some reason, you have to use the web version. This is really annoying and somewhat inconvenient. Other than that, a great app....
Poor. Very poor, looks good, loads not available via app, buggy things get repeated after purge, why there isn’t a test drive feature that  doesn’t perm add and clears when turned off is beyond me. Phone support terrible, tell them using app and answer is use web browser on a pc, why have an app if core functionality is unavailable. Pointless the self employed app is a bit better but no iPad app, it at least has ocr for receipts and auto cat’ing them. If it wasn’t for MTD being pushed in April then I would leave QB alone unti it is more mature
QBO and this app Two thumbs down.. How does such a large company make such a crappy product.  Basic logical steps can’t be completed.  You go to summit a improvement and tons of people have listed the same things and nothing ever gets fixed.  The app jumps back and forth between web view and app view. Support is horrible.  You can’t even move different parts of the invoice or estimate around in the app.  Switching to ZoHo
Bait and switch. I really enjoy the convenience of using this software on both my phone and computer as well as being able to allow access for the accountant who files our corporate tax.  The software itself I rate at 5/5 as well as the tech support whenever I have needed it. I have used quickbooks for years now.  I was however disappointed when quickbooks offered an incentive to recommend them to a friend but then did not follow thru with the offers once people signed up.  I was also disappointed that after a short time of them being signed up both their fees and mine nearly doubled!!  Bait and switch!  Should have kept my recommendation to myself and continued with my service as it had been for years I guess
Just need it to be reliable, that’s it. Simply just opening the app and signing in is more trouble than needed in some days. QB has everything I need already. I’d rather have bank connections, signing in, viewing basic info, and all the basics work flawlessly than anything else.
Still requires computer for cash management. This app is missing a critical feature to manage cash flow, a register screen. I don’t understand why it is so difficult to have this on a iPad. The running balance column does not show up in the app, safari, nor chrome. I tried to use another “desktop” browser and QuickBooks will not allow the use of other browsers on iPad. This forces the use of a desktop computer to see what your cash position is going to be next week or at the end of the month. I called support and they had no idea about how to support an iPad. Frustrating considering I spend over $500/Year between a couple companies.
Customer Support is Embarrassing. App itself is ok, Quickbooks itself is decent, but the customer support is simply there to pay lip service. They will promise you all deals under the sun to get you on board but then revoke them and deny all knowledge of offering you them in the first place... all of which comes a month or so after you’ve integrated all your accounts so they are tied up with them. Any time you ask them a query they give you some waffley response and it’s quicker to search and work out he answer yourself. Like I said, the product it ok, but the customer support is embarrassing and I wouldn’t trust the company as far as I can throw them.
"Where’s my PO’s.... Vendor Access is very limited.. Need to be able to access full Vendor info and functions. 
App falls short on the Vendor side."
Good program. Wish I could see if my estimates were “viewed”, like my invoices.
App fails to load on iPhone X. Failed to start in iPhone 6s and iPhone X
"Paying Vendor Bills within App is NOT ready for Prime Time. I’ve been using QB since 2005 and wanted to really like this app but it has too many bugs.  Using the app in the current form will lead to frustration and look forward to spending many hours on hold with Tech Support.

The online version works best from a desktop.

On an iPad or IPhone, the app has problems paying vendor bills or in obtaining bank data.  These problems also exist when using browsers like Chrome, Safari and Firefox.  

Not sure how widespread the banking problem is but by chance I was in a Starbucks trying to sync bank data using a iPhone and IPad and I gave up and as I was preparing to leave, I notice another person at the next table with the online version of QB open on her laptop.  I asked if she was having issues. She was also have bank synchronization problems with her bank which was a different bank than mine.  We were both on the phone with tech support at the same time for the same issue.  Tech Support believes it’s a bank problem but the bank says it’s not them.  

She also was frustrated with the time spent on hold with Tech Support.  

Stay with the desktop version for now."
Payslips via App. Can’t access the payslip’s by using app ??
"Application IOS. Bonjour,

Enfin l’application IOS 

A quand les prochaines mise à jour ?

1- Adresse d’expédition inexistant dans les factures et les devis ?

2- impossible accéder au facture qui se trouve dans les brouillons 

3- Impossible de rapprocher les opérations avec la banque en ligne 

4- Impossible de mettre des pièces jointe dans les factures et devis"
Nothing works for me. Nothing works for me with this app. If I login using desktop, QBO is OK but when I use the app, there is no information; no clients, no invoices, nothing. The subscription says I have a free trial until 2037. Phone support was unsuccessful.
"Très bonne application. J’utilise depuis plus d’un an la version web et j’attendais avec impatience la version « appli ». Je ne suis pas déçu!
L’interface est ergonomique et simple (c’est ce qui fait la force de Quickbooks).
Les fonctionnalités existantes sont un premier pilier mais il faudra dans un deuxième temps rapatrier les éléments de banque afin de permettre un monitoring de sa trésorerie et son activité.
Dans un troisième temps, l’ajout des fonctionnalités relatives aux coûts et factures fournisseurs sera un plus pour proposer la seule appli à gérer le flux entier des écritures comptables et permettre aux entrepreneurs de suivre leur activité.
Merci aux développeurs."
DO NOT USE MOBILE TO CREATE YOUR ACCOUNT. Lost all our data on our old account because apparently if you first sign up using iOS you absolutely cannot continue the subscription using your computer. Had to just make a new account. You also can’t access any of the profile from the computer once the subscription runs out so I wasn’t able to download and save any of the data either. DO NOT USE MOBILE TO CREATE YOR ACCOUNT.
"Sneaky subscription fees and invoicing not adequate. I never write reviews but this has bugged me. So I’d heard of QB once before and have seen them advertised as being useful for business owners and the self employed. I decided yesterday to download and give it ago. You’re greeted with a 30 day free trial and then once proceeding and setting up your account you are immediately pressured into buying a “40% discounted” subscription of £5.99 or face paying £9.99 per month forever. So I agreed to it assuming it would be a useful tool and that naturally like any other subscription company the charging period would begin following the 30 day free trial giving you breathing space to cancel if it wasn’t fit for purpose. Well this is not the case. As soon as you commit to the subscription it begins charging you and waived and free trial period! Sneaky and underhand move there.

Also - when actually trying the software I tried to add an invoice to my account that I had sent a client recently. It wouldn’t let me add any additional lines onto the invoice which meant I could only add one cost and notes section completely missing the point of being able to break down various different costs on the one same invoice, such as expenses/sales etc. How stupid. 

On top of this the advertising didn’t make it clear there are two separate apps (business and self employed) so after downloading the QuickBooks app and going through the above it turns out that one is just for Business use not Self Emp. Please amend the app title in the App Store.

I’ve got a refund from Apple for the above but this shouldn’t have to happen. Please leave your underhand tactics at the door and play it fair like any other subscription service."
Epic help. This App is very helpful for me it is very good
Very misleading. You can download the app for free and use it for free... For the thirty days 😡 Then you have to pay 11.49 a month? 🤬 that
"Only problem. I have a few problems 

The app is very slow when editing email address in the send invoice 

I don’t see a few things that I’d like - discounts for example 

No way to customize message to different customers 

Most of this is pretty minor 

Biggest issue is reconciliation of books at end of year"
So happy. Awesome app
"BAD choice. Desk top version is robust and an amazing tool for small business. This Mobile version is a toy. And not much fun at that. Paid invoices don’t tie to accounts, lag time is un acceptable. Trying to use infringe of a client is embarrassing. Very quick books pro class I’ve taken trying to correct what i was sure was a user error problem has resulted in the instructors telling me it was a mistake to enroll.
And now i cant even figure out how to cancel the bloody thing. Their step by step is out of date and useless.
$60 a month is absurd. And so far the customer service is a joke."
"Glad I made the change. We were using Xero for years purposely ignoring all its flaws cause hey, anything was better than going back to MYOB, though after a few frustrating years of not having basic functions on the app, no call centre for support (really??) and having to frantically search through countless 3rd party apps for simple features we finally gave up and honestly not looked back. 
We are now paying less than half in subscription fees, have all the functions we need built in on the web and on the app, and most importantly can speak to a human if we need help with anything. 
We can see that these guys are serious about improving their product and that’s why we had to give them a great review!

Thank you intuit for reducing our admin hours, we now spend the extra time focusing on our business and ourselves.  Cheers"
For what do you need my number?. Are you seriously? I have to make up an account with number? For what do you need this information? Why  u can’t make an app without stupid registration?
Cancel my subscription. I want to cancel my subscription ASAP.
Great App. Does cost money this app. It’s definitely worth it! The app keeps up to date
Terrible support. The feature that you promote in your advertisement for this app shows a person recording his receipts wich mainly are cash or card paid. The options that you have as type of payments are cheque, credit or other. Nobody this days pay by cheque or by credit receipts for small amounts!!!! Totally useless!!!
It is very easy to use. The app may not have the power or flexibility of the web client, or PC installed application, but it works well and is very easy to use.
"App does not support multi-currency. It’s 2018. Apps have been around for quite a while now. If your QBO account has multiple currencies enabled, you can’t use this app for banking.

Seriously, WTF?"
"Must buy two services. I’m self-employed and need to track miles as well as be able to send estimates. With “Quickbooks Self-Employed” you can track miles but you cannot send estimates. With “Quickbooks Online” you can send estimates but you cannot track mileage. To me, these things should be doable with the same service/app but here they are not. 

Plus, customer service is not educated on their product or helpful."
Great app. I’ve been a subscriber for about 3 years it’s a great app ... for me the one thing lacking is being able to enter and track progress payments.
Great app for managing every business finance needs. I love most of the features available, really great app and ecosystem. This is truly what every startup and business owners should have to manage their business finance. On the cloud and available to use at any time.
Excellent app. This is excellent app, save me lots of time and got ridd of lots of papers.
Great app really does work for my business. Really easy to do my accounts and invoices.
Way too limited. This app and the companion program that runs with it on a pc is so very limited. When entering information  downloaded from the bank you must first enter it then if it goes to two different categories you then have to remember to go in and edit the category to split it instead of just letting you split it on the first entry screen. I do a direct pay for my electric that the program interprets as a transfer so I cannot change to the correct category. I’m have to go and enter each entry then match it to the download to make it work.   That’s not the worst part. I downloaded my PayPal register and the program puts all my income in one category it made for itself and I am unable to change to match my company chart of accounts. And where are the ability to make journal entries to fix this stuff???  Your guess is as good as mine. Im one unhappy business owner.
Poor Quality. Poor quality. Inconsistent design. Loads of bugs. None of the bank feed transaction reconciliation/approval features have worked for at least the last three app updates. Expensive rubbish.
Extremely slow. Painfully slow on both my mobile device and MacBook.  Also, I have to refresh the app over and over to see the latest data. That wasn’t the case before. When I opened the app, it used to show the new data.
Great app but expensive. At $30/month it’s expensive. Now that they’re raising it to $40, I’m starting to question my choices..
No Packing List Option. Packing List and ability to share Invoive via Text, Fax, or any Messenger App
Disaster to sign out. I happened to see this app and found it is interesting to scan invoices but turns to be that I have to be a “company” to use it and have to pay SO MUCH for it! So expensive!!!!!!
Serious Problems. QBO is exceptionally expensive and important parts of the software that notify of quarterly and annual tax forms that are due are unreliable. I pay over $ 1000.00 annually for a subscription and payroll services and I only found out that the software is deficient because a state government penalized my business for a missed quarterly filing. That event led me to discover that the software also failed to notify or file two quarters of 941. This software is by no means best of breed for the price I pay.
Great App. Love the app. Been using for years and have never had an issue
Good app!. Add travel tracking to app
Limited features in the app. The app has extremely limited features as compared to web Cant send customer statements or edit recurring transactions or match partially paid invoices.

"Another update, still a poor application!. Once again, with excitement I upgrade only to be letdown. When will intuit make a full function app? I love the message that tells me the function isn't't available for my device but I can access it from my p/c...Great, I'm still tied to my desk! Why bother with the mobile app then?? Still, does not use all the functions of my iPhone. 
I love how I can only rate this useless app once in the lifetime of having it,I would give it no stars if I could!"
Can this App dethrone India specific software?. You can not setup this App to use for personal accounting. You can not setup this App for setting up multiple companies. You can not run if your internet connection is not working. So, this App is worth your time and money? You can try without worrying about any payment. So, it’s very difficult to dethrone India specific accounting software you already use. I have tried. You too can.

Nathalie Dodon Maquilleuse Pigiste/free-lance makeup artist. J’adore cet app pour me facilité la vie! Géniale pour les pigistes ou travailleurs autonome. Par contre on peut pas faire certaine correction avec l’app sur le cellulaire... il faudrait trouver une façon pour ne pas utilisé un ordinateur.
To much money. I went on to the app and it says 35 dollars and I think it is to much money for an app!!!!!! IT SOULD BE AT THE MOST 20$
Can’t enter, view or edit bills. This app would be great, except you can’t enter or edit bills. Workaround would be to login to website, but then what’s the point of having the app.. just use the website for full functionality
Banking. Great app just the banking doesn’t always pull over on fist couple tries to load transactions
Good unless u need their help. I had a problem as accidentally created 2 companies in the one profile. Subscription applied to wrong company and they had no idea how to fix it. The company with all my accounting was cancelled as ‘trial ended’ but other company with no data was fully subscribed. Very frustrating when dealing with idiots in the phone!
App is useless. Receipts and notes entered in the app do not show in the register online without additional steps. It doesn’t even show there is an attachment even though I selected show attachments in settings. So what’s the point. Absolutely ridiculous in this day and age.
Feedback. The app would be better if you were able to enter bills not just expenses. Very annoying to have to also use my desktop computer to finish my book work.
What a joke.. Can't add notes to customers. BUGGY! Cant print. Awful. If you are moving from QB desktop, think again!  There's not even an easy way to just view today's business. No reports in app. Useless.
App says I don’t have an account. The desktop app and now the iOS app don’t work. And accessing QuickBooks online from the iOS browser is a poor experience. From reading other reviews, this seems to be a known issue that has no resolution to date.
Great but.... Very great app. I rated three stars because you can’t enter employee time from your mobile device.   I know it’s a mobile app but you should be able to enter time .  I understand that mobile apps are a little different but this seems like a simple task that should be possible. I send invoices and estimates all the time with the mobile app other than that it’s a great app. Will update rating when these features are added
CIS deductions on apps!. Unable to do a CIS invoice on the app.. massive let down as this is not a feature yet
App Shortcomings. If you are a business owner or manager and having ready access to view/pay taxes and entering a Bill is important to you, this app is worthless as you can’t do that. I was hoping to ditch my laptop for travel and just take my iPad Pro with keyboard, but, this is not viable, at least for me. And if you think you can bypass the app for these things and open up QBO via web browser and work with that, fuggedaboudit, doesn’t render or work properly.
Unable to access my account. This app does not work. I am unable to access my account it just goes back to the splash screen.
Terrible customer service. My subscription got canceled unbeknownst to me due to a payment problem, updated my info and it just shows as “-$1” in my bank account and still says I need to update my subscription?! To top it off it kept saying there was an issue with my billing information and when I checked my account it showed several charges where I tried to resubmit the information when It said it wasn’t going through. I called the number provided, and it is one of the most frustrating processes I’ve had to endure. FINALLY got to a human being and was told I had to be transferred and was on hold for an hour before I finally hung up! Now I’m waiting and have had to do several jobs without QuickBooks, EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING!!! Will probably be looking into a new accounting/ invoicing program soon if this isn’t resolved.
So easy to go work with!!!. As a new business owner this app makes the process of dealing with the administrative side of it easy and convenient!
Where is the payroll functionality?!?!. The app seems to intentionally not include payroll functionality, that’s what I need most! F-
"Program not working. I pay iTunes for subscription.
I pay directly to them and my program is not accessible to me because it says is expired.
I make a case with them 1 mouth ago. Create another case 2 days ago. And still I am not able to use the program. Payed buy me 2 times (direct to them and iTunes).
Do not use this program you will regret like me."
Happy customer. I love this app.Can do my invoices everywhere on my mobile or tablet.😃😃😃
"No consistency between apps or pc. Your options and functions between desktop iPad and phone are all completely different. Need to send a statement of invoices from the field no problem if you have a laptop, you’ll just have to wait until you get home if using a tablet or phone. 

Need to get your company ID for customer service to resolve an issue? No worries just make sure your not on an IPad because you cant find that information under settings like the phone and desktop version. 

This would have been 4 stars easily if there was any congruence between experiences. The lack of consistent performance and the hassle of trying to remember what I did and didn’t do in a day so that I can do it once I’m home eliminate the usefulness and in my opinion benefit quickbooks online is supposed to bring.

Would have chosen a different billing program had I known. Now I have to weigh the hassle against the effort to port my billing to another platform. 

Save your money and take your business elsewhere if you work from the field."
One best app for accounting. One of best app for accounting
Google calendar. It would be nice to be able to sync google calendar with the mobile app for invoices like you can do on the Mac app.
"Access to QB contacts please. Love this app, means I can work while out with the kids. 
Would be better if my phone was allowed access to my QuickBooks contacts as my husband adds the contacts and they call before I have chance to add them to my phone."
"Mobility at its best!. Is like having your business at the palm of your hands! Just sent out a $40K invoice while on a cruise ship in Mexico. Also love the store-forward function. No need to be connected, once you get connected it will be sent out. 

Great app!"
Ótimo. Só apresentar mais facilidades ao Intel o app
QB app is Awsome. I really like the options on the app. Makes my business easy to run
Inconsistent. iPad app is missing enter bills.  Doesn’t match screen layout of online.
I like it. I have enjoyed using this app for the last year. I am blind and it is 99% accessible with my screen reader, voiceover. I only want to report one error. The last update causes the app to crash when trying to edit an expense entry  my Accountant manages my QuickBooks online account, however, when I find an incorrect category has been applied, I cannot fix it. The app crashes when I attempt
"Expense/Bill data missing in app. Expense and Bill data is not available in the iphone app while accessible online. What is the meaning of the app when I can't see any of my vendor bills or company expenses.

Development team???"
"What a bad program to help manage your business. You may be better off with paper and pen than to use this program. 
When I began using mainly the mileage portion I was pleased with what I assumed was a working app. I was able to enter travel between customers by entering a location or tapping the GPS starting point and on completion of the trip I would hit the destination GPS button which filled in the address. Unfortunately, the app doesn’t alway provide the distance. The next problem was I could not save the trip because the distance showed 0 miles, getting out of the app without saving caused me to loose all the data for that part of my day. 
I just found out the data you have collected does not transfer to QuickBooks, so what good is this app. I’ll bet you think that’s all, we’ll it isn’t, now when I try to stop my subscription of only three days, I have found no helps to cancel this terrible app and stop this painful ordeal.  Somebody please help me get out of this with out some kind of mental breakdown!"
Almost perfect. Please add the ability to print or download packing slips from the mobile app.  Everything else can wait till I am back in the office.  Sometimes a packing slip must be done in a rush.  Mobile app is useless to me without the packing slip feature.
Quick book app works amazing!!. Love using the app for my tree company lets me be on the road and make up invoices.
Quickbooks Phone App. So easy I can’t believe it.
"Challenging. I’m trying my best to get on with this app.
It’s proving really difficult!
If for example I carry out 30 individual jobs for a customer over  the period of a month I try and create a list of all of the jobs I have done including the date, the serial number and a few other words. Once finished I then realise I have actually run out of room on the invoice to show a list of 30 items.
I need to have a blank line between each item I am listing otherwise it looks cluttered.
When previewing the invoice prior to sending, the listing I have created is a very tight column of words and numbers.
The layout needs to be relaxed and allow 8/9 words on one line before dropping to the next line."
constantly having to sign in!. I wish QuickBooks could figure out how to not have the app constantly make me reenter my password.
"the website & app can not connect. i input the expenses transaction in my computer website (put all the details) and when i opened the apps on my iphone, all my transactions called (no category) 
what should i do? 
alrdy delete & re-installed tho."
Should of bought it ages ago. Such an easy to use app and system, back up support were quick precise and friendly. Well done quick books
"No too bad. This app for the Self Employed version is pretty good.  Using the iPad is less so, mainly because it WILL NOT rotate into landscape view and the appearance of the interface is slightly blurry / not sharp like other Apple apps.  
The features though, on the whole are pretty good."
Excellent. Very good app just hate it that it keeps bugging me to give a review
"Quickbooks Saves Me Time & Money. This app has streamlined my business as I am always on the go. Its easy, efficient and powerful!

Still missing critical features in international version such as online paypal payments"
Categorize expense. Useful. Would be better if it can scan the photo and also categorize expenses.
Crashes all the time. No matter what version this is, it always crashes on me. I never use this this app, although it would be fantastic if I could.
Connecting my business. As a Carpender who has been in business for almost 20 years switching over to QuickBooks this year has allowed a much more efficient process. The Phone app has changed the speed at which I can respond to customers.
New update crashes constantly. Can’t login. Crashed every time. Have tried reinstalling without any luck. Also, you can’t customize or get payment alerts for QBO except through the app. So until this is fixed, I’m stuck checking daily to see who’s paid and when. Pain in the butt. Please fix ASAP.
Lacking. App is seriously lacking in functionality. Don’t buy QuickBooks online unless you plan to do most of your work from a desktop. Kind of defeats the purpose. Way overpriced and they keep raising the price too :( wish I had stuck with the QuickBooks pro platform.
"Update killed app for me!. Used to love this App as I’m a paid subscriber, but the recent update doesn’t launch anymore.
I’ve tried removing and reinstalling same result. iPhone X."
Still need a lot of work. I’ve been using QuickBooks from almost 2 years, now I believe time has come to let QuickBooks go. Really irritating when it comes to mobile app most invoices I can’t even open. App kicks me out automatically. While you use your desktop version editing invoice is terrible from past few weeks now. You click on one item system delete 15 to 20 items at one shot. Really risky to use QuickBooks now. I’m thinking of switching to xero as it’s more reliable.
Hot garbage. Latest update to this piece of garbage app requires you to log in EVERY single time. Pathetic these guys can’t get it right.
Terrible experience. Downloaded QuickBooks to try it out. Two days into the free trial I tried to get the discount through Uber and was over charged for 6 months of service after the payment “ failed to process” then checked my bank statement to see it charged my account 6 times(each for 1 month of service) I called and waited on hold for an hour. Finally talked with someone who could not help me and recommend I call Uber to see if they charged me. The whole experience has been terrible. Waste of time and money, would not recommend to anyone. Find a cheap/free app that works and doesn’t steal money from your account.
Great features but very unstable and poor support. I’m an accountant that works with Xero, QB and MYOB. Quickbooks Online offers probably the best combination of Xero and MYOB’s best features but is let down hugely by the app’s instability (very slow and regularly crashes) and their support, whilst very friendly, is poor in quality and suffers from obvious lack of proper systems and workflow. We’re holding off recommending QB to clients for these two reasons. They aren’t quite deal breakers but close.
Need IMPROVEMENT ASAP. Need to approve the app ASAP due to many loss of customers.  Disappointed of the high price.
Absolutely horrible customer service. I have called for over 6months on issues related to reconciliation of one of my accounts. Hundreds of transactions are missed every month by their software and it hasn’t been pulling in correctly. After the 5th time of over an hour phone call- I decided to cancel my subscription and start over with a different accounting software. What’s the point of software if it isn’t doing the job it is supposed to? I’m back to counting receipts etc! Fail Quickbooks. It’s total junk. If you have it now- check your bank records in comparison, see how many transactions you’re missing. I’m probably not the only one.
Ease of use app. Loving to use app on phone writing invoices.
It was barely ok to start with!. I had used QuickBooks for several years and then went to the online version. I liked the features it had, but really didn’t like the 600.00 a year fee. For the most part it worked, but never all of the time. Then when they raised the subscription price to 720.00 a year, that was it. I said good bye and found another program. No regrets!
Accounting professionals client list incomplete. When logged into the account thru the app, I am unable to view all clients Quickbooks accounts.
Greatest app and programming. I’ve been using QuickBooks online for the Hess say at least eight years and before that I was using the books software on my computer and either way QuickBooks has been great except my business structure strong and you always let me know what payments were paid and what is not. So thanks a lot for having such a great application and program and I hope you keep going in improving every day
The best app for small business owners. I own a small business near Austin, Tx and I used to have to drive home to write up an estimate, but with QuickBooks they have truely made it easy and extremely convenient. I HIGHLY recommend this app.
Not reliable. App logged you out while you’re still driving or doesn’t log you when you need it to. This used to be a great app but then this glitch happen with it not logging in and logging you out when you don’t want it to and when you contact customer service there’s no help other than delete the app and re-download it re-login yeah that doesn’t work.
"Major Flaw - can’t add receipts to expenses. No Dropbox or photo option. They advertise this system as super easy and convenient. 

You can’t add receipts from photos or Dropbox. 

That makes the ‘add attachment ‘ pretty much pointless. 

I take a picture of an expense receipt but 0 way of adding it ... seriously. Who designed this app.???"
NOT AN UPGRADE FROM QB SELF- EMPLOYED. If you are running QB self employed and you are thinking about upgrading to QuickBooks then be aware. These are two entirely separate apps. Even though QB sells it as an upgrade it is NOT. You will lose your mileage tracking. The mobile version is not near as perfected. And the worst part is none of your info will transfer over automatically. There are some benefits to it and I am learning how to use it but, it’s very glitchy compared to self employed, I get a lot of duplicate/ inaccurate transactions, not near as user friendly, etc. All in all there are some features that if you need them there is nowhere else to get them. Just very disappointed since I based it on an “upgrade” rather than as if I was switching softwares.
Nothing good to say. Nothing good to say about the app, the cloud version or the Mac version of QuickBooks. And I’ve used every version they hawked at me. Some business don’t have inventory and sell products. And they just need a simple software solution to manage expenses and bill time and material and labor, send estimates and write checks. Everything else rendered absolutely unnecessary. Even the most “basic” version offered by them is still crowded with absolutely ridiculous and unnecessary features and you have to pay for them. And the apps interface is way to complicated and lacking because of it. And the visiting the mobile site is no better. I just honestly don’t see how so many people are complacent.
Please add a “transfer” option on app. Overall good app but would like to have a transfer option on the mobile app- I find myself having to login to the desktop version just to transfer amounts between my accounts. Also, someone please find a way to mark estimates as “read/seen” by the customer just like the invoices do. iPad version needs help; jumps around too much
Time tracking missing from app. I bill services by the hour and pay extra for the version of QuickBooks that supports time tracking. Was VERY disappointed to see this feature completely missing from the app. It’s such an obvious thing to have on the go. Now I need to have a totally separate system to track time...
Developors Don’t Use the Program. It’s obvious that most rate/review apps start at 5 Stars and work down instead of working at 3 which most people would consider average. Given that I would say it’s a 3 at best since those that write the program don’t actually use it and like most developers use the customer as the Guinea Pigs.
Good on the go. It’s easy to make invoices on the spot for customers and receive payments. I still prefer sitting at a computer but this app really helps while I’m on the go!
Tax problem in Hong Kong. I mostly use it to do my expenses, now with this update, they force me to input TAX. But there is not tax here in Hong Kong. Didn’t have the problem before. I don’t know how long they need to fix that. 👎🏻👎🏻
Response to the QuickBooks online Account App. I love QuickBooks Accountant online program; but I noticed that there are limits to the QuickBooks Accountant online app capabilities compared to what the downloadable online QuickBooks Accountant software program could do. Otherwise, really happy with Online QuickBooks Accountant program!!
Works okay but app needs work. Funny how if they spent a little more time and money on their point of sale app that they could get two to three times the amount of business. The app needs work. There needs to be more options for customizing the invoice and it really lacks customer management ability. If your just going paperless it’s not bad but like I said the app could really use some work.
Employees?. I can access my payroll and employees online, but not on the app.. am I missing something?
Terrible app. Absolutely terrible, even harder to cancel, don’t buy
Logging Out.... EVERY time I open the app, it logs out. So now I have to keep my QB password with me. Love QB but hate this app. Have raised the issue, been ignored.
"Desktop User Samples Online Version. As the Macintosh desktop version is being threatened by extinction, I thought I‘d give the Online version a whirl. I was excited by the prospect of using an App and the unconditional functionality of being online. DON‘T DO IT! DO NOT DO IT! MUY MAL!

The fact alone that Intuit insists on emailed invoices feeding through their server was reason alone cancel and delete immediately. As a therapist who works in the EU, the privacy violations/implications of such a feature would open me up to more liability that productivity. Guess I‘ll just go on and use the desktop version until Mac OS stops supporting that.

BOOOOOOOOOO!"
Does it work?. Great app. Keeps me well ordered and never lets me down
Awful support. My account went down on a Friday, with no support available over the weekend and my account practically unusable I contacted QuickBooks support at 8am on Monday. After spending 30 minutes on the phone and being told this was an Apple issue. 30 minutes later Apple told me it was a QuickBooks issue. QuickBooks then confirm after a further 20 minutes I am subscribed and don’t actually know why my account is not working! Not acceptable and costing me thousands by not being able to issue new invoices and check existing ones have been paid!
Unable to log AMEX expenses while mobile.. This seems such a basic function that this app is missing.
Worse than useless. I downloaded this app as use QuickBooks daily, the pc software is great! The apple app is such a waste of time, I can’t access any reports and the info it does show me is a waste of my time just a load of numbers that don’t mean anything. No thought has gone into this app I suspect it’s just a tick box exercise creating an app...
"Worst Customer Service. I have had quickbooks for over 6 months and have had to call customer service probably 10 times. I have NEVER spoken to someone who knew what they were doing and have always been on the phone for 40 minutes minimum while the operator reads through the instruction manual and tries to solve the issue.

The clearly have no training on the software and have no issue wasting your time. Wish I could go back in time and choose another service that actually cares about small businesses."
The best way to manage business. I love it and I can control how I ran the business easy and fast way to keep track of my expenses and income
App crashes on splash screen. On iPhone 6s Plus. This has been happening for so long and there is no action taken. I’ve tried uninstall and reinstall multiple times and nothing is working.
Update ruined app. Crashes constantly and that WHEN you can get in. Half the time it’s ‘downloading company data’ and won’t let you do anything. I find this making it actually harder to run my business.
App login. I can not login to app using my online login details. Have reset again and again and nothing works. Very frustrating
"Useless App for Working in QBO. Only found 2 reports available through the app. 
Can’t “drill” into figures on the 2 reports provided. 
Cannot access Expenses on COA 
Can’t really get any work done."
I doesn’t work for personal finances. I have tried to get my personal finances but failed. This app is meant for business accounting only and there’s no way of using it work for personal accounting purposes. So, basically this is not the app for individual personal financial accounting. Look somewhere else for it if you are looking for something similar to Quicken.
"Needs better support. Update, problem was solved in a new update, so app would get 5 stars but the support is still appalling for an app like this, if you have problems with it don’t expect help from the companyI thought this was a great app then it wouldn’t allow expenses to be uploaded, one of the main reasons for using this on the mobile app, support we’re worse than useless and could give no time scale as to when this would be fixed
To a small business working on the go this defeated the whole point of using a mobile app, am looking for alternatives"
Great but…. This app won’t get more than two stars until I can enter a Single Time Activity from my phone.
Awesome app!. Great product, has everything our small business needs, saved us a lot of time transferring from one program to this. Reconciliation is a dream, so simple and easy to work out. Have had no issues whatsoever and am very happy with the change over, has made life so much easier. 👍 thank you
Binoy. Easy to use interface love the app
Unresponsive. App not working not letting me update data for 5 days now. Emailed company still not sorted still not happy

Very weak. I have been a quickbooks user for years but the app is just weak. Employee transactions are not possible and reports are minimal. I consider these critical aspects of good accounting software and they almost do not exist in the app. I don’t need an app to write an invoice or figure out that someone owes me money. However, keeping track of my reporting to the government and paying employees is critical and these do not exist in the app.
I love QB.. That is a great app for me.
Very functional. Although I try *not* to spent time on the phone doing business stuff when not at work, it’s actually very handy to be able to do thing like receipt payment against invoices etc. after seeing a payment has been made to my bank account. I do invoicing with another app (ServiceM8) which is connected to Quickbooks, so I don’t have much experience what it’s like to invoice with this app, but for all other aspects of managing accounts I find it intuitive and very capable. Cheers!
"Great app. I run my one person business on Quikbooks and I am NOT a detail person.  My clients comment all the time on the ease of payment!! 

Love it

Love it"
Easy and effective. Very easy and convenient, would just like if they add the ability to create a Purchase Order to suppliers from the app.
So much potential!. I went from desktop to online. What a nightmare! Well, I’m really liking the speed at which I can create and send/print an invoice now that I’m getting used to it and have SOME of the kinks worked out. BUT......There is so much more this app should be able to do!! The accounts are not updated. When I do transactions on chrome or safari, the app is about a month behind even though the balance is correct. Transactions just done shoe!? You can’t do ANY transfers between my accounts. I have to go onto safari and then there is a whole other set of issues! Even when using chrome on iPad Pro you still can’t see the whole page or “buttons” to click to save something....over all I’m getting better at using the mobile version but it REALLY needs work for iPad version to flow like it does online on a laptop! (Which is what I’m trying to get away from) Anxious for a good BIG update.
"Going okay. I’m happy so far.
Love the bank link up, did four months of data entry in two hours 
I sent my first quote.
I’m using an  iphone 8 plus and will use as customer interface which I look for to when I get printer..
However I note that I will have to log on via a PC the set some things up as I don’t get that option on the App.
Love the finger I’d sign in"
Great...except. Overall love this software and application, it is the core of our company. Unfortunately, I have a experienced an issue when I email my clients after generating an invoice. I have consistently had issues with my clients not receiving the email, resulting in me having to cut and paste the invoice to my personal email account and send it that way. I have attempted to call customer support, and have made all the necessary possible alterations to this situation to get to work, but nothing has worked. The tech I talk to you even acknowledged the system is very glitchy. I have also heard other business owners that I know share with me the exact same issue. So for me, definitely two steps forward, one step back with this software
Mostly simple app. Mostly simple app. Only issue is posting payments to invoice within app but online no problem.
Ap crashes instantly on my iPhone X. I have been a Quickbooks user for about 3 years already. Ever since I got my iPhone X app doesn’t even open. I have tried hard restart, setting as a new iPhone and still encounter the same problems. It’s incredible that I’m not able to use it now.
Cancel and Start Over! Seriously!?!?. Try to edit or delete past transactions, make a shareholder capital contribution, transfer capital from old to new bank accounts. I was unable to edit/delete my ledger/transactions as owner and admin and I was advised by customer support that I should or Rather I am limited to “Canceling” my subscription! Btw. you need to get through an automated voicemail first. Good Luck! This is a well marketed accounting application with a neat design, it benefits from it’s pole position in the market and likely fake ratings. So essentially QB traps you and eventually you pay much more and if there is an error/mistake you can only “cancel” and start over. Hehehe... Unfortunately not many alternatives out there...
Simple and effective. I’ve always found the Quickbooks support team to be very helpful and quick to reply to any question or issue. The app doesn’t do everything that you can do from a desktop, however the basic functionality works well and is simple and intuitive to use. I’d rather have functions that work well consistently. Some navigations could be improved on to reduce the number of clicks but this is minor compared to the benefits of being able to do the essentials on the go.
Absolutely terrible!!!!!. This app is garbage. Funny that Intuit is in their name because there is NOTHING intuitive about ANYTHING in this app at all. Complete waste of time!!!  Complete garbage. Just trying to set up the basic information about accounts that I use and tailor the app to my needs was excruciating. I can’t say enough about how bad this is!!!!!!
App will crash!. App will crash! Be sure to save your work!
"Awesome cloud computing. This is great!  I’ll never have to worry about whether or not I have a valid backup of my company data (as I did on the desktop version). My data is safely in the cloud and accessible to me from any device with Internet access that I choose!  

Tracking of income and expense easy here through the mobile app with access to reconciliation on the full web version.  Easy to use!"
QuickBooks app. I like the app except I can’t seem to add accounts to the chart of accounts.
Find any other app instead of this one. They have been bordering a useable app for years but they seem to lack a dev team to fix the constant annoying bugs. I have reported annoying bugs and problems that almost make this app completely useless. They fix occasional bugs and then they return on the next update. Then they are there for 5 or 6 updates unfixed. I am constantly logging back in every other time and get logged out in the middle of writing a report for an invoice, having to start all over with my descriptions and pics. Huge pain and super annoying. I can’t stand it and seriously say beware of this crap app...
Subscription does not work. After 1 month free trial (in which I never been interested as I was happy to pay from beginning) the app stoped working. Payment is demanded, unfortunately on iPad or iPhone version either it is not possible to make a payment/subscription or the instructions are not clear enough or there is an error. To subscribe should be made as easy as possible.
Never stays connected. I’m being very generous by giving three stars but every time I use this app, it disconnects from my bank. I have to always use my MacBook to sync bank data and keep QB up to date. When it finally syncs, this app rocks and that’s why I’m giving three stars. I want to love it, but please fix the syncing issues.
Money Grabber. Quickbooks will offer subscription service. I paid for it because of the discount and then they didnt allow me to accept payments through their app. You have to assess the profile first before asking for payment.
"Best software & app for a small business like mine.. I've tried a few apps to do quoting and invoicing to my clients, but could not get a single solution that worked well on all OS’s like Quickbooks does. 
It changed my life and productivity, allowing for quick and easy usage which leaves me more productive to do what I love and it took the effort out of bookkeeping for me. 
A definite must to anyone with a small business or entrepreneur like myself. It will definitely help your business scale and become more streamlined.
Well done Quickbooks team!"
Recommend!. QuickBooks is a must have to swiftly complete business tasks like, estimates, invoices, etc.
"Better if had a Progress invoice option.. Almost complete, but not perfect. 
Still missing progress invoices feature. 
I’m using 2 apps because I need that."
"QuickBooks Online receive payment is terrible. If you can afford to have your customers pay online then have QuickBooks charge you for each payment received then taking those payments on putting hold on them like in them up for three months before releasing the funds then get the software your small business and can’t take the risk of having your customers payment held up at any point for any reason you don’t want this software. I had QuickBooks online and option to receive payments online. Two of my customer made seven consecutive online payments for over $19,000 without notice explanation  or a valid reason. QuickBooks put a hold on the deposits into my account. These same custom previously paid online with no problems the account showed customer payment received but not deposited. QuickBooks never notified me or explained to me why they didn't deposit for funds or what their policy was regarding holding customer online payments without depositing into bank accounts.payments. After making several calls to QuickBooks they finally told me that the funds were put on hold because of possible fraud and requested I send them in with the mask of documentation regarding the service and items performed and sold, were the items came from purchase price customer payment receipts hello cremation that I didn’t feel need to be disclosed. Even though the customers payments had cleared their account QuickBooks held the funds for over 90 days, collected the interest and gave me the runaround with a list of things to do in order to have them to release the payments and deposit them into my account. Quickbooks only release the funds after I threatened to go public and blast them on social media. I would not recommend you choose to receive payments online through QuickBooks. First there fees for receiving payments online are excessive, then they are subject to keep your customers payments and not deposit into your account, without notice or  explanation or valid reason for any amount of time.
Very disappointed in QuickBooks for doing this and the customer service responses I received when trying to get an answer why it was done."
Still unresolved issues 3 month later. I’ve had quickbooks for over 3 month now and since I’ve had it I have been unable to allocate my bank transactions on my app. I’ve flagged this to quickbooks and had responses but no fix. Keep being told to use desktop version for now! 3 months and still not fixed isn’t good enough for a payed for app.
Great app. Really happy and love Quickbooks
Great app. I've started using quick books as I switched from Kashflow it's much easier and has a great user interface.
I can’t look at invoices?. The app is ok. I have basic access to customers and their address and number. But when I go into a customer and try to look for an invoice it isn’t there. It’s nowhere to be found?! Extremely frustrating!
"Horrible Accounting Program. Barely an accounting program. 

One would think QB would create an online version mirroring their desktop software. Navigating the online software is a headache, let alone using it for basic accounting purposes. 

Of course QB ever improving their software is as likely to happen as me winning the lottery."
"Amazing customer service. I have needed assistance twice this last month in redesigning my invoices. Both the agents that helped me truly seemed more like friends then a rep. Both were very knowledgeable, patient and extremely helpful. Now I am actually enjoying my QuickBooks instead of grumbling every time I use it.
Happy customer, Karen Velasquez, Owner of See Through Services"
Amazing app. Excellent service?
What’s going on?. I’m paying almost $11/month for an app that “can’t update payment information right now.” This has been going on for weeks. I can’t even send current invoices. Pointless to have at this time.
NO Bill?. Come on, we can do all things with expense and nothing with bills? Bills are the big part of our business expenses from our vendors. They are not even added to the total expense on the summary dashboard, how can we really tell how our business is doing when a big chunk of cost not appearing? Please include the ability to enter/view/edit bills ASAP.
Downloads. Automatic downloads have been taken away, you now have to go through the print page to save as pdf, then name the file and save from there. Where as it used to automatically save and download with its own name. This app is getting worse.
App needs work.. Quick Books does not see the main product of its service as the app. Because of this, I believe they are not putting enough work into it. Every time I open The app, it is frozen. I have to refresh the app to get it to run. I am not able to enter credit card return transactions on the app. I have to do that on the computer. I have spent hours putting together an estimate just for Quick Books to give me an error saying they’re going to delete all of my data. I then have to copy all of my data to screenshots and then re-enter the entire estimate. This is probably cost me 20 man hours in the time that I have been on QuickBooks. Do more work.
Ability to do transfers. Good app just wish I could do transfers between my bank accounts the same as the online version.
Perfect for running small businesses, But...... Everything you need to run a small business...but $35 is way to expensive, shouldn't cost more than $25! I’m very happy with the software and with a few dedicated hours I learned how to use it inside and out. Recently I’ve been having a lot of trouble signing in using my iPad App, keeps giving me that stupid Error 503. Forget using QB Online on an iPad through Safari, does not work, you need a mouse. Frustrating. I initially gave QB Online 4 stars and not 5 because it is overpriced. Within the last few weeks (March/April 2018) I’ve incurred multiple situations where I almost smashed my $2000 iPad because of QB’s incompetence and their inability to let customers sign in to their App. Now it’s 3 stars because what is the point of trusting a software with managing something I have literally spent my entire life creating in order to provide my family and earn a living. We pay (in my opinion) a lot of money for this software. To be honest, I’m not sure where my business would be w/out QB...but when I need to view an invoice on the fly because a customer is standing in front of me looking for answers and I’m standing there looking like a complete idiot because QB App won’t let me sign in to my account giving me this stupid error 503 bS...I’ve begun searching for another software i can trust to work when I need it to.
Good for invoices. The mobile app doesn’t have all options from the desktop app. And it’s something that makes sense... I mostly use the mobile app to check on invoices status. Also the alerts ... it sent notification when an invoice is paid, and some basic information as well.
Great app, slow to make revisions. App works good 98% of the time, there are some things that I would change and they do not seem to be changing them
App Shortcomings. If you are a business owner or manager and having ready access to view/pay taxes and entering a Bill is important to you, this app is worthless as you can’t do that. I was hoping to ditch my laptop for travel and just take my iPad Pro with keyboard, but, this is not viable, at least for me. And if you think you can bypass the app for these things and open up QBO via web browser and work with that, fuggedaboudit, doesn’t render or work properly.
App not working on iPhone. I’ve been trying to install the app on my iPhone (6s) with the current version of iOS for the past couple of months. The app downloads and installs. When I tap the app to open it, the screen briefly shows the Intuit Quickbooks logo and then closes. I called support but the told me to go to Apple. The ability to use the app to capture receipts etc was a big draw to using Quickbooks online. Very disappointed.
Worse update ever. Finally you eat our petition to add calculator to the invoice keyboard and removed on this update? App freezes a lot
Progressive payments. Love the accessibility and simpleness of creating invoices.  Would love to see progressive invoicing added to QuickBooks online
"The app have few bugs & the customer support sounds like they not familiar with their products. When you create a new customer and saving it and then you need to change some information in the contact it still shows the previous info
Contacted customer support few times and they are useless"
"Great app but needs improvement. There are various things you can’t do on app .Example you can’t set recurring transaction, use batch actions for reminders.
For Indian users , they have not launched QuickBooks payment.
There is no customer portal ,there should be system for sending invoice and reminder link via SMS 
Overall it is good app and all does the basic stuff but should look forward to integrate above stuff as well"
Dashboard is broken. App needs work.. The app dashboard appears to throw up numbers completely unrelated to reality and almost always reports inability to retrieve all data. The web version, on the other hand, works fine. It seems not much attention has been put into app development. Disappointing.
"The mobile app is almost unusable. I have been a QBO user for more than a decade. 
It’s very obvious to the world that Intuit has little or no care about being conscientious about their mobile apps.
Normal every day tasks such as creating a Recurring Transaction are simply missing altogether.
As a multibillion dollar company, and totally neglecting customers with zero tech support nights or weekends, tells the entire story of corporate distain for clients they carry. 
It really is time to support start up accounting systems, that will cater to the real world needs of their clients. 
The axiom of large corporations being totally dysfunctional is so true in the case of Intuit."
"QBks App -> Less Than Half A Loaf. Having used QBks for 24 years in one guise or another, I have long since grudgingly accepted their inadequate technology chops. Be that as it may, I must let them (and you, dear reader) know that the iPad version is a HUGE frustration. In most regards the 12” iPad Pro that I use is the best. Most advanced technology I’ve ever been pleased to use. However, tech laggards like Intuit make it a trial. Anybody know how to cut a check from the iPad version? PLEASE tell me! Yeah. I didn’t think so. 
OK, how about putting in a bill? No? These are BOOKKEEPING items, guys! I understand they have as much to do with accounting as data entry has to do with data analysis. Yeah, these tasks are peripheral but ESSENTIAL. Seemingly IMPOSSIBLE with QkBks for iPad. 
How in the name of all that’s Holy can ANYone claim that this PoS (no, not Point Of Sale) allow small business management?!?
JEEZum, Intuit!!! Splash out some of that Monopoly Money for some up-to-speed programming talent! And this time do it in the US of A, where there’s a fair chance the tech staff will understand what you tell them to do. Please and Thank You. By ALL means, give me a reason to update this review with a higher number!!!"
Been asking for a simple feature for years.. Still to this day I’m amazed I cannot do the most important task on the mobile app.  If I’ve created an expense via my desktop. I have no way of viewing it or editing it on the mobile version.  It’s totally UN integrated.
It’s great. Although this program works incredibly well and I’m happy to of used it for the past two years… I would love to do an annual subscription, pay my payment once a year and carry-on.
"iPad App. Please update your App to be more like the desktop version...I can not track inventory received through the iPad app I purchased and iPad Pro hoping to do away with my laptop and so far its been seamless, except for this App not being able to track inventory received. I hope your developers can figure this out before my 8 year old laptop crashes!
Thanks"
"Very Disappointed with Service and Customer Service. Unbelievably disappointed in the service thus far. I’ve used Freshbooks for my other business for 5 years and have never had the level of issues that I’ve had thus far in 90 days.

I keep getting bombarded with YouTube ads. Even though I’m a paying user they are still targeting me and perpetuating a negative experience and wasting ad dollars.

They flagged an invoice to check we had the revenue to pay it if it was fraudulent. Never had this happen before but when I get a call from Corporate the number they called me on and told me to call back fails, the dial by number directory fails and then when I call Intuit they take 45 minutes to get me through 4 departments to tell me there is “no reason it got flagged and nothing you can do to stop this from happening in the future”

I’m not able to post a payment that’s a check during all of this for another customer and extremely frustrated with them."
Ontiretse Marumo. Amazing app!
Convenient but you pay for it. This app is really handy but they jack the prices up on you once you’ve gone through all the hassle of inputting your info. They know you won’t probably mess with changing programs once you’ve wasted all that time and energy. It is nice to use, however.
Awesome app. Quick books is really an awesome app. Links up to accounts quickbooks payments.   I can access from all my devices. It’s really versatile. You can make great estimates as well. Emailed invoices and estimates look very professional.
Why use the app when you it lacks the features of the website. You can’t change the status of in invoice on the app and must be done online only. This is a major flaw in the app. Once I do my taxes I will no longer be using quick books, because of the enforced complexity the system is rendered mostly useless. The app needs to have complete functionality of the site.
Pretty good but, but no bill entry????. I have found this to be somewhat helpful for reviewing expenses, but it would be fantastic if I was able to pay bills on the go. I would love to be able to keep my business mobile by using the camera to “scan” invoices and submit them for payment right from the app. A core function that is surprisingly absent. This is a must for future development. Without it, the app just come up short...
Great!!. Works so well. Love how easy it is to use, love how seamless the app works as well as the computer version. So easy to send invoices via email. Was so happy when I found out easy it is to use!
"Paid for subscription but no access. Apple says they sent the payment quickbooks says they never received it.... revolving door with neither party willing to help. 
Pay directly through quickbooks if your going to buy."
It gets the job done. It’s not a bad app. I can’t find anything that will do everything I want & the problem with this is that I can’t fully customize my estimate/invoice forms. They have preset forms that you can play with a little, but not enough for my satisfaction.
A changing life App. I’m new to the U.S and this app helps A LOT to get organized. Just love it.
"Does most. App does most of things I need for my business.  One thing I am requesting for is the ability to pay with a daily rate not just hourly.  I have a home care agency and this is how we pay our employees in some cases. 

Lynn"
Rubbish. On quite a few occasions including the last six or seven attempts ‘unable to get all my QuickBooks data’ think I’ll be binning this app!
"Be Careful how you pay for your subscription. As many others have mentioned before, this app suffers from serious lack of usability when it comes to backup and restore.  

Let’s start with some basics.  The software itself is great.  I very much enjoy it.  But beware, they want to monopolize the subscription market so their online software DOES NOT work with their desktop software.  So you’re either paying monthly FOREVER or not able to make out an invoice or expense on mobile. 

BEWARE OF HOW YOU PAY FOR YOUR SUBSCRIPTION!!!!  

If you subscribe through a third party like Apple, you can never stop.

My subscription expired and i clicked on the “renew” link that popped up in the app.  When i did so, it took me to a renewal page where i put in my cc info and added payroll.  Turns out, instead of renewing my existing company, they started a new one for me and were unable to transfer the payment info over because the existing company was LOCKED into third party payment processing.   

This started the process of having to backup my data and import it into the new company that had payroll attached.  As mentioned before, you have to export your data using an archaic system in IE.  Then most importantly, YOU CANT EVEN IMPORT THE SAME FILE THAT QBO EXPORTED AND USED TO BACKUP YOUR DATA IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!  It forces you to download Quickbooks desktop and import the file there and then export it from desktop to QBO.  You can’t even download Quickbooks desktop for free.  The trial link DOESNT WORK.  So, in my example, i am currently stuck with a third party payment processor whose payment info i can’t change (in other words i can’t separate my personal and corporate business expenses on a recurring monthly basis) and a system that i can’t transfer over.

WORST PRODUCT SUPPORT EVER
WORST INTEGRATION EVER
WORST PAYMENT SYSTEM EVER"
"App lacks functionality. Info being offered isn't current 2018 information. Try looking up purchase orders per vendor and it displays old scattered information. Not very useful... This app is only good for sales invoices and viewing P&L reports. That's about it. And who's to say that stuff is even current without double checking with the online database from Your computer. Payments: Unreliable- looks like I'm sticking with the GoPayment app. To best serve your paying customers I recommend perfecting your products before releasing them to the public. It just makes intuit look incompetent.

Dashboard doesn’t display all information."
Changed my life. Very helpful and easy to use. Now I am my own accountant and I can keep close track on everything I do. I love this app!
Blair. App is extremely unstable.  Every time I need to get on it I have to force quit the app and re loggin. I have an iPhone X and it runs horrible on here.  Hoping they fix this ASAP because I run my entire service company from the app
"QuickBooks mobile. Can’t print mobile.... on a mobile app.  
Still writing invoices and entering them later 2x the work and the price keeps going up."
App lacks functionality. Info being offered isn't current 2018 information. Try looking up purchase orders per vendor and it displays old scattered information. Not very useful... This app is only good for sales invoices and viewing P&L reports. That's about it. And who's to say that stuff is even current without double checking with the online database from Your computer. Payments: Unreliable- looks like I'm sticking with the GoPayment app. To best serve your paying customers I recommend perfecting your products before releasing them to the public. It just makes intuit look incompetent.
Not worth the cost. App continues to be problematic at best. The constant need to log in every time I open the app is a huge PIA. App logs me out at any given time even when working in an invoice. After app automatically logs me out when I go to log back in it gives me this stupid error that says “oops something went wrong” I then need to go through the whole process of logging back in and waiting for my company data to load. Sometimes the app doesn’t respond to my log in and I need to dump the app and start over. At $12.99 I can say to myself it doesn’t cost much but at $34.99 I don’t feel as if I’m getting my money’s worth. I also know that writing this review is a huge waste of my time much like the app. Nobody reads these or follows up by contacting me. If I ran my business in this manner I’d have no customers. Intuit knows that once your company info is in their cloud it’s hard to switch over to another app without losing some of your data. Thanks Intuit for selling me a product that is supposed to make my life easier only to make it harder and more frustrating. How do I get compensated for all of the time I waste babysitting this app.
Trouble with iPad app. Hello, I have the app In my iPhone and it works great, but i have downloaded the app in the iPad and it tells me: looks like your account doesn’t include access to the QuickBooks online mobile app... what I need to do to have access?. Please advice! Thanks
Disappointed. I’ve been using the phone app for a year now. When the app works it is fine however it constantly freezes and my only option is to restart my phone. I have deleted and downloaded the app several times but it has not fixed the issues.
SO. SLOW.. This app functions ok, I guess but it runs SO SLOW! Taking a receipt picture to enter an expense, for example, should be a quick and easy fast but the app moves so slow and it takes too many taps to complete such a simple task.
Demoted from 5 stars to 4. Using the app on iPad and iPhone for more than 5 years. Dashboard has been unable to properly show invoice status for at least 3 months now. Version 17.9, at least 3 updates ago? No fix yet nor response from Intuit after feedback. While I’m not fond of frequent updates, one expects to have these kinds of obvious bugs fixed in the next update.
Payroll missing. The app is great for invoicing, receipts etc however it lacks the ability to do payroll which becomes a hassle for what I need it for.
"Almost Impossible to back up data. Beware... Intuit has made it almost impossible to back up your data. To back up on a windows machine (backup isn’t possible with the app), you have to install internet explorer, which is now an outdated browser. Then you have to DISABLE ALL SECURITY on the browser and install an Active X control. Then you have to sign into QBO using this insecure browser and request a download. The first time I did this it took hours to get it to work right. The download kept going into a “virtual directory” that couldn’t be accessed. I eventually learned that this is how windows protects you from sites that don’t have up to date security (ahem... Intuit). This can only be “fixed” by disabling all security protections on the browser. So much for the “bank level security” that intuit promises. And each time I do a backup I have to reinstall the active x control through a laborious process involving completely uninstalling the QBO program.

Since QBO has a near monopoly in accounting they really have no incentive to make their products work properly. They don’t want you to have your data and can’t be bothered to create a modern download process. The thing that can be done with a click on your bank’s website requires hours of frustration with QBO. Come on Intuit get this fixed!"
"Rarely works. The QuickBooks app worked great for awhile. Now with the last update, nothing refreshes. I'm always receiving messages that it can't ""update at this time. Try again later."" Very disappointing"

Frustrating inefficient. After reading the 4 and 5 star reviews I’m wondering what level of accounting these people do. There are SO MANY features, views and functions that cannot be done on the mobile app compared to qbo online it constantly frustrates to the point, why even release this app in the first place! Registry access, managing bills, creating invoices things that need to be done daily fall far short of the online or cannot even be completed here. Intuit - this is far short of what I’ve come to expect from you.
Doesn’t keep track of suppliers. This app works fine as long as you only want to send novices. Unfortunately it doesn’t tell what you owe your suppliers and allow you to pay their bills, so while you are running around invoicing clients the suppliers will be sending the bailiffs round to your office.
Excellent app. Make life way easy for small business
Where is the option to invoice % of jobs.. I’m a painting contractor and I’ll do $100,000 job and be invoicing progress payments along the way and do not have the ability to invoice for percentage of the job that’s complete. It be nice to see that option in QuickBooks online
Easy to use. Great app to use
Great App!¡. Im always on the go and this app is great when invoice/estimate has to be sent immediately or when there is no computer access¡¡ highly recommended for biz on the go!!
Great program for what is asked of it.. Great program (i use desktop app on my MacBook Pro). but constant “improvements “ make it hard to find menus you once had. Needs a one click solution to print all open invoices at once. Biggest complaint is i get thrown off a few times a week. It’s a quick reload, and I have not lost any data, but annoying.
Hardly for the novice. I anticipated this software to meet the basic needs of my new business, and replace an office manager.  (If I can use an online tax filing software made for idiots, I can do this, right?!) Wrong.  First, only the self-employed version has true mobile capability. But that version is NOT capatible with every other version they sell you.  Every version upgraded from there requires a computer, or multiple apps, that aren’t independent of computer setup.  Information is not easy to find/learn. It’s buggy.  I cannot add a bonus to the same check as regular pay.  I cannot customize invoice fields, to add a PO # requirement. It would be great for pop ups to tell me what the outcome of my choices mean. I shouldn’t be complicated to cancel a check that was lost and rerun it as a direct deposit WITHOUT deducting taxes the second time.  For the importance of saving my sanity, I don’t need this software, I just need to hire a capable secretary!  Quickbooks rating ages 4+, really?
"PlLEASE fix the Contact list. Overall I love the app. I've been using my iPad pro for traveling more but we need this app up to speed. In sales view I would love a simple addition to show next to the invoice if it was sent, opened or not sent. It's a simple change and would save a lot of time instead of having to open up each invoice. Also, would like to see a total amount of outstanding invoices at the top, not just divided out in overdue and due. I'd also like in sales view to be able to sort by PO number and invoice number. 

Would also be nice to have a note icon next to each invoice number that if we click on it, it opens to show the notes we wrote
My BIGGEST issue that I have been requesting on all QuickBooks online apps for a while now is the feature the billings App used to have for FREE. 

A simple list of all the clients emails for that particular company in a list with a check box next to each. We can select our repeats to automatically select those to include in estimates and invoices. But we can easily click to add others or remove them and have a note next to the names.

It helps so much to have all of those email addresses for each specific client to select from. Currently, we have to go in to the clients info page and add the email there or go and copy / paste it into my email. Both do not seem very organized were thought out for an app it's expensive considering the free app you took over had it before. Plenty of large companies just bringing freelancers or they have different people handling billing. We need a faster, simpler solution to select company email addresses foe each estimate/invoice.

Please address these issues. If so I will change my rating to five for sure but right now there is room for improvement."
What happened to this app??. The QuickBooks app used to be a 5 star, user friendly, reliably functional app. Since December this app has had issues with freezing, crashing, randomly logging the user out and overall has ran extremely slow. I’ve noticed this on the app for Mac as well. While trying to run a business, it would be really nice to have a working invoice and bookkeeping app. Please fix this
"Online QuickBooks. Currently I use online QuickBooks for two of my business. And generally it works OK however there are some quirks that have not been fixed over the last two years.

The first one is when writing an estimate, it does everything you would think it would do however when sending it to your customer the titles it as a purchase order.

So every time I send one to my customers I say QuickBooks writes a estimate and labels it as purchase order for some unknown reason. I continuously apologize for the problem inherently designed in by personal that don’t understand the difference from a purchase order and an estimated...

But if you’ve ever tried to contact somebody directly at QuickBooks you will soon realize that they are super huge and the customer service is lacking.

This has been written by a multi year with QuickBooks online user, James"
Crashing. App keeps crashing every time I click on it!
Refund made impossible. I’ve been making payment on this stupid app not using it at all.  There’s no easy way to refund or unsubscribe this stupid app.  Who do I bring the attention to since Quickbook site says they have nothing to do with the billing and subscription?
Excellent Business Investment. I can't say enough about this app. It was the best investment I have made when switching from quicken to quickbooks. I was spending 20+ hours a week working on invoicing and now I can send them right away from my phone or send them in a batch in less than 5 mins. The app does have a few things I would suggest needs to be added like able to update recurring transactions and deleting multiple invoices at one time. Otherwise it is excellent and I use it everyday and enjoy it.
"Getting too flaky. I’ve been a subscriber for about 2 years now but am now randomly getting locked out of the app where it thinks I don’t have a subscription! I’ve reported the issue , it always gets resolved but then returns ! 
Went to do my accounts and quotes this weekend and guess what .... I’m locked out ... AGAIN! 
Is that acceptable for a business app ! Definitely not."
Purchase orders. Why are there no purchase orders in the app? Surely you should have same main capabilities as using full system.
"Epic receipt capture fail. This app is terrible. It is slow, has bugs, and it takes WAY too many steps to capture receipts and add them to a transaction - which should be the main selling point for this app. In fact, you can’t even add receipts to transactions that are “for review.” You have to add the transaction BEFORE attaching a receipt. Not at all useful when you want to attach a receipt do your CPA/bookkeeper can later weigh in on which account the transaction should go against.

My workaround is to add the transaction via computer, then go back in via iPhone to capture the receipt, but I get an error message if I do this right away...have to restart the app to get it to work! 

Given the choice between this app and a seasick crocodile, I’d take the seasick crocodile."
Jordan hugo ,. I'm young and in business , only small but this app is perfect for tracking my expenses and sending quotes off. Highly recommend.
"Fix this!. When using my new IPhone X the app crashes EVERY TIME I try selecting the “Invoices” button?! 

Also... constantly have to log in and log out to update my information?! 
Why?!

Please fix these MAJOR issues!"
Very Spotty Usability. Honestly, I love the idea and I love QuickBooks Online, but this app is usable only like 50% of the time... it always seems to say ‘we can’t get all of your (payment/invoice/banking) details, try again later’. So all I can use it for is to see profit and loss for the month. Would be nice if they could get that stuff fixed!
"Fantastic. We are a small Chauffer business, since using QuickBooks Online we gave cut the acoustic administration down by 60%. And it can be used in the vehicle via the app.

And best of all, it works."
Worse and worse with every update.. The more recent the update, the worse this app runs. Worked great until they changed to a new platform and now it's slower then ever.  To logging in or saving pictures out in the field, it takes an additional 20 mins on the job site just waiting for quickbooks.
Very happy. I love this app for my business
"Crashes all the time and there’s no way to ask for help.. This app crashes every time I update my iPhone, even when I update the app.

Don’t even bother trying to contact QB about it, they’ll tell you to uninstall and reinstall (like you don’t know) and then that’s about the extent of their support."
"Crash error crash error. QuickBooks is a four outta five platform, this app is a one...

Signs me out and crashes more than once a day!"
Can’t create POs in App. Wish I could create POs in the app. We use QB online with Shopify. I can only create a PO to send to my distributor from my desktop. I am often away from my desktop, in order to send a P.O. from my phone I have to log on to the regular online edition through Safari. I cannot use the app as I need it to function.
Unable to access Quickbooks through Ipad. Everytime time I try to access the Quickbooks it says I need to verify first my login which can be verified by sending an email. When I choose this option it says the time has ran out and goes back to the login menu. I am able to get in through the web but never in the APP
App is good support is horrible. Call QB for basic questions lady name Amanda hang up on me.. dial back in the she place me on hold for 15 minutes
Awesome!. I have always enjoyed using QuickBooks. Over the years I have moved from QuickBooks to QuickBooksPro to QuickBooks Enterprise and now QuickBooks Online. This online system is awesome. If integrates well with other systems I use, it’s easy to navigate (once you take the FREE courses), customer service is excellent when I have issues - and it will move straight into my Turbotax corporate filings. Love, love, love it!
Ok. Updates updates and more updates. What’s worse, arriving to a job site and it updating over the cellular network while a customer waits for me to invoice them. No update and it will not work. The concept and functionality is fine.
invoices and estimates design. The design and layout of the invoices and estimates templates are outdated. Seems like a small thing, but it reflects poorly on a business’ brand, and it is so easily fixed on your end. Hire a professional designer and give clients a template that says QuickBooks cares about our brand too.
Stuff always wrong or glitchy. Seems every time I turn on quickbooks by pc or mobile app, something doesn't work! Never buy online version, it sucks
Will not stop asking for a review. Trying to get work done and having to swap back and forth between invoices to get the numbers. Made difficult since every time I switch back and forth it asks for me to review the app. Well, there you go, 1 star, now let me work.
Slow at the app not compatible with iPad. Something wrong with this app , slowly uploading and not easily manageable on the iPad
QuickBooks online + App. QuickBooks Online is making my business accounts so easy. The bank connections feature allows you to sync online accounts straight into your account records. When new transactions are available, you can view and add them straight into your accounts, made easier by Quicbooks match feature that marks transactions with previous similar transactions. Support during setup period has been excellent which has made switching from another online accounting software quite an easy process. Very impressive so far.
Makes it easy. So glad I decided to go with QuickBooks, update daily to keep track of expenses and sales. Fantastic for my business.
Keep crush !. My iPhone version is IOS11.2.1. I can’t open this app. Keep crushing. Please fix asap.
Great app but not perfect yet. If they add more customization to this app like adding letterhead to purchase order and provide educational videos on every topic it would make a best app ever.
"So frustrating. Update 12/16/17
Still having the same issues after reinstalling the app on multiple devices...it always says “Unable to get all of your QB data. Pull down to refresh your page.” This always happens after the first successful login were I don’t get this kind of message. I’ll wait until this year is over and switch back to other more reliable solutions. 

Old review:
Yes, the app is helpful and you can track your money, invoicing and stuff. BUT I’m so sick of always having issues with either login or messages in the app that they can’t show detailed information about my transactions because of some issue they have. Sometimes I can fix it when I login again but that’s not a solution and $15 per month are just to expensive to have a buggy app running my finances. Sorry...if that goes on I switch back to wave app which is not a s convenient but it’s at least free and I never had problems like this."
Great app. I love the app
"Bugs!. So many bugs with this! I just rated it before and it’s popped up again asking me to rate. 

And I could go into so much more, however I’m only using this until next year. It’s shocking. 

I have just sent 3 invoices, the clients have received them, but they are not showing up in the app."
Great app. Only thing missing is the ability to track billable time with clients
"Review This, QuickBooks. I was using the app on my iPad, and kept getting a notice to ‘submit a review’.  Only choice was ‘ Not now ‘ .
After every transaction, after every page change, the message came up to ‘submit a review’ 
I pay a monthly subscription, stop bugging me. Here’s your review."
Nice, but they increased price a lot!. I like the app but am concerned with how much they just increased price for my service.
Slow books. Can’t accept transactions in banking section. Sluggish app, end up using the computer more often.
Handy phone app. The iPhone app has come in very handy for creating quick estimates on the road or adjusting existing quotes in the go
New App is great!. The new app is super user friendly and versatile. It’s easier to use quickbooks from my phone than it is from my pc now. Vast improvement over the previous versions.
Needs more... This app needs to have the ability to process statements. Then we would not need to use a computer at all. I was expecting to not to need a computer anymore and be completely self sufficient using my iPad or iPhone. Otherwise it is ok.  Statements is a huge thing for me.
"Simply Superb!. Quick books app really took my accounting overview in a single glance.
Thanks QB team for amazing UI"
"Another update, still a poor application!. Once again, with excitement I upgrade only to be letdown. When will intuit make a full function app? I love the message that tells me the function isn't't available for my device but I can access it from my p/c...Great, I'm still tied to my desk! Why bother with the mobile app then?? Still, does not use all the functions of my iPhone. 
I love how I can only rate this useless app once in the lifetime of having it,I would give it no stars if I could!"
Very beneficial app. This is a Very beneficial app.  It does not replace the PC version but is an excellent aid.  It's helpful to send invoices on the go or at the end of a service call.  The sooner the customer pays the more chance you will get paid.  As long as you keep things simple it is a very good aid!
So slow it’s barely usable. I have been using QBO for a year and I am actively looking for an alternative. The online service is slooow. Very, very, very slow. Like, dial up in a storm slow. The Apple apps on iPhone, iPad, and Mac all lag really bad. Windows 10 app is just as bad. You pay a monthly fee, then pay credit card processing fees, and the deposits take days. There are no monthly fee services that deposit faster. I have used QuickBooks pro fro years and love it. QBO is a poor choice in my opinion.
Worst customer service. I love the idea of the app but it’s too confusing I don’t get a lot of the options and customer service I barely understood anything was no help at all. I just simply needed the app to track income/expense and personal pay.
"Nice, but naughty. I am writing this review at Christmas, that explains the headline :) this app used to be awesome. Now I get a lot of can not connect to data or can not refresh data even after multiple refreshes.

Hope they fix it"
"Did desktop. Now online.. First year I got desktop version. One time purchase and no monthly subscription. I thought it was a great deal and safe being off line. 
By the end of the year I was so deep behind on every aspect of book keeping realizing desktop version is the same as steering a massive cruise ship without any crew to help. Big mistake.
I got online subscription now and most of the book keeping now is automatic. Not to mention I have instant access thru internet from anywhere in the world, on any device I have on hand at a time. 
Now my invoices go out automatically each month on time, expenses and income organized, and getting taxes done each quarter became a nonevent. I can finally enjoy running my business instead of worrying about paper work and book keeping."
Subpressions. Like the mobile app
Needs more features in iOS. I enjoy traveling light, and I travel for a living. I have the 12.9” iPad Pro and find the QB app quite limiting compared to its web and OS counterparts. Of course, I would use the web version on the iPad, but even then, the web version isn’t optimized for iOS. I can’t scroll the pages, the pages are clipped at the edges, and most of QB features aren’t available to me in their stripped down version of the iOS app. It can be very frustrating trying to get some after-hours work accomplished on the iOS version of the web and app.
Crap!. Can't create an invoice in the app that has cis? Really? Why not? So I can't do my invoices on the go?! Rubbish app rubbish system! Use another programme!
Not so great. Appears so different on mobile then desktop. Allot of functions not available in the app. Can’t really use it on the go. For example cannot fill the site details on app as it dose not appear.
Used to work. This last update has my app crashing and signing me out almost every time I use it. Usually this is fixed quickly but it’s been a while now. Please update the app so it’s doesn’t crash on the iPhone X
Review. Everything is great but the inability to create packing slips from the app. Kind of a key part of doing business...
Great app. Love this app. It makes running my business easier.
It is not the desktop version but online. Are you running two or more company’s with the desktop version?  You will need a subscription for each company. If you need some features then you will pay twice and pay more per year. Not worth it for us. So how do we get our money back from the 90 day trial?  Don’t know yet. Support only interested in selling us something else. Would not tell us how to cancel AND get the money back on the credit card. Online help process no help either.
"Problems with Quckbooks Subscription and access to using the app. The software itself has worked for me; however I have had problems with my QuickBooks subscription billing from the beginning.  At the moment I have a paid up subscription directly with QuickBooks (not through the iTunes App Store) I spent about 45min either being on hold or attempting to resolve the problem with  QuckBooks customer service yesterday and when I open the app it still is only granting me ""Read Only"" access.  Now not only can I not invoice my customers to receive payments I am sitting on hold with an estimated 21min wait time at the moment.  This is Ridiculous!"
Awesome product for small business!!. Unbelievably convenient! From my iMac, to my tablet, to my phone I can access, enter payment, send an estimate, or invoice, etc and it’s all connected because I have online QuickBooks. Hint: go they intuit directly! iTunes was charging me an extra $5 a month. $19.99 a month they intuit and worth every penny!! Biggest time saver + unsurpassed professionalism to my customers and speed of connectivity!!
Statements. Wish I could send statements from the app. I do love the convenience of the app!
Terrible. What’s the point of this app, can’t even search employees. Rubbish
"Works fine. Major flaw. App is fine. Isn’t changing your world if you have basic organizational skills and any knowledge of how to operate Numbers or Excel and at a high price. 

My biggest gripe, that I’ve told Intuit about for three years now with no repair, you can not export a sheet of all your line items WITH attachments. Meaning all of your receipts you scanned to make life easy can not be exported in bulk. I suppose you could go through and individually download each attachment. I’d like to have a backup if I elect to change providers or if I were to change career situation and no longer need QuickBooks. 

Would advise buying a scanner and using numbers or excel. Yes it is a little more work but no never ending monthly payment."
"Great product. I couldn't be happier with this app 
Is the best of the best, probably the purchase I ever done for my business"
"This might be 5 stars. The only thing... only thing!!!

Using square through The app .. or somehow sync invoices so they reflect in qb.
If there is a way to do that then this is 5 Stars!!"
So much you can't do on the app!!. App is a bit pointless as so much you can't do that you end up having to go onto web based site to do
"QB review.. Great program. 
Not able to print checks from app or change the total without adding all the line items amounts. I.e. estimates with multiple amounts as different options on the same estimate."
Great App!. This is a great app! Only reason for 4 instead of 5 is that there is restrictions to the app but not online. I do all my business from my phone so it would be great if the app was more adapted so I could do everything from my phone.
Expenses. You cannot cost expenses to a particular job or client
So frustrating. Yes, the app is helpful and you can track your money, invoicing and stuff. BUT I’m so sick of always having issues with either login or messages in the app that they can’t show detailed information about my transactions because of some issue they have. Sometimes I can fix it when I login again but that’s not a solution and $15 per month are just to expensive to have a buggy app running my finances. Sorry...if that goes on I switch back to wave app which is not a s convenient but it’s at least free and I never had problems like this.
App servicer. Qbo needs more reporting capacity.
Confusing. I used the trial a little while ago, and sort of went off it. Just renewed the subscription now with the exact the same email, but quickbooks somehow created a new company instead! The support for backing up the company’s data is all over the place, since there are so many variants of the software/app.
App barely compatible with computer. The the features on the app and computer barely cross over and I can never find customers on the app that I have on my computer so I have to jump back and forth to make things work.
Conevenient but lacks features. Overall, good for checking basic things on the go, as well as some other basic functions. It is far from fully featured though. QuickBooks online sees constant updates with new features lately, so it’s probably just a matter of time before the app catches up a bit.
"Limited. Not much functionality compared with the desktop app, frustrating. Unable to access banking or create bills.
Desktop app is terrible, every time I pay a bill and send an email payment notification I have to delete the words “Thanks for your business!” As if I want to thank my suppliers for their business..."
Changed my business. This app has worked wonderfully. It fills the role of a second employee. Accounting has never been so easy for both myself and for my clients to complete their bill.
Search using memo. I’ve emailed many time to please add a memo search option on the iPhone app. It is so time consuming looking for previos invoices of the same job site address, which I type in the memo section. I have to go to the customer’s invoices and look for it one by one until I find the one I am looking for. So frustrating, I wish there was an option to search through memo and type in the address to bring up all invoices related to that address.
Still can't create PO's through app. I use QuickBooks for 2 things mainly. To create Estimates/Invoices and send POs once the Invoice has been paid. I can't create PO's with the app so it's useless. I have to go to the website every time I want to create a PO. It makes no sense that they would leave this feature out.
Lost without it. I do everything on my app, from billing, collections, banking, etc. etc.  always works and stores everything I need.
Copy & Paste. We are unable to paste anything in QuickBooks app if we copy anything from another app
Couldn’t be worse. Worst customer service out there. Pulled money out of my account when they made a mistake.
A good portable QuickBooks app. The app has most of the important features, is easy to use, and is certainly a better option than trying to use the QuickBooks online on an iPhone. It is not a complete substitute as there are several features not available on the app,But it does allow recording time and expenses while on the road and even allows checking on and updating bank balances.
Great App. So easy for me to bill from anywhere.
Accounting Software for Accountants. I don’t understand why QB can’t get a clue and make a simple software package for small business owners. I don’t give @*!$ about debits, credits, assetinstaobligatonwhatacallits. I want to know 2 things; what did I sell and what did I spend. That’s it! Brilliant! Don’t know why QB has to make it so unbearably difficult. Just browse through the community forums and you’ll understand what I mean. I use it to download and reconcile my bank account. All the other information is worthless to running my business. All these big, bright numbers on my dashboard that mean absolutely nothing.
FMTT. I like QuickBooks especially the app. However, reconciliation is difficult and confusing. Also, matching. Deposits and making sure deposits are made in QuickBooks is so hard to figure out.
"President. I’ve used quick books on line for a couple years now and I highly recommend it to every one I e spooked to.
I’m on the road a lot and sometimes travel.
Any were I go I have a virtual office.
I don’t have to skip a beat with the Mobil app or the web based QB.
Just need to work I’m been able to submit statements from the app."
Thankful. I'm so thankful for QuickBooks. I'm still learning a lot about it, but I don't think I would not survive without it. I started a small business 1 yr ago. I love the app! I'm always on the go and can access it from anywhere. Highly recommended by us @ The Hygienist Helper, LLC!
Great but.......... I want to not be bothered with pop ups asking me to rate the app. This is a tool to use for business. I don’t want ads and pop ups continually having to be closed in order to work
"Great functionality for mobile versatility, could be improved. QBO has made my invoicing and receiving payments from clients, much easier.

I like the mobile aspect, app has just enough functionality that makes it easy and convenient to use.

As of recent though, certain data won’t sync with QBO browser version. Vendors, in particular, don’t sync up. This makes it a little tedious because you cannot see ALL your transactions in the app, even though it’s there in browser version.

Customer service has been excellent every time I’ve called."
I like the App. QuickBooks come with a handy app which is great. Don't have to work only on desktop.
Best app ever. Love quickbooks online.... easiest way to keep all my accounts and expenses in order.
Great app!. Only complaint is I wish I could create a invoice and with the total job and then invoice for a smaller amount keeping the job total on the same invoice if that makes Sense. No other complaints. Overall I would recommend to anyone!
Small business owner. App has shut down before I could save and I had to start over in the field.  I had trouble accessing it in the beginning. It is not easy to add an address to the invoice edit option for the template...
Hopeless. Ever since my accountant asked to use it, the App is never able to retrieve any data- keeps giving a message to say ‘Unable to retrieve data’. What’s the point of the App if I can’t see the Dashboard and data when I need to?
iPad app keeps me up to date. I appreciate very much how handy the iPad app is for Quickbooks online. It continues to add new & helpful features. The one I’m most happy about lately is being able to successfully “match” downloaded bank transactions. This keeps me connected to my actual cash flow without needing to have a bulkier electronic device with me. I travel a lot and being able to work with the QB online app is key to keeping my business successful.
Not very good. There seems to be issues here. A lot of errors with login on this updated app. As well as having to wait so long for funds to be deposited. Not happy
It works ok. Using this app for serval Years now. Mainly I’m bothered by the small glitches and performance of the app, not so much Quickbooks. Every so often a new annoyance will pop up.
1 Step Forward - 2 Steps Back. For the most part, the app functions correctly after finally resolving the issues with accepting credit cards. Now, it wants to download the company information each morning. It is doing it on all the devices and accounts that our company uses. It's very frustrating when we need to quickly pull up a customers information only to be forced to wait for it to re-download all the info. Hurry up and wait. Well they have updated it again, it just keeps getting worse. I beginning to feel like I'm the idiot for continuing to pay for this
Great for my business. The app makes checking banking records and status of transfers easy. The app is also very intuitive. Highly recommend.
"Fantastic software !. This has made my life a whole lot easier. Invoice and estimates on the go.
I really feel in control of my accounts."
Excellent. I been using quickbooks in various versions since 1996.  I upgraded to online in 2015.  As I am a working at customers premises, sometimes 15 different a day, the instant invoicing using my iPhone saves me having to sit at my office at the end of the day invoicing.  Another great thing about online is to check any outstanding invoices from customers who request unscheduled visits.
More features like desktop version!. Needs to be further refined to include functions and features like submitting statements. Simple stuff that just isn’t possible on the app version.
"Exactly what I was looking for!. I was so happy to find this. It would do exactly what I wanted.  I have used quick books before and loved it but this time I really didn’t need the all out real one.  

Okay... first off not a real person to be found to ask why nothing works so there’s that.  Maybe it’s not so for the iPad? The icon never showed up right not a big deal but if I pay for an app it should look good right?   Now the bank accounts don’t update right when on the phone or iPad... says updated now..push refresh the whole thing nothing new. Open it on a computer online and things update okay great but... not what I’m looking for in a mobile app!!  

So who knows everything is here and looks great but if nothing works?? Maybe it’s just a setting or whatnot but again... the real person? $5 a month or whatever this costs...questions ?  Maybe a one star review will get me a real person??"
Laborious expenses assignments. Uploading pictures of billable expenses requires two lengthy entries...first at point of upload info is requested... but for accounting purposes only. Second step is required to access list of expenses online and then manually retype ALL info listed under accounts into ITEM chart...date, item, splits, quantity, rate, amount, check billable and then re-enter client to be billed. Why this can’t be entered once at point of upload is rediculously annoying. My manual invoicing system took less time than this program takes!
"Left hand doesn't know the right. When I switch from logging in online to the iPad or iPhone, the app doesn't seem to be updated with the new information. Case in point, my credit card was hacked so I had to update my account info on all my subscriptions that used that number. I received a notice form qb that my account was suspended. Apparently it isn't possible to update the subscription info from the app, so I did it online. Now when I open the app it still says my account is suspended. One of many glitches that exist between the app and the online experience. Needs to be streamlined!

Also requires too many clicks to achieve objectives. Frequently crashes when trying to import a customer."
Doesn’t mirror QuickBooks Online. It’s good for looking up customer info like what they owe or phone numbers. If you create an invoice online you may not be able to edit it on the phone. And if you use QuickBooks for time tracking the feature doesn’t seem to be in the cards for the mobile app.
Great app. Great for small business but it's a little on the expensive side
Nice app. Works better than the online version
Perfect for running small businesses, But...... Everything you need to run a small business...but $35 is way to expensive, shouldn't cost more than $25! I’m very happy with the software and with a few dedicated hours I learned how to use it inside and out.
"App for small busines. Fact, this app save me 11 hours a week in paper work period. 
Great for small start up business"
Great App but needs better reporting. Need to see better reporting access on the app. I can’t run balance sheets on a custom format and it’s annoying.
Over promised, under delivered. The desktop app is slow and the mobile app is lacking pretty important features. Their tech support is horrible and can take DAYS to resolve an issue....if they even admit that there is an issue.
Love it. What a wonderful app for running a biz.
"Great app. The best invoice maker i ever had!
Great services"
"Superbe app!. Je suis travailleur autonome. 

QBook me facilite la tâche (pour ma part, la comptabilité est un fardeau) dans le fait de garder un œil sur les chiffres de mon entreprise .
Je la recommande hautement!
Seul conseil: faites vous assister dès le début afin de configurer le Plan Comptable ; y mettre les chiffres exacts dès le depart.
Vous en serez ravis!"
Don’t Rate before use. Fantastic app. Easy life. Worth giving it a try.
Needs improvement. With every update the app gets worse and worse. Not mention the desktop online even worse the iOS app
Brilliant and far reaching app. Started using this app following another app which was not giving me the usability that I needed. This app is amazing in its flexibility and ease of use. Get it and you won’t regret it.
Too many clicks for attachments. I keep track of all transactions by taking pictures of the receipt, checks, deposit receipts, and just about everything then attach them to the transaction. With the user interface rule of thumb of three clicks access to specific functions, attachments can take as many as five to six clicks to save a picture, which is very annoying and time consuming.
"Comments. There is no printing options for mobile printing. We have tu use other APP, to print invoices.

Poor in reports

Not friendly to do invoices"
Forced Payroll System Not working. Since March 2017 our payroll that they force you to pay for if you have employees has not working correctly. EDD efile is non existent, cannot archive reports, and IRS efile is sporadic. Customer service wont credit any amount nor can they fix the problem even after “escalating” it to priority customer support. Three “cases” opened, none of which fixed the problem. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.
Not working properly after update. People have businesses to run!! I understand glitches from free/cheap apps. Not something that costs $360/year. Why did you replace the PIN with passcode? I don’t want to log into my iphone, ever. All I need secured is my QB app and the PIN worked just fine for that. With this update I can login successfully once every 20-30 attempts. Intuit, test your updates before you release them!!!
Best app. Very helpful online support
"Poorest customer service I’ve ever experienced. Wow Quickbooks has done it again
Making key changes without customer notification 
Changes leave me hanging with no ability to do business
Then phone calls to customer service are long waits.  Must be effecting a whole lot of customers
Just a simple email or CS agent phone call might help.
But the changes for worse  again. Seriously poorest service ever!!"
Meh.... Still can’t accept checks as payment in conjunction with payment services on mobile app. Lots of glitches...
POOR NEED LOTS OF WORK. This app is terrible on the iOS and Android. I’m using it on both and it has tooo many bugs...
"Improved. Thank you for adding a “Billable” option for expenses!   This saves having to revisit transactions on the desktop app.  

To get four stars, this product would need to make selecting classes a little easier.  Perhaps allowing us to favorite certain classes so while traveling I wouldn’t need to enter the class for each transaction.  Also, please enter the cursor in the text entry field so I don’t need to place it there each type I select the vendor field (few transactions are with new vendors so defaulting to text entry makes more sense.) 

For 5 stars, consider adding basic OCR for receipt images."
iPhone X is not fully supported. Thank you for stretching the app the full height of the iPhone X. However, features are behind the home slab and is not taking advantage of the processing power because it feels slow. Not optimized.
Convenient. Great app now i can do the books from anywhere.
Works well but maybe more than I really need. I have a LTD company on top of an employed job, so the company is just me and its small and I don't really need it to grow. My accountant recommended that I get quick books. It works well, does a good job of keeping track of income and expenditure and the invoicing of customers is very easy. Compared to my old system in which I kept track of accounts using MS Excel and then made a PDF invoice and emailed it to the customer, QuickBooks is excellent, very quick and efficient. I do wish though that I could turn off some features. For instance, there are different types of income and expense, and it suggests that I have different kinds of banking / company credit cards, different business accounts. Some of this is just confusing to me as it is labelled in technical jargon that I don't really understand, I wish I could just turn it off to being income, billable expenses and non billable expenses. The other problem I have is with the invoice numbers. If you forget to specify an invoice number it just defaults to the last one you made. That is maddening. I'd rather it just prompted me to fill the invoice number in.  You can customise invoices from a template and that works well, customers tell me that they look clean, crisp and professional and they are easy to pay. Expenses work well, you can create an expense item within an invoice and even attach a receipt or a phot o f a receipt to it, and then decide whether to include those attachments in the invoice sent to the customer. Finally, it talks to my business bank account and so it tallies items in QuickBooks with transactions in the bank, ensuring that both match and querying with you if they don't. In all I think its a really simple to use, great product that makes my small business finances a lot smoother than before, but I wish I could customise and simplify it a bit more.
Missing Functionality. Reliable app but authentication is too slow. Also some features aren't available. I sometimes just use the web app through the browser to access those features.
Mobile app. You cannot check your inventory or edit invoices from the mobile app.
Good value for money. Happy with the program and functionality across varied devices
Many glitches, but overall good. There are many things that have been updated using the app, but are not updated when switched back to desktop. Invoices of emails to clients also don't include salutations which is automatically included on desktop. Unable to copy email address in customer details screen so would need to actually click on the email as if I'm emailing to copy the email populated onto the email section before emails can be copied. Little annoying things like this. It can do the basic functions while on the road.
Can’t bill my time from mobile. Overall it’s a good app. My only complaint is that I can’t report my billable time using the apps. They have a nice integration on qb online with google calendar, it would be nice if they also add that to the mobile app. At minimum you should be able to report time to a project in the mobile app.
Great App. Allows me to invoice on the fly. Easy to get things done. I don’t have to be home to do them.
Nice apps. Nice apps
Unuseable. The developer disabled the ability to paste in your password. I cannot use an app that requires me to spend two minutes pecking in my 28-digit password every time I want to use it! Enable paste and I will give this app a try.
App doesn’t get updated with the website!. This is most ridiculous app! It doesn’t get updated with the website! They charge you $40.00 per month with no resolution in the near future.
Amazing app when it works. Haven’t been able to use this app as of late because I use a password manager and the QuickBooks app stopped allowing me to paste my password into the password field at login. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling the app, still didn’t work. This issue has to be fixed.
Quickbooks/joist sync. None of this is working at all. For a company that does bookkeeping it’s ironic that I’ve been charged twice in less than thirty days for a trial period!! None of my invoices are synced, Estinates are counted as revenue and quikboojs is stating my 90 day old business has 1000 net profit!! Not even remotely possible! This is incredibly frustrating and so I have to work on this on my only day to rest. Ridiculous!! Do not use this app
Changed my life for the (much) better!. I’m dumbfounded on a daily basis by how easy Quickbooks has made operating my business just with my phone. I shudder to remember days without it. A few things are still necessarily performed on my laptop but I couldn’t be happier. The payroll function is great, too. I could see how a larger company would need a more complex service but for a small business with a few employees and a small number of vendors and suppliers it more than meets my expectations.
Awesome. Great app and very easy to use!
Good for on the go. Good for on the o, definitely not the same as on the desktop, but pretty good app for most things you need to do quickly
Waste of Time. I paid for the app to get the discount, spent an afternoon inputting information and suddenly it wouldn’t save anything. Logged out, Rebooted, problem still existed. Uninstalled app. On reinstall, the system didn’t recognize my login and I couldn’t access any of the work I input. Apple has my $$$ though!
"Room for improvement. It’s a good app, with some good features, perfect for using on your phone. 
It would be nice, however, if the iPad version was more like the web version with more of the features available there. It’s frustrating having to switch between the two versions."
"Absolutely Useless on iPad. You cannot edit a bill from a customer, you cannot add stock, you cannot add time billing, all you can do is receive payments create an invoice, add expenses, add customers. Anything else you need the full computer version. 

I use the full computer version at work, but I find the iPad version totally useless and a waste of space. I would love to be able to bill clients while I am out using a timeline app, but you cannot. There are many things I would love them to include on the iPad version but they do not. 

In fact I may even be going back to the book and ledgers soon as I find that I am losing so much time by having to do things twice, I am seriously thinking about going back to the hand written ledgers."
Great Support. We use the app almost exclusively to keep our business mobile. Recently had an issue and contacted customer chat to get it resolved. They had me screen record it happening and said they would push to engineering for fix. Honestly didn’t expect anything fast but they fixed the issue and included it in the new patch. It’s been about a week or less so a big thank you the support teams for getting it fixed and getting us back to normal.
"Can Not Do Custom Invoice Numbers. The app can not do custom invoice numbers. I have had the app for two months and paying the monthly fees and have not been able to send out my first proper invoice. I have asked support and they come back with instructions to go to certain settings that do not exist on the app.

11/8/17 Update. 

I’m still having issues with the QuickBook App. It appears they should not have released an app at all. It doesn’t do much and will not even reconcile with the main online version. I just had an invoice that was overdue and incorrect show up and when I tried to delete it the app came up with and error telling me it could not be found and to check with the online version. I’m doing business from the app and now I find out it doesn’t even match the online system. It is a disaster. 

I use the free software called WAVE before and never had these kind of issues."
There are other options .... Not with the $35 dollars they take in addition to % of every transaction. I would suggest another program and app. I personally would like the app to be able to send reminders for invoices but the app will only send them out.
Poor customer service. I've had the app for 3 months. Accounting part is fine. Invoicing is fine. Nothing spectacular. I set up the payment processing and have maybe taken 2 payments. Most of my invoices are commercial which don't pay by credit cards. All of a sudden my credit card processing was terminated without any notice and no logical explanation was given. Now since I have already paid for this I need to use multiple companies for my invoices which is the reason I switched to them in the first place. I would do your research before making the decision to use this company.
Excellent interface and convenient app. This app is a life saver and helps me run my small business affairs smoothly. I can submit my invoices and estimates on the go with ease. Definitely a must app to have.
Great App. The only thing I would change is making the app run things like the “Report” section so that i could view Profit and Loss in categories such as “Classes” or ‘’Cash/Accural” and add the ability to view and record Sales Tax payments. Other than that this app is amazing and I don’t know how I would run my business without it.
Paypal Integration very poor. Quickbooks say it integrates with Paypal and automatically downloads transactions. Well, it does partly, but doesn't download into expenses the transaction fees with Paypal Here, meaning you have to do it manually. It will do it for an online purchase to the same account so why it doesn't work properly is a complete mystery and one support do not help with.
Extremely limited. No Credit Memos, you can't have a simple addition of how much you have to receive in open invoices at a specific date, no journal entries. I have only my iPad pro and if I try to access the web version, it's not compatible with any browser on iOS. So you're stuck and you need a PC/Mac only for these things. It's a terrible, terrible experience.
Bookkeeping on the Go. I own a small tax and Accounting firm and this app has done wonders for customer service! Being able to give my clients real time information from anywhere at anytime is a huge plus! I only wish this app would allow me to process ach and credit card payments on the fly!
I like it. I like it good app
Frustrating at times.... Use it for a small business and overall it works great.  But... it seems like it will randomly decide to log me out when I just used it hours or minutes earlier.  Normally this is not a big deal but good security practice...  Like most security minded individuals I use a password app for storing hundreds of complex passwords that can be easily copied and then pasted into an app.  For some “brilliant” reason the QuickBooks developers have recently disabled the ability to paste a password during login.  I guess I’ll now change my long complex password to something I can easily remember making it less secure!  The ability to paste a secure password is good practice that all major vendors support - why is QuickBooks disabling it???
"Very convenient, but.... Working on the road, QuickBooks has been making the accounting an easy daily task. At least until their recent update. Opened QuickBooks and voila, it did an update. Completed, and  now it’s no longer compatible with my mobile computer.
A little more difficult to use, they have a mobile app for the phone which saved the day, for the moment."
Jireh Landscaping. Great!! Great program and App!!
"Simple things just don’t work in this App.. Now I can’t copy my password from my password safe into the QuickBooks login. This means I will have to use a simple easy to use and less secure password.

Also, there is no way to enter check numbers into the bank transactions. This works fine on a Mac and on-line but not in the iPAD app.

These simple problems make the iPad app almost useless."
Fantastic for when you’re on the move. This app has really helped me operate more efficiently from a mobile office. The ability to quickly and easily produce quotes and invoices from my iPad has been extremely useful. The app isn’t as fully featured as its desktop counterpart but it does enough to suit my needs, whilst I’m on the move. I’m running this app on a 10.5 iPad Pro and it has been flawless.
J’aime!. It’s a great app. I love it!
Overall good product. Not having access to the entire online tools on the app makes for complicated tasks at times. The online browser does not run fluently with a safari browser so if I need anything beyond basics I need to get to a PC.
"Missing Features from QB Online. I use QB for invoicing and purchase orders, and I only work from my IPad.  Couple of things:  You can’t create a PO on the app—I have to sign in to QB online and it’s still very buggy. I’ve lost about 3 POs so far during random refresh times, when QB “invites” me to try the app...completing a task that is unavailable on the app. This is also frustrating as I pay for QB pro—why can’t I have all the features on the app? 
Second: I like to personalize my emails with the invoices; I have noticed that sometimes it accepts my changes and sometimes it does not. The default “Here is your invoice!” Is a little too cheerful/juvenile for clients to whom I am sending 2nd, 3rd invoices, and too impersonal for clients who are receiving their initial bill. 
App would receive 5 stars if I could do both of these things reliably."
Password Paste DOES NOT WORK. I use a PW management tool and can no longer paste it into the App. This is really annoying as my password is totally random and 15 characters long!!!
"Can’t Paste Password. When I try to log in I can’t paste my 32 character password from the clipboard. This is a frequent frustration due to how often I have to log into the QuickBooks app combined with my desire to use long, complex passwords that I store in a password safe. 

Please fix this issue ASAP."
It works most of the time. It’s useful to have the app but more often I go to the browser site as you can do more on it.  The app is good if you just want to record a quick expense and take a photo of the receipt to attach.  QuickBooks itself is a good Accounting package, it’s just the app needs a bit more functionality.
"Great way to do your books while on the go. I’ve been a QB user for 8 years now and only recently upgraded to the online version. After several months of relearning how to use QB, I’m now enjoying the flexibility of the app. 

What I’m using the most in the mobile app is creating customers in the field. In my business, I will do my work and create the customer while in the field, then complete the invoice when I get back to my office. Being able to create customers AND starting the invoice in the field is a time saver."
ADDING PDF. Can not add pdf attachments. To my invoices. App is crashing. Please fix this.
My experience has been mostly positive. With Quick books based upon the fact that I only use the basic service for sending out invoices. Biggest problems have been not being able to sign in a couple of times and having had both good and bad experiences with help desk personnel. I use 2 accounting apps. Square, which I run all cash, credit cards, gift cards and tax based revenue through. Quick books Is only used for my non-taxable customers who get invoices and pay by check. This keeps things simple for me as Square is hardly ever any problem and I have workarounds with Quick Books when problems arise. Since QB handles no money for me they cannot hold my business hostage at any time. And since both programs have numerous reports this also  makes my tax requirements easy. However, one other thing I dislike about QB online is their constantly changing the program. Everyone likes their Apps kept up to date but I hate when they change things just for the sake of touting “look we made another improvement “
Do not waste your time on this free version. This is a very limited app. Do not try it! App is limited and they just try to up sell the full version. Support friendly but can not support a mobile version on an IPad . This product only good for desk top computer. Would not recommend to anyone. BEWARE. Check out other reviews I simply ignored the negative reviews now I am writing one.
App is handy, but buggy. Recurring invoices are a wreck. I have had the same issue for 2 years with Quickbooks resetting my settings EVERY month and automatically sending invoices to my clients without approval.
"Downloading company data 24/7. When the app works it’s good and the recent updates have proved helpful.

However 9 times out of 10 I am unable to use this app. It is constantly in a state of downloading my company data and while I do this all I can do is wait. Very frustrating.  As a result I have access QB through chrome on my phone and that has a number of rendering issues."
THE BEST APP OUT THERE BY FAR. The App is excellent for anyone on the go. Easy to upload info from the app. User friendly. Tried a few other book keeping apps and found this to be the best by far. Every update includes a very useful useable option. 👌🏽👌🏽
iOS 11 glitch. Hi. Since I upgraded to iOS 11 the  QB app does not allow me to do split transactions. This is a major glitch for me as most transactions are split. Please can you get on to this as soon as possible. As a user of intuit software for nearly 20 years I know you'll fix this. Thanks for great software.
"Weak on the Vendor side. 2017-10-20 -  I would not recommend.  Please try other options before making any subscription to QB.   If Quickbooks is your only option, start from simple start Version, then if the need comes then you can easily upgrade. With no time or data lost.  However if you start from a higher versions , to downgrade is easy as well but qb made it so difficult so you will not be able to downgrade unless you loose time and data.

2014-05-09Okey app but needs major overhaul improvements.
1) you can't even attach  any document (except photos.  Who uses photo docs these days anyways?) to your invoice while you are on the go
2-Easy to upgrade your your version and IMPOSSIBLE TO DOWNGRADE.
3)-Very weak on the billing and statement for vendors ( example when Recording an expense, this app does not have the capability of recording the item count you spending For example ( 50 gallons of diesel * $3.25  = total) this app can't do this.
Very weak on the billing and statement for vendors
That's why I gave 1 stars otherwise it would get 5*.
I think the time to look for an other home (I mean accounting software) has come.   Please share possible altanitives.  Thanks"
Super app. Very satisfy with demo. App looks and works super but expensive! :(
"Experience getting worse. Entering transaction requires way too many taps. It isn’t location aware to suggest transactions you just always search. 

Recent updates have some bug that makes the app download the data file with almost every login and login often you must.  Usually twice a week it loses my password. 

I have enjoyed QuickBooks online but this app experience may have me evaluating competitors in December."
QuickBooks Online App needs lots of work still. The basic problem is it’s WAY too slow no matter where I am. Usually end up just going through the internet. They are always changing things !😡
Playback Publishing. Good Accounting App
"Not that good, just ok.. The app doesn't do everything. So I go to the webpage. When I do, there's all these dumb invitations and prompts to use the app, which doesn't do what I need it which is why I am there in the first place. Marketers, true to their nature, are ahead of the tech department.

I can't see the whole screen on some of the webpages. Unless I go to a computer, which defeats the purpose of QB on-the-go, I don't know what is in the corners of the screen.

The bill to and ship to shown on invoices and estimates is mega-aggravating. It ends up the in right spot sometimes, at best. How can I present myself professionally when QB is making unfixable typos on my behalf?

If you enter a customer, then change what you entered at a later date, it's like a baby bird has imprinted on the wrong mom and it can't be changed. Again, professionalism is at risk. Baby bird follows you around indefinitely. 

However, QB does lots of things well. It is probably the best out there, which reveals a kinda pathetic marketplace for this stuff. 

Good luck with QB!"
Amazing. Is a great app, I love doing all our book work from my phone. Anywhere anytime. Only down full is I can't do the pay run on the app or phone internet. I need a laptop or computer to do it. Other than that, GREAT!
"Love the software. Understanding that all software are more friendly on the actual computer than in the cell app, even though, the cell app is very helpful for invoices, estimates, reminders for payments “on the go” just to mention a couple of them.
Being an 8 years user from CheckMark Multiledger and Payroll and making the transition to quickbooks is just a huge step forward and very efficient for my firm."
good app. very detailed , im no pro @ accounting but i am teaching myself this App.  its very in depth and i like it.
"Don't do it!!!. Having been with Quickbooks for 10 years since my ex-accountant suckered me into it I've a few observations. 

1. Said accountant no longer uses it. 
2. Customer services are selective as to whether they respond and irritatingly unhelpful when they do
3. Multi-currency costs lots extra. If you are a small scale exporter go elsewhere for cheaper. 
4. If you want to get out? They make it close to impossible for you to take your accounts with you. This should be against the law but they can afford clever lawyers. 
5. UI is a joke. 
6. No sign of them offering auto-uploading to U.K. tax authorities as will have to happen by law soon. In obfuscating they'll keep suckers like me who can't leave but will lose business. 
7. If they do? Serves them right. If they get in a huff over Brexit and stuff us Brits? I'm no fan of Brexit but be thankful for small mercies."
"Getting better but a long way left to go. We switched to QuickBooks on the recommendation of a number of accountants. Then we realized that quickbooks online and the desktop offering are worlds apart. 

The app is good, but not great. The entire QBO experience is frustrating and getting support is difficult."
Office. Excellent app
CEO of GD2K. This is a really good app it has help our business in so many ways. It help boost our profit margin we have been able to close deals, and make invoices right on the spot. I recommend this for a lot of different business with QuickBooks online.
Slow to load pics. Great app however very slow and the pictures take forever to load up to invoices. Sometimes cuts me out while I’m in the middle of an invoice I have to start from scratch. I’ve already upgraded the iPad and upgraded whatever software and gigabytes that they recommend me do and it still the same it’s slow. They should not call it QuickBooks they should be calling it slow books. Unfortunately there’s nothing else out there that can compare to this technology so basically at their mercy. Steve in Centennial Colorado
Getting frustrated. I hate that the computer version keeps crashing. The app is nice but doesn't have all the features of the web version (or if they are there I haven't found them yet!)
Worst service. Changed a template I have used for invoices and estimates for 5 years without warning or reason I cannot access the ones I sent even one week ago customer service said I was using a classic template and it's gone and not coming back . Makes zero sense it's 2017 get a clue . Don't buy don't join charge back!
"Great- can scan bills directly with phone. I use phone App instead of PC sometimes, as I can record bill right when I make purchase, complete with scan on receipt.
Awesome."
So much effort!!. Downloaded this to try and make my life easier but setting it up is so much hassle!! Can't add my bank account for some reason though I believe I'm typing the right details in - zero replies to my emails for help and whenever I've called for help I end up speaking to someone who obviously has no clue about the app for 30 mins - why is it so difficult?! Don't bother.
"Not as god as desktop or web access. I’ve been using QuickBooks online for over a year and while it’s ok, it’s really lacking in a lot of areas. 
Also, the mobile app can not perform a variety of common tasks that the computer app and web interface can do. 

For instance, I cannot edit certain invoices on mobile if they have expenses included. 
Once an expense is added to an invoice, only the desktop app or web interface can edit it. 

Also, as many have said, if you’re used to the traditional QuickBooks PC or Mac software which has been available for many years, the hosted version can be difficult to adjust to. 
It’s not capable of everything the older software can do, and a separate paid subscription is required for every company file you maintain. 

I am self employed with fairly simple invoicing needs, and I still have to use the most expensive subscription in order to simply link expenses to invoices.

The hosted services leave a lot to be desired, but they do have som me positives as well. 
For instance, I’m able to provide my outside tax accountant with web access to my company data 24/7 from anywhere. 
That’s probably a big time saver for me and many other small businesses."
"Good but can be better. The app is pretty good, I like how you are able to categorize the bank feeds. It’s laid out nicely. The only thing I would really like to see would be a detail when “matching” the transactions. You were only able to see the amount and often times there are several items with the same amount. It would really be nice to see whether it’s a transfer an invoice or the account that you are matching the transaction to.
You could simply add it as a small detail underneath the amount."
Frustrating!. This app and the full cloud service is very frustrating. I am an accountant and I’m beginning to look for alternatives for my clients because QBO, app and full cloud, crashes  repeatedly. My clients experience countless hours of downtime throughout the day. Also it makes no sense that QB Self Employed has the ability to track mileage but the more expensive versions such as essentials and plus, do not have that ability. I have clients who are self employed but they need essential or plus version of QBO and they are not able to track their mileage. Instead, they have to use a third party app. It would be nice to be able to setup other accounting capabilities such as tracking loans and investments. Come on QuickBooks! This level of service is unacceptable.
Fantastic QB's app. This app is great! Works just as good, if not better, as the desktop version. To me it seems even more user friendly & it is just so convenient when on the go. Definitely download! It works so well, I decided to pay the monthly fee to use it.
So far so good. I’ve only been using a short time, but I like the speed and usability, more than on the desktop app.
Slow. Can be great and convenient but it can also be very slow (just like the online version). Won't always let you edit invoices through the app.
Happy with the App. I’ve used for QuickBooks and the app for a year now and it has really helped my business and is a easy way to keep track of customers and quotes
"Good. Great product however cannot get online payment via PayPal to work. 
Also would be convenient if could add accounts via the app and not need to log onto computer."
No App support for Time Activity. Come on QuickBooks! No Time Activity entry in the App?! Ridiculous!
One of the best accounting software.. Very good and well made accounting software. Very easy and friendly to use. The things I especially like about this application is that I can book an expense on the go through the mobile app and I can access this accounting software from anywhere and on any device!!
"Gerald. Tax . tax here applied is actually confusing as only sales tax is taken into account. It's as if purchases or expenses are not taxed. If you need to claim tax on purchases or expenses doesn't show anything. It's as if I do it manually or. 
How do I import Quickbook intuit into QuickBooks online. 
Or
Why not merge some features in intuit to online. It's not only as you say to do invoice as you go but you can't account for your taxes."
Outstanding. Very user friendly app. Like nothing you have seen in accounting. The future is here.
"Great app. An amazing application for small business owners. 
A personal accountant only for 700 egy a month + you learn accounting"
"So far so good.... The app does what I need it to do mostly. One of the coolest things is being able to photograph my biz receipts into the app, and throw away the original. I'm not crazy about the app in terms of creating invoices that do not match what my desktop version looks like. Hopefully the fix for that comes soon. 4 stars from our end.

**update review 10/4/17**
Still cannot create invoices in the app that look exactly like the invoices we create via QB online. Also, can’t access any payroll features that we’ve been paying for. Thought the app was companion to QB online. Guess not. 4 stars remain."
Very much helpful. Thanks quickbooks!!! Your the best!!! Only suggestion is hopefully i can also view on mobile app the quantity on hand of my products... thanks for making it easy for me to manange my inventory!! I love quickbooks i use this on my 3 branches 😊😊😊
Good but won’t take my money. Every time I put my card info they charge me $1.00 and then it says subscription canceled. So I put in my info again and agin and they charge my card $1 but it never runs so I can be a member.
Love it. Still can't enter bills. Bills are strangely missing.  Can do expenses.  Otherwise very nice program on my phone!
"Barely acceptable. Tldr; Tracking work and getting paid are either impossible or broken via the app, but are functional in the online app, mostly.

There are major features lacking in the app: you cannot add delayed charges from the app, invoices generated on the web are present but not *visible* in the app!

Your customer asks you ""what do I owe you"" and you pull up your fancy app to show him only to get an error that the invoice was created on the web so you then waste time to dig it out of your email, all the while feeling like a fool for agreeing to a perpetual subscription for incomplete functionality.

This is your life with QuickBooks Online. 

Accepting payments via app is a chore: to simply select your customer (which you must do for each payment) entails several annoying steps:

1. Load payment screen (two taps)
2. Tap ""select customer"" (no in-line search!)
3. Tap search *button* to reveal search bar 
4. Tap search *bar* to bring up keyboard
5. Tap the customer

How could this critical workflow be so poorly executed?

Receiving payment is the actual purpose of QB right? 

Since most businesses have more than a screen-full of customers it might be a sane default to just start a customer search as soon as a payment is selected, saving 5 taps. At least focus the keyboard to start searching when you tap the search icon, saving 3 taps.

Speaking of getting paid, though not directly  related to the app: QuickBooks payments is a broken product, you send an invoice with a balance forward and your customer has no option to pay balance forward, so you're stuck explaining to customers that the bill they just paid is not the *entire* bill, awesome."
"HORRIBLE - CANNOT SIGN IN - CUSTOMER SUPPORT IS A JOKE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. I ""upgraded"" from my QuickBooks 2009 Simple Start (which I loved) to a monthly subscription for the QuickBooks Online Simple Start version. For the last 2 weeks, I cannot sign on using the Windows App. It keeps telling me that the password is wrong. IT IS NOT! I KNOW MY PASSWORD! I went ahead and changed the password to attempt to gain access. Even after going through that process, it will go to the sign in and I enter the new password and it will still not let me in and it continues to tell me that it's the wrong password. Everything works fine on my iPhone and iPad Pro apps and the web browser version. I still need in to the Windows app version though. There are things that can be done there that cannot be done anywhere else. 

When you search for a tech support number online, I was given a toll free number (855-633-1777) that was answered by foreigners who look up my account and then tell me that they can certainly help me but the tech support is a pay service and I will need to pay them! WHAT? I DO PAY EVERY MONTH. YOU WANT ME TO NOW PAY YOU TO BE ABLE TO SIGN IN TO YOUR SYSTEM THAT IS NOT WORKING. THIS IS NOT AN ERROR ON MY END!! WHEN I REFUSED TO GIVE MY CREDIT CARD INFORMATION, HE REFUSED TO HELP ME AND LITERALLY CUSSED ME! 

I found another number for QuickBooks customer support (800-488-7330). It is RIDICULOUS the hoops you must jump through just to find a phone number for these goons that I am paying for a service that i cannot use because their app is messed up!!! The man that answered the phone this time was at least a US citizen that could understand my clear English and I did not have to repeat me email address 6 times and spell it three times like the first phone number. However, he was certainly a complete jerk with an arrogant attitude of, you need me, I don't need you! This guy was absolutely impossible to talk to. After a few minutes, he muted the phone on his end and pretended to hang up on me. I waited for about 4 minutes but he was NOT going to stop playing his games. I finally had no choice but to hang up because he clearly wasn't going to assist me. I tried calling back but now it was after hours and they were closed! This has not been the best 2 weeks with Intuit QuickBooks. I do not get aggravate easily and I NEVER write reviews. But I am very aggravated now and I will write reviews for days if it will help to keep someone else from going through this nightmare with this company that very clearly has no concern for it's paying customers."
Useful time saver of expense tracking, but.... Very helpful in organizing expenses immediately post point of sale. However, the app is very slow to load and process commands throughout the process. It appears to be writing records to a server after each line entry instead of when completely finished entering an expense transaction. When you are in a rush, the last thing you want to do is wait for this sluggish app to process before heading to your next task. Makes you want to skip the hassle instead of being diligent in your expense tracking efforts.
App doesn’t work on iOS 11. Don’t waist time
Helped me simplify. I use this to send estimates that turn into invoices immediately with a few quick adjustments (my decisions - otherwise it's a simple one click). I have it automatically set to accept Credit cards, Bank Transfers, or they can send a check. Once you set it up the first time and make everything look how you like, it's automatically way easier to track everything and even send all transactions even via phone. I'm using my iPhone 6s to run my whole business now.
"Excellent Program & Service. As a small business owner we never have enough time. QB makes account quick and is very easy to understand. $15/ month (which is a tax write off) is a great deal. Think about what you'd have to pay a CPA to complete all of this paperwork. My accountant can easily sign in at the end of the year and get the necessary information. The customer service line is MORE than helpful. I've thought about going to QB training classes but there is no need to pay someone else to teach you about QB. With their helpful videos and attentive agents I've been able to learn and understand the program quickly. 
I've gotten 2 other business owners to use QB and will keep spreading the word!"
Super App for accounting. Super
Easy for someone who knows nothing like Jon snow. I hate book keeping. More than anything in life. I have been forced to do booking keeping for reasons I won’t go into but I digress. I have quick book pro and self employeed. I suggest you get this app and or cloud based software in the start of the year. It’s easier to move bank info over.  I won’t go into how great qb pro is since this review is not about that product. This app is amazing for on the go work and tracking. It makes my life so easy. I can track everything and send it to my accountant easily
Recommended. Fantastic App, very handy and easy to use
"Not pleased. I put the QB online app on my new iPad thinking I wouldn't have to lug my laptop around the country anymore.... It does not have the functionality or settings I need. I cannot input bills from other contractors on the mobile app!  They have a loooong way to go... it’s still clunky and like the CD desktop versions severely mentally disabled cousin. 

LAME........"
"QuickBooks: decent ideas, horrible execution. The app is OK when it works, which is less time than when it doesn't work. Intuit is nothing more than a bloated corporate bureaucracy that has a relatively captive audience, so it's unlikely they'll do anything to improve their products until people start leaving them en masse for alternatives like Sage or Xero.

Some of the ideas within the QBO app are good, but when your customer can't pay your invoice because the Intuit systems are ""temporarily unavailable"" all day long, you're going to have a cash flow problem.

Even aesthetically speaking, the app is cluttered and tries to pack too much into it (except for the stuff you really need to be there). I am an accountant and will stick with QuickBooks until my last client migrates to Xero or Sage, then I'm leaving too and won't look back."
Great app. I travel constantly and this app allows me to keep up with my bookkeeping wherever I am
"MGRM. Great app. Useful and easy to use.
Sample and easy to use"
Hate it. Accounting manually with a ledger would be quicker than this program. I officially hate this program and will be changing to another accounting software in July. I have been using quickbooks since 2000 and used to love its simplicity but it has become time consuming and harder to use. Make a mistake...can't fix it. If you are away you can't access all the features using the app - you have to find a computer and log on. App is garbage and pay run screen won't scroll so you can't edit anything like hours worked, for example. Reckon looks like a really good alternative. Maybe quickbooks should have consulted keychain when they developed the app. If you thinking of quickbooks for your business...DON'T DO IT! Every employee  of quickbooks must have given this a 5 star review.
Love it so easy to use.. What a great app simple to use and the support is there if you need. Would differently recommend it to anyone who runs a small business.
Great app... Needs some work.. There’s no way to record a sale without attaching a customer to it. Also, there’s really not a place in the app to keep a ledger. If it had these 2 things, it would get 5 stars from me, but as it stands I give it 4.
It's a trap!. I've used QuickBooks and it's nothing but a trap! I understand if you make a great product people will beat your door down wanting it however, in the case of quick books I think most people would like to see them beat down! They make you pay a monthly or yearly fee to use their product and god forbid you are even close to late because they lock you out of the accounts, slow the program down and just make it very difficult to use their product. It's almost as if they are so worried about their money they'd much rather see a business fail then working. In my opinion, QuickBooks is no better then any other money hungry book keeping app that is only in it for themselves and money and trust me from personal experience, they couldn't give a rats rip about you and your company! Customer no service is just that.. worthless!! This is just one business owners experience but I'd be very Leary !!!
"Not useable in multi-user environment. Here we go again, another update and still no fix to Locations and Classes.  Intuit must be the worst software company on the planet.

So in April Intuit ""reaches out"" that a fix is on the way.  That was 5 months ago!  I stand behind my criticism.

Still a 1 star.  What is wrong with Intuit programmers?

Yup, yet again another update, and still not useable in multi-user.  My business has more than 1 user account.  Locations and Classes do not work in their accounts.  How many years will this take to fix a bug that has been present since day 1?

Another update and I stand behind my previous review(s).

Seriously? Another update, and still not multi-user friendly.  But, oh boy, something works with Apple Watch.  When will Intuit fix the multi-user issues?  Someone else mentions they fix bugs.  I can say the exact opposite - they leave bugs for years!

I want to use and like this app. I've looked at every update since the very 1st version.  It does seem to be slowly improving, but is still not useable for my company."
Power super app. Superb..safe my time
Unfinished app. You guys shouldn't have launched an App with half the major features missing.
Turnover. I just really want to know how much I’ve turned over this month. Can’t see how to get this easily in this app. In the desktop version it is on the desktop. Can’t find anything about this
JE. I would like to see journal entry feature added to the mobile app. I use this app as well as the online version for all of my clients. It would be nice to be able to perform all of the same functions no matter which I choose to use.
Charge by Stealth. I downloaded this app to try it out. Before I knew it I was being charged $4.99 per month. My understanding is that it is free with in app purchases, but I never subscribed to this. I abhor these types of sneaky apps. I recommend you don't download it, or if you do, be very careful.
"QBO has Miles to go.... QuickBooks online is so erratic, and so full of flaws. One thing works one day and then the next day wont work. Consistently new types of things – supposedly to help users – pop up on the screen but just cause delays and inefficiency. I would think this was possibly related to weak Internet service, but it's not because other softwares and apps are functioning as normal on the same servers. Hopefully QuickBooks online will someday I get all the multi tiered bugs out of it software system… i'm a very frustrated user. My wife and business partner just chimed in, ""that's two of us""."
Can't add split checks. The feature to add split checks is completely broken. It works well until you have more than 5 payees on the same deposit. At a certain point, the app refreshes itself making it impossible for you to finish adding splits to a whole deposit. Very disappointed and making the accounting aspect of my business a nightmare. Intuit you are a good company and I know that you're capable of more. This work is sloppy and amateurish, which is very surprising and disappointing.
Works seamlessly with desktop version. I love that I can use the app to connect with clients while I'm away from my desktop with ease. The ability to send an invoice in the moment has been great to keep me on track while I'm on the go!
"Don't like it. This software is clunky and difficult to use. The page that opens first on the app makes little sense. The terminology used in expenses does not apply in Australia and I have no idea what some of it means. The invoicing section is awkward to use. I tried another type of this software called ""self employed"" (another app by the same company) which seems better and easier to use but it also uses non Australian compliant wordings. I found a reason not to use that either. Why do they have two apps which are basically the same but slightly different? Hence more confusion. It would be better to streamline both and turn it into one app as both are meant for a self employed person anyway. Why does one have an auto logbook but the other one doesn't?"
So much that's so wrong. This rating is for QBO overall, because the app lives in an infrastructure.  QBO is rapidly becoming the biggest POS in the accounting world.  Not sure what they’re trying to do, but it isn’t producing a usable set of books.  The app is just a small part of the collapse.
Left hand doesn't know the right. When I switch from logging in online to the iPad or iPhone, the app doesn't seem to be updated with the new information. Case in point, my credit card was hacked so I had to update my account info on all my subscriptions that used that number. I received a notice form qb that my account was suspended. Apparently it isn't possible to update the subscription info from the app, so I did it online. Now when I open the app it still says my account is suspended. One of many glitches that exist between the app and the online experience. Needs to be streamlined!
Wow, did this app save our business. We are in Florida and have had no power or internet for over one week. This app saved our real estate rental business. Everything you can do on your desktop, you can do with your iPad, using this app. All customer data is stored on the cloud. This app is mandatory if you get hit by a disaster!
"Best Business App. QuickBooks has definitely made running my business much more efficient and has made it easier to close on deals. The estimate tool makes it easy to send professional looking estimates to clients, and with a click, those estimates turn into invoices. You can receive payments through QuickBooks as well. Add the payroll service and you can run the whole business yourself.
I would definitely recommend this to any new business start up."
Excellent on the go apps -- for small business. Easy to navigate .
zenith. Great app for small biz
Learning curve and then it's awesome.. Takes some getting used to but I've now got it and it's actually very useful and easy to use. Integration between my PC and iPhone make it easy on the go and sitting at home. Estimates, Invoices & Expenses all in one app.
Great compliment to QB Online. Been using QB for over 10 years. Recently switched to online and added this app. Amazing ease of use and highly functional.
Doesn't send invoices. My customers stopped receiving invoices from me via email. I have to send it to myself and forward to them. Customer service is a joke: they think their clients are stupid, their advices are just ridiculous: Are you sure you put the email in the right section? Really? I had been sending invoices via email before and they all received them.
"Priced higher than the performance. This app does a lot of things well. However, basic things like connecting accounts are a nightmare of inconsistency. I've spent the better part of an hour simply trying to connect checking accounts that are all at one bank in to my app. It worked one time and let me connect one of my six accounts on that connection but wouldn't let me do the others. After that it wont connect using the same established connection.

So many cryptic errors or connection issues, so many verifications of the stupid I am not a robot despite that I already did Touch ID and text verification and user name and password to get in. Every single time they error out, i have to redo the captcha bit with the pictures. Which are the worst.

I know that once it is set up it is an ok experience, but the setup is a nightmare that is representative of a free product not one that costs me a monthly subscription."
QB makes me look good. QB app is fantastic. I can write and present an estimate right at the job site or give my customer an invoice, or accept payment. In brief....it makes me look good!
"A pretty good app. Update: They added deposits! It does everything I need now, upgrading to 5 star!

All in all, this is a pretty great app. It does just about everything I need it to while on the go, but it is missing one key piece of functionality. It does not allow the recording of deposits and that is really important for me. 
Other than that it functions flawlessly and has never given me any trouble. Overall, I love it!"
Great App. QuickBooks Online works really well, fits my needs as an independent consultant. The mobile app is great for keeping me current on the fly.
Great app!!!!. I am a simple tradie and this app has made life so easy! Not complicated easy Fast and effective.
Missing a major key demographic.. Although a good application, there are some things missing - like the ability to do business income taxes for T2 (Corporations). This feature should be able to send those docs to CRA in a format that ready to go. Especially when small business corporations are being targeted in the media. Help make this easier - there's no reason this feature should not be incorporated into the software.
"Slow, expensive and with poor support. I have been using Quckbooks for a year now. It's terribly slow on here and also on the pc, the support is dire, and mostly just does not respond. 
The only thing that happens quickly in this app is the removal of service if you fail to pay your subscription.

AVOID! 

Now I'm looking for an alternative that I can migrate my business info etc to without too much fuss."
Amazing App!!!. I really enjoy using this app to get my money in order!!
"App shows incorrect transactions. Transactions do not match the selected vendor. 
Works when you have few transactions. Once you pass 20k it becomes slow and inaccurate."
Quickbooks online. I wish the app was easier and more full functional but then the whole online product is sorely lacking relative to the old offline product. saas makes such a difference for SMBs but intuit has missed the boat on the cloud-based solution. Ugh!!
"Small Business - Excellent App. My experience so far with QB online and the apps have ben excellent so far.
The website and apps have seamless integration and connects to your banking accounts easily for reconciliation.

Pros
Simple, easy to use (and working) app and web pages that allows easy customisation
Future development suggestions
Would love to be able to add/edit photos for items on device/app and not just on web-page
a customisable item for unique items such as surcharges (% of sales based) would be good as well.

No regrets with the subscription."
Needs some work. This app is good but needs more work.  Error message kept popping up while working in it.  Some tasks are missing like entering bills.  Can't find sign out button or switch to a different company.
Love QuickBooks App!!!. Great App. Allows me to conduct business while on the road when computer access it not possible.
"Excelente App. Melhor sistema e App de controle financeiro que já usei.
Infelizmente vou ter que mudar de sistema porque agora estou precisando controlar estoques em vários depósitos diferentes e ele ainda não faz isto."
Great App. I have to switch from another Accounting software to quickbooks and every thing is easy to use and easy to navigate.I use it on my phone,desktop in the office.I wish I had it ever since I have been using the other accounts software.
Good expense tracker. Good for tracking expensing.  Everything else really needs to be done from the desktop version.  Handy little app, but it needs some work to truly run things from this app.
Save the password!!!!!. I use QuickBooks only once a month, the great news is it gets updated multiple times in between my uses, the bad news is the updates erase my save password every. Single. Time. When I signed up for QuickBooks online I let safari suggest my password as I do for most things so it's not possible to remember it (very cryptic) and I shouldn't have to. I will be cancelling my subscription to QuickBooks if next month I have to re-enter my password after the next update. I basically only use it to print out invoices, I'm sure there are other invoice apps that have their stuff together (without a monthly subscription) if I need to switch.
It's a good app. Very convenient. The mobile app isn't perfect, and as some have pointed out a few features are missing in the mobile app. But QB is convenient. I can take payments, check accounts, and do basic things while I'm out and about. It's good, and QuickBooks online support has been great lately.

"Ash C. I find the app is very hit and miss sometimes simply logging in is a issue! There are features missing such as adding bills and the slow speeds often cause simple tasks to take an unacceptable amount of time. The QBO system is rarely able to update banking transactions on the first attempt and can take up to 7 days with numerous attempts before the transactions will download. Other issues such as the VAT section being inaccessibility for an number of days also happens on a regular basis.

Contact with the tech team normally involves explaining the issues a number of times to many different operatives before final giving up and hoping they finally sort the glitches out in their own time!

I will be looking for a suitable alternative that does not hinder my booking keeping."
"Easy to learn. Easy to learn good support. I would like to be able to upload invoices sitting in my iPhone PDF or iBooks app, or even better, directly from my email attachments, into the QB app when I am entering expenses. Currently I only have the option of entering a photo.

Best wishes,
Dee"
Mobile app yes. I love being able to use the mobile app for quickbooks. You can't do everything you can online but it's great being able to knockout some tasks on the fly and I can show results in an instant, which is a good motivator.
Great app but could use some improvement.. This is a great application to have access to while on the go. If it would update the profits and losses more accurately than I believe this would be well worth 5 stars. Overall a great app.
Awesome app. I really like this app, I can track all my incomes and expenses, it shows my net profit and everything else I could possibly need. I really enjoy using this app.
Great App but needs better reporting. Need to see better reporting and tracking of actual sales, MRR, and KPIs
"Small business owner. I have been skeptical about leaving all my business information in an external server, thinking that one day, the software seller is not longer in business.
Intuit has given me that confidence and now I am very excited with services I have received so far.  
The program is easy to set up and easy to use. Very friendly menus. You can use as many functions you wish. Is good even for those who have little experience keeping track of business.
The only thing I don't like is that is very slow."
"Terrible Support. After a couple of years of bombarding to upgrade to online I gave in. No one explains how many features are locked down in the online version, until you migrate and start to use as a long time desktop user. 

The product itself has a lot cleaner interface. But the support for a business product is terrible. The people you speak to don't know the product, and have no means to escalate a knowledgeable person, any attempt to get a close out to a problem is impossible, they won't commit to when an issue will be fixed and once they escalate, you are in the dark. 

I want to manage my business, but since migrating to this product I feel I spend more time talking to intuit than my customers.

If someone would sit on a call and commit to close my issues, I would rate it highly as a product. But as a technical guy, clearing the browser cache is not the answer to every issue.

If your business relies on this product, I would seriously consider not bothering. I'm sure if missed our subscription then there would be some attention from the account team.

If you want to leap in the dark, then my advice is don't migrate your QB data and start afresh."
"QB has revolutionized business accounting. I have been using QB online since 2011 and can honestly say that it has delivered an exceptionally easy and effortless business accounting solution. One touch payroll and the ease of AP and AR management is awesome. I do all the accounting for my startup and I rely on QB to make it all possible. QB is continuously improving both the desktop and mobile apps to make my life easier.

So easy to use!. Such an easy app to use, These guys have simplified bookkeeping down from something I wouldn't dare touch, to being able to raise invoices from my phone and connect my bank accounts, no hassles at all.
Very good app. Easy to use. Recommended!
Awesome!. This is app is like a holy grail! ‼️🙌🏾 it works really well with my iPhone too💙💙
Great QBO App. The app works great, although lacks a few features like deleting certain transactions. QBO itself works great once you get it going, but it's not ready for prime time straight out of the box. It took me 6 weeks to get it tweaked with many many calls to support. I guess that's why you get unlimited free support, because you'll need it. The 4 star rating is because once you get it going, it works great, better than the desktop version, but I can't give it 5 stars.
Makes accounting a breeze. This app is great. Link it to your account and it quickly learns how to categorize your expenses. Then all you have to do is confirm or adjust as needed. 👍👍
Love the app!. Convenient
Easy to use. Really like the app because I can keep up with accounting on the go for my business.
QuickBooks = Easy Bookkeepping. Love the mobile app, very easy to use. Access accounts from anywhere, raise invoices, pay invoices. Simplified bookkeeping!!
Easy to use. Generally easy to use. Some limitations on app.
Not sure yet. Too early to rate this app. Only second time me using it. Ill check back in a couple of months with a more thought out opinion.
"Pretty good. This is in addition to the comments I made a year ago: 
I now discover that any Suppliers' invoices added as Bills (not Expenses) via the online system are NOT visible when they are looked up within the App!!
This makes the use of the app a very second-rate experience, only useful for adding expenses. The so-called all singing and dancing online version is still clearly a Beta version!)
It would be very handy when I'm on the move, but is IN NO WAY a replacement for the desktop or on-line versions.
Also, be aware that if QB has been used for any work between the times you've last used the phone app, be aware it will spend some (considerable) time to update the app database on the phone - so have a STRONG wifi signal or you'll be waiting for ages!
The ability to scan/photo receipts is a useful feature - but again trying to add a scan of a paper invoice, logged as a Bill, is not possible directly - as Bills are not viewable !!!"
Awesome app. Easy to use. Intuitive. Great mobile app.
Convenient. Great app now i can do the books from anywhere
Vendor and PO. Need to add vendors and orders to the app
Good App. Excellent
"It does the job, no need to look elsewhere. I've trialled a few accounting apps but none of them quite did what I wanted. Being an accountant I wanted to find a product that I would use myself and more importantly it needs to be user friendly so the non accountants can use it too.

My clients love being able to snap receipts in while they are out and and about, rather than having to find motivation to catch up with the bookkeeping all in one go at the home. 

With QuickBooks you have your accounts team with you in your pocket!

Customer service is excellent and the product is improving all the time."
The Whites. The only thing I like about the app is the ease of tracking expenses. Pretty much everything else is only accessible from a desktop or laptop computer.  Invoices are a major problem with this app.  Most of our clients don't use or don't have an email address to send invoices to. So I have to individually print each one. I would like to be able to batch print invoices, as this is how most clients prefer to be billed.  Not being able to access customer info offline is some what of a hassle, as most of the time when it needs to be accessed we are on the phone with the customer.  The online version of QuickBooks seems to be quite the waste of money.  Just buy the desktop version.
Excellent. Great app and program.
Easy. I can't believe how easy this app is to use!
Impresessed. This app helped change my business!!!!!!!!!
Meh... Large app, slow and expensive. Looks nice but loading times are slow and not all sections display properly on a phone.
Simple and easy. Great for keeping tabs on your business on the go but would love to have the actual versus budget comparison on the dashboard instead of having to bring up a report.
Very helpful. Make managing my bussines much easier. Good app.
"Good resource. I will update this as I see necessary, haven't made a customer service call yet.

But overall the navigation is something to get used to because it's very in depth and many details that you would expect are included with the software."
A***. Used a few different invoicing tool apps but nothing beats QuickBooks for doing my invoicing and book keeping. A**
QuickBooks on the Go!!!!. I love the program and app. I find that it's easier through the app since I can just take the photo right from my phone. I recommend this for anyone!!!!
Brilliant. Brilliant app keeps my business in order
Never Disappointed. Best accounting software available!
"Useful App. The App is very helpful for my business, I just which the stock category could be more detailed towards distribution more. 
But I do give the app the thumbs up 👍🏾👍🏾"
Can't live without it. The app is super handy for viewing business info on the go. I'd love it more if there were a few more reports.
Great app. This is a great app for small businesses.
QBO saved my books. This app is a great extension to the desktop, cloud based program. Everything you need in the palm of you hand and more.
Great App. Great App
So glitchy!! 😡. QuickBooks has the potential to be great. But this app is so, SO glitchy! Have CONSTANT problems with it and I'm really getting to the point of giving up and going back to Sage. Every time a problem is sorted, a new one pops straight back up. If they could employ some decent tech guys and get things working properly, this would be brilliant.
Easier than all other apps. I literally tried out a dozen other apps trying to get one free or cheap. Efforts were futile. I broke down and bought this one and never happier. It works like a charm and no dead buttons. Does what I want it to do and no limitations.
"Would recommend to everyone!. Easily the best software to manage a small business. 

I am able to invoice customers with such ease that it makes me wonder why I haven't switched software platforms sooner!

You can not go wrong with QuickBooks. 

The app is so easy to navigate."
Basic App. App functions are extremely limited, and I can't use qb web on any browser on iOS devices (iPad/iPad Pro 12.9/iPhone 7plus) as all browsers including safari, chrome and dolphin run in zoomed mode when want to enter invoice, payments, receipts and bills or even check reports and make unusable.
"Pretty good 9 months in. Really good, can't do pay roll or VAT reports on the app but just about everything else. Photo receipts for expenses and checking received payments. Very useful.

F"
"Excellent. Does what it says on the tin.. Excellent app. 
Works brilliantly on the iPad, sometimes find it a little sluggish on the iPhone but I put that down to the poor wifi we sometimes have and bad signal from phone operator. 

Anyways it's so easy to use and I can produce an invoice there and then and email to the client instantly. 

Don't know why I took so long to move from desktop to quickbooks online."
Amazing app!!!. This is the most powerful and helpful app to manage a company, it it easy and friendly!!
Best way to handle your business needs. Great app
Great app would be useful to do bills on it though. Reminder email doesn't work on app
"Working great, love dashboard. App is easy to use on the go. Some things are better done on desktop but for the most part can do a invoice from phone and accept payments.

Would be nice if inventory feature wasn't additional cost"
Excellent App. Moved from Xero to QBO and couldn't be happier
Excellent tool for my biz. Since I got this app on my phone I hardly need to go to the office, or open my laptop. Love it!
"There photo above shows signature capture, it does not have it. No signature capture debacle

Update: #2 of  8-7-17
Well look at that the capture signature button is there now. Now either the button was not there and added now Or the button was there and customer service has no clue what there doing and how to use there own product. See notes below)
Im giving ***** right here but not changing my app store stars im sorry , the customer service was ridiculous and a waste of my time. Horrible. Wow so frustrating   Thank you for responding to my review here i appreciate it. Please for love of bookkeeping train those people geez. 

Update: 8-7-17
In your response to your most recent update. All the customer service calls noted below were for the mobile app. And your help center that i guided customer service to view is geared towards the mobile app. And those are the responses i received from them over the phone. 

Update : response to developer 8-5-17
Puzzled ? As am I 🙄 
I called in 4 times about this ability to capture signatures 
First time I called the customer service person tells me, no we dont have that no you cant. Then i asked why is it your help center data base clearly stating plain as day instructions on how to. 1. Create new invoice 2. Enter all needed information 3. Click on the CAPTURE SIGNATURE. 
Also not to mention the fact the screen shot here in apple app store for quickbooks clearly shows a signature being captured.  So after lots of back and forth tells me this is a new and quickbooks company doesn't tell them (customer service) what quickbooks os doing. What!? Got off the phone didn't want to waste anymore of my time. 

Round 2 call 
Customer service tells me that its not capable of capture signatures, then after guided her to your help center where it clearly states how to puts me on hold then comes back and says that its new and there and there implementing it in in phases !? and my account number is part of phase 3 and would add the capture signature button in 3 weeks. Ugh ok i guess i can understand that. 

Round 3 

Called in again 
She also tells me no its not possible
explained my last call with customer service and stated i was checking on the the update phase. After explaining the last call i had to this customer service rep. She was more bewildered than prob you are right now reading and she to was left puzzled as was I. Then proceeded to put me on hold to research. Comes back tells me yes you can but only if you have a merchant services account through you. Hmm thats odd i thought. She tells me that the signature capture is for payment credit card. So i proceeded to explaining a plain signature capture by a customer on an invoice. She proceeded to tell me no unless you have a merchant account. Ok fine over, but before i got off i guided her to the help area in quickbooks if you search HOW TO CAPTURE SIGNATURE. It clearly says so and what she told me didn't match with what was posted on the help area. Which is CAPTURE SIGNATURE---AVAILABLE ON INVOICES AND ESTIMATES. now if your estimate is being signed i didn't know you had to have a merchant account AND I didn't know thats industries standard to run a credit card transaction off of an ESTIMATE.  

In the end puzzled as you are and pretty much moving on to another service unless you can find someone that knows what exactly is going on over there at Quickbooks. That i will end up speaking too someone that knows what there doing and what there talking about, i will not call and waste more of my time . And by the way your web browser version of quickbooks online on a mobile device does not load correctly the right side is cut off making the invoices or anything you do on there useless Im on an iPad 12"" pro. Doesn't matter what browser you use same prob, try using the app instead but cant as it lacks all the features the browser version does. 
So any way you cut it. No signature capture something so simple to do. 

Please let me know what you think of all that, im trying to be helpful here as I expect better from quickbooks your industry 

See your help instructions below 

Capture signatures using QuickBooks Online for mobile

Open a new or existing estimate or invoice.
Add any transaction info, as usual.
Select Get Signature.
Let your customer sign with their finger. They can always clear it and sign again.
Select Done (Android) or Save (iPhone/iPad).
You'll see the signature on the estimate or invoice. It's that easy!  

Update:   7-27-17

There is no signature capture on invoices even though they tell you there is there is not. It only applies through tak ing payment by credit card transaction through quickbooks. Something that is so basic to business the leading book keeping company can not provide. Walk into customers store drop product they sign the invoice received! Thats It! Nope not quickbooks so pass them up. Plus thats not counting time hours and hours of lousy customer service and back and forth till they finally fessed up to it. Don't waste your time."
Great app. It seems to work great! Other then it not auto saving when I close the app, that is the only complaint I would have. Everything else is awesome!
Good. Good apps
Decent....but needs work. The mobile app is laid out decent and does work well for the most part.  Biggest problem I have is you cannot access product quantities or make any purchase orders with the mobile app.  Need to fix that.
Missing key functions. Whilst I understand this is a mobile app, even the QBO version lags behind in key functions from its desktop predecessors, all of which Intuit has had ample time to upgrade to fully integrated functionality. Intuit needs to put full functionality above the profit margin and put customers above dollars.
Great app. Thanks
"Just barely ok.. App has multiple issues . With page format. Browser must use google chrome to get all options .
Called 3 times , on phone over hour each time . Weeks later still nothing fixed . 
App is very limited ..
Customer service is a joke .
Here i thought i was upgrading to a better software .

Lol i was so wrong .."
Awesome App. As a small business owner I'm constantly on the go. This app is amazing. With very little effort I can quickly add a new client create an invoice and get paid how I want.

"Can't add unit with quality and rate in invoice. Online version does not allow customisation of fields. Invoice doesn't show ""unit"" with quantity and rate as a result invoice are unusable in real world. 
Hope developer address these issue at priority before we users move to other applications."
The best mobile app for business I've use!. Quickbooks mobile app is the best app I've used for my small business. It has everything I need at my fingertips. Thank you intuit.
Tremendous. Great app been using QuickBooks over the years on desktop version specially go on mobile is the best way to go there is a couple tweaks that need to be worked on for example keeping track of inventory etc. and so forth been using QuickBooks Pro help ticket update these features as QuickBooks from other than that it's a starter
"Excellent on iPad, good on iPhone. I use this app on my iPad and iPhone, it's pretty good on the iPhone but it's darned good on the iPad.
Hopefully they will develop more features on both over time as it's still not a total replacement for the web browser version."
QB. Use it for my farm.  Fantastic app
"Not Quite a fully independent solution yet.. There are many features still missing in this app to make it a complete accounting solution for any business. For example, there is no way to enter purchases of assets. Also, its not possible to enter a bill without paying it right away. What if your company does not pay its bills one by one but instead pays multiple at once. 

Many other features are lacking and this app cannot be used without its windows or web portal yet. I believe that Intuit has always suffered in making an application that is reliable. They should concentrate on fixing their current version of the software before trying to create new versions and different platform app before having one versions that is stable and does what its supposed to do. 

We are using Quickbooks because the company has been using it since the beginning and because it would be too much work to change all of our hundred thousands of items to a new solution.

But over the years we suffered from file corruptions, to quickbooks creating its own archiving transactions creating havocks in our entries that were archived and multiple tax audit because the software limits the way some entries happen. 

By the way, even if you don't have anything to hide, never give the government access to your Quickbook file, they will question every entry, even entries that were entered by mistakes and reversed later. They don't look for the reversed correction for the mistakes. 

Suffice to say, this app is not ready to do what the full version of the program does and is in no way a replacement for computer desktop in the accounting department, services department, parts (retail counter), or any that runs a company with at least one employee.

I don't know who that person is who says ""Now my computer usage is 99% iOS..."" but let me confirm that it's now because of this app.

Patrick M."
Ease of use. Being able to utilize the app on mobile has made billing my customers so much easier for my transport company. Editing and immediately sending invoices for quick pay is a great option as well. I've been a QuickBooks user for 20 years now and will likely not stop anytime soon.
Great work!. The app works great and is a very useful tool for on the go business matters. I have not yet figured out how to add single time activities on the app ... not sure this feature is available. But other then that it's great!
"Need price levels. This app is ok but it's been out for a while now and we still do not have pricing levels. It has been in the works according to QB for almost 2 years and we still don't have it plus I can't go back to desktop program because data will not import properly 

NEED SOMETHING DONE ASAP. YOU RAISED THE PRICE BUT CANT GIVE US WHAT WE NEED!!!!"
Statements. Can't send statements or use bundles in the app. Email customer services about it and they send you a email about doing it on your desk top. Been asking for 6 months to have it added to the app. Just get the same response while they add useless gimmicks to the app.
It gets better and better. I was a huge sceptic (I have been a pro advisor for several years)and very had a very negative opinion of QB online. That was until a couple of years ago when I attended a presentation of the capabilities of the software. I was sold on its usefulness and have been using and recommending it ever since.  QB online adds important features regularly. Buy it!!!  You won't be disappointed
"Seems great so far. This is what I've been waiting for so I can invoice my jobs right on the spot.

A few months on and yup this app is amazing works perfectly for what I need."
"MGRM. Great app. Useful and easy to use.
Sample and easy to use"
Great App/Limited function. It is a great app. Wish it had full functionality. Payroll within the app. Not a extra app. That only works. If you want Ituit to handle everything. Need to work like accessing from desktop. Writing checks should also be there. Plus running reports. But it is a great app. With limited function. Has gotten better. Just wish it was getting there faster.
Cant wait for more transactions so I can use the app again.. So easy to use. I look forward to using it again and again.
Brockton Driving School. Great App, keeps my business manageable on the go.
Nice work. Each revision makes the app even better. I did not appreciate the price increase but if the service continues to improve then it is valuable to my organization.
Major Flaw - can't run payroll or attached from Dropbox. 3 stars as you are unable to run payrol on the go or even view payroll - employees wages which is a major part of this app that is missing. Also when uploading attachments you can attached anything other than a photo. No links to Dropbox etc which again is a major flaw
Good app and great support. Easy to use although experienced problem with VAT rate not being editable in online desktop version. Intuit' response was really quick and efficient and friendly. Highly recommend.
Great app. Love this app
Quick books. Love this app. Very easy to use!
Great app. Quickbooks have a fantastic app with full functionality of the browser version.
JP contractor. Great app for full business functionality and ease of use. Price is a a bit high
Great app. It is what it is. It an app. It won't have all the features of a computer and you should not expect it to. Does exactly what I need it to in the field.
Excellent app for my business. Works wonderfully!

"Why the bad reviews?. This app has made my business work 90% more economical! I don't waste time printing my invoice manually, paying for an envelope, paying for a stamp, having to got to a post box, wait for them to receive it, wait for them to send a cheque back etc etc etc. Love it. Something's are a bit weird on it and sometimes confusing but when you get used to it it's great. Would be good if they provided a ""quickbooks for dummies"" demo program or such like to make it easier to learn and help you use the program to both yours and it's full potential."
CIS Unfriendly. Useless if your a contractor or subcontractor. If your in the Construction industry, this app is useless. You cannot create CIS invoices which renders this app useless.
A small business must have. I have used Quickbooks Pro for my small company for many years, but I can't believe I have gotten this far without this app.
Excellent. Wonderful app to use. Very handy when working out in the field. Easy to get on the phone with a live person for any and all questions.
Poor app not intuitive. Some features are good, but (and it is a big but), the desktop app does not work, the web app is poor and the iPhone app almost forces you to make errors, which you can't seem to undo. This is a waste of money. If the app were more intuitive and flexible then you'd have a winner. For now you won't be putting accountants or spreadsheets of business.
Very convenient. App is great when you are not in your office.
App CRASHING Multiple Devices  (iOS 10 & iOS 11). I use this app for my business and after the last update the app has been completely useless on my iPad and on my phone. The only way I can log data is by sitting at my computer when I get home from work. Please fix ASAP. Using FreshBooks until then. Thanks.
Helpful software, terrible customer service. The QuickBooks software is helpful to any small business owner. Especially if you are in the service industry and you're merely provide services. The software itself has many other helpful features and it really has helped us gain an understanding of the finances of our business. The one issue that we have is their customer service while friendly is not very helpful. We have had on several of occasions where they cannot solve a problem because they either don't have the technical know-how or the staff to do it. I'm not speaking of the actual accounting portion but rather if there were technical issues with the online software. We have gone weeks without answers to critical questions that we have for instance why none of our clients can receive emails from the online portal.
Needs timesheet support. Price went up 100 a year and still no timesheet support outside of desktop app
Love it!. Best app for my business!
Great tool. This app helps me keep track of my business finances and at the click of a button I can see who owes me money or who I owe money to. Really useful!!
Best app. Love this app makes it easy for me to track all my buisness transactions. Recommend
"Good but frustrating.. No access to Vendor information or Purchase Orders on an iPhone or iPad. Have complained about this for nearly 2 years. Falling on deaf ears. They agree that it would make sense but there is no one that gives a *%!£ to do anything.
3/13/2017 Have now a problem accessing QB Online since yesterday. Download company on either the iPhone or iPad takes an hour or more and on certain devices never will. Customer service doesn't have a clue what is happening. We have all gone multiple resets and all other aspects of the devices operate correctly. 
Extremely upsetting on an extremely busy Monday.
4/4/2017 We are still stuck with no access to our invoicing. We were told that a review was coming out today. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS USLESS!!! We are looking for an option to change to at this point. 
7/27/2016. They have been making periodic changes that for the most part just cause us to get use to small changes that don't relate at all to the items we have been concerned about for over a year."
"QB for IPad IS NOT as good as SERVER Versions. I have been a QB user all the way to Enterprise servers and have now moved to their ""online"" platform in a subscription basis and have found their iPad vérsions, Mac apps etc to be VERY Lacking in functionality.

The constant answer is we are improving all the time and those items are on our lists, well, if you knew how users used it with server based versions then why did you create such a lacking program using an app.  Pretty incredible to me.

You will find there are lots of things you can not do on an iPad, such as enter and paying bills as a start, pretty basic in my mind so you can only image what is missing that is less basic.

If i could i would change programs to something else but i need to spend the time to find the better option."
excellent app. couldnt ask for more! all my paperwork centralised in my pocket!
Keeps crashing. I can't do anything with the app. Every time I try to open it, it closes out about 5 seconds later. Worked great until the last update.
Very disappointing. They frequently change the interface and items move or get hidden. E.g. Customers formerly in the dashboard hidden in sales. Frequently I quick on a document on a list and the wrong one opens. Lists open in various formats for unknown reasons. My favorite- lines of invoices disappear when I switch browser tabs to get more order information. Hard to believe quickbooks has such a good reputation.
"Many Features Needed. The app does not match the QBO version as well as I'd like. There are features not available on the app, such as the option to apply a discount before tax rather than after tax. QBO allows me to toggle that option. The memo box is only a statement memo so the only option to have a memo show up on an invoice is to add it as a line item. 
I am over all happy with QBO and the convenience the app adds for our mobile business. I do think it's overpriced considering there are a few key features that got lost between desktop and QBO, and the translation between QBO and the app. My techs are experts on the app and I am an expert using the computer interface. But there tends to be miscommunication when I ask for them to make sure they 'finish' an invoice come to find out they can't because that is not an option on the app. We work around it and pray for some updates :) while researching other options that also include dispatching options."
Needs work. Glitches, freezes all the time, constant updates asks me to review app while I'm using app so annoying
Slow to respond from time to time .. The app is sometimes slow to respond.
Essential to running my business. This app is very helpful, highly recommended
Great app. Love to have access to our invoicing and payment details wherever I am. Super easy program to use.
AES. Great app, worth the investment
Great product. I like this app. Can use from just about anywhere
Great!. As a first time business owner and user of any accounting software, I am very happy with QuickBooks on the whole and this app in particular. Easy to use and understand without over simplifying what needs to be done. Seamless integration without just about any software make this a great go-to for all your small business accounting needs.
Fantastic job. Intuit made an extremely versatile, and well-run app/program with this version
"Diasappointing. As a long-time desktop user, I was led to believe the online version was the same product with additional benefits.  Don't be fooled, it's not the same product at all.  As others have said, the online version feels stripped down and costs more.  Also, impossible to customize many reporting features in online. The QB apps are even more limited than the online version, the app is basically useless.

Intuit has done a very poor job of pointing out huge differences between desktop, online and app versions of QB.  I'll be going back to desktop or migrating to a true, full-featured online solution."

Not intuitive, not flexible, once in your stuck. Terrible decision for a simple accounting software. Converted from computer version...very unhappy.
Very useful app. Very useful app, works like a charm
Horrible app!!!. Online service seems to work good but use my phone a lot on the go!!! Can't do any billing from app anymore!!! Really hurting disappointed!!!! Who do you talk to about this!!!! I give the app no stars
Nice app but not fixing known issues. This is a really good app and I would give it five stars except I keep getting an error message when opening up certain accounts from the chart of accounts.  This has been going on for months and Quickbooks knows about it and doesn't fix it.
Horrible. Could not be more frustrating. I tried to subscribe to the online service and even paid for it but I keep getting a message that my free trial is ending. I can't enter a customer when entering expenses. There's no way to enter a credit card payment or credit. I've done extensive searches for answers online but my program doesn't have any of the functions described. I will call them tomorrow when they open and hope they can solve the many issues. Extremely unhappy with this product and service.
Rejected Xero and Wave. Wave is excellent, especially the receipt OCR, but it can't handle payroll in Australia. I had Xero for a previous business but, now, they have priced it out of the ball park for small businesses. It's simply too expensive.  Quickbooks is ticking all of the boxes for my business so far...both the app and the desktop. Early days but, so far, the interfaces seems well laid out, stable, intuitive and easy to use. I'm trialling a MinuteDock integration, being a consultant charging by the  minute, so I hope that works as it should.
My everyday app. Love how easy this app is to use
I recommend for on the go companies. I have been using the app for a year and it has work great for me no downtime and easy access on my phone. Great app!
"Keeping my desktop version. Update: 7/12/2017: App doesn't let you customize your invoice settings. The app is limited so you have to use the online version at times. Once you subscription is over the app makes it hard to renew. Ive tried it for 6 months and its been real difficult to run a business with limited features. 

I have used quickbooks since 2001. So I love quickbooks. Save a lot of time on accounting side of the business. 
When I was making the move from a Windows based laptop to Apple (ipad) for my mobile business, I found this app to be very low on features. Simple tasks like sorting a list, inventory, and reports were poor and lacking. 
The online monthly subscription is a joke. You have to opt for a more expensive subscription to gain features that still pale to the desktop version. Long term, it's cheaper to buy the real program. Plus all your personal financial and customers info won't be out in the web as much. 
The web version of this app does not inner exact well with a iOS web browser. 
That being said, I bought a windows based tablet and install my desktop quickbooks. I have no monthly fee and I have all my info not floating around on the web."
Quick and Easy. The mobile app makes business life very easy!
Mobile app. Convenient and easy too use!
Couldn't do it without this app. Love this app. Sooooo mobile friendly!
"New to qb app. Love it, but needs a ""statement"" tab"
Love it, I use it everyday for my business. QBO has helped my business grow buy looking professional, keeping up with invoices, and giving easy ways for the customer to pay.
Don't make me log in repeatedly. It's an App.. UX execution for this company is repeatedly abysmal. I have an account. I download the app. I activate thumbprint authentication. And they repeated log me out and have me sign in again as though I'm a new user to a web site. This kind of crap UX plagues this app in the most annoying spots.
Great app. Thanks
Nice and easy to use. I have try this app. As a startup owner, it is very good to generate estimate & invoice
Not quite what I'm looking for. After the Invoice2Go update disaster, I read a lot of good things about this app. Sadly it fell short of expectation as I was unable to change the invoice number, which I would think was a pretty basic requirement. Advice on the internet seems to relate to an older version of the app as the information did not relate to what was on the screen. I won't be utilising my free trial, nor will I be subscribing.
Perfect for construction guys. I'm always running from job to job and the mobility to give estimates and invoice is on the spot is priceless... Plus the customizable terms for each builder/customer with the added alerts helps me stay on top of receivables
"Work well.. This app works as promised. I would like to see a few changes.
1. Taxes should be calculated via location. As it is now you have to specify tax zone and amount. 
2. The credit card collection portion takes a very long time and does not integrate as well as expected into the software. I would hope that processing could be reduced from 5-7 days to 1-2 and the transaction charge could come in with a split showing the cost. While I am here...on the transaction label it comes in the same as the monthly bill so you have to be careful to note what account you post the expense to and the auto match feature does not work on there own product. 
3. Very small but important. The iPad, phone, and computer have quite different navigational feels so it is a learning curve for all three not feeling as natural as expected but very user friendly. 
4. Okay on more small desire. I would like a ""remember me"" feature for my phone so I don't have to type my password in every few days. My phone is highly secure and all the protection I feel I need when accessing via that interface."
Good app. .
Great App. I was reluctant to make the switch to online, but now I'm glad I did!  App is awesome and quick. Great for small businesses.
Much room for improvement. If it were free, it's a great product , but as a paid program and app, it could use a good deal of user input towards improvement
Nice app. Nice app, quick and easy. Smart invoices and bank matches. I don't like PayPal, so wouldn't use that payment option.
Makes Accounting Much Simpler. I've been using this app for a few months and find it to be really easy and accommodating. The app when used in conjunction with my desktop program helps to alleviate a lot of ambiguity and oversight.
Help. There doesn't seem to be a way to tie in purchases on to a invoice to charge specific customers. When you call in for help with the  app, customer service does not have access to see what you're looking at.
Must have for small business. I love the app is easy to use and easy to monitor business finances
Bookkeeping on the Go. I own a small tax and Accounting firm and this app has done wonders for customer service! Being able to give my clients real time information from anywhere at anytime is a huge plus!
Love it. Love it. The version on my computer is great. This app is a little unintuitive but if you understand what you're doing it's not bad!
QBO in general needs work. This app is limited in what you can do. QBO was rolled out before they were finished developing even some of the most basic features.
Like the format. Good app
Best Mobile Accounting App. Great improvements in the latest version. Easily the best iPad/iPhone app for accounting, that sits well alongside the full featured QBO software.
Amazing app for a small or medium business. Very user friendly. Don't have to be an account to enter data, app allows you to do everything on the go.
Great app and accounting. Excellent accounting software and a great app as well. Nice work QB!
The most buggy app on my phone. Ironically this is probably the simplest App on my phone since it only adds and subtracts, and it's the most expensive app on my phone considering the monthly fees. But it's also the most buggy. Intuit has a near monopoly on this market segment and they behave like monopoly as far as the quality of their service. First and foremost touch ID does not work on this app. On the Intuit help boards I can see that this has been the case for almost a year with no fix. I can't see how they can claim that they offer bank level security when this basic feature doesn't work. Also, this is the only app on my phone that regularly need to shut down because of an error. Proceed with this app at your own risk it will cause endless frustration. In this case you don't get what you pay for. My free apps work much better than this one.
Useless. App is slow and hard to use.
Too expensive & not easy to learn. I added some photos of receipts last night first time using the app. Now I can't find how to look at them and edit information connected to them. Too expensive especially for how hard it is to understand how to use. I don't want to bother waistline my time to use software I can't afford. $40 per month is ridiculous just sell me software I can load into my computer and use with an app on my phone that is one lump affordable price
"Incomplete. The mobile app is not very useful compared to the online version, missing so many functions!
Like time sheets and billing be with them!"
"Construction co.. This program is awesome. It allows me to keep all my books squared away. Balances with my credit cards and my bank account. Also the customers can pay online with the invoices and receive their own paid receipt. I have a choice to allow them to pay with their bank account to the my account or, a charge card. And if I want I could add a 4% convenience fee.
  This program is awesome it covers everything from payroll, subcontractors, invoices, estimates, bank transfers, bank balances, you can even keep inventory and many other things on this program. That do with a business.
There is no better program out there than this one"
Great. This app helps my small business tremendously. Very easy to navigate, enter and retrieve data. Very affordable.
"Needs a lot of improvement. Missing a lot of features and information available with the web browser connection. 
Can't see vendor history. 
Can't sort how inboxes etc are listed. 
A few other issues. 
Freezes often. 
In the middle of invoice entry, the system bounced me out for some reason, while not saving the work I had entered to date. Did that twice. Before I closed out and went to PC web connection. 
I love the possibility this app offers, development need to fix and enhance"
QuickBooks app. I find this app to be the most useful app on my phone to run my yard care business due to be able to add jobs that have been done right on my phone to make it easier to remember what's been done
"Fantastic App!. I can perform easily 90% of our QuickBooks administrative work on the app version. This allows our business to save time and money!
Way to go guys!"
Great Bookkeeping Tool but app lacks features. QuickBooks is the absolute best Bookkeeping app out there! The full function web app works wonders but the app needs to be updated to include most of those functionalities.
good app. goop app
Good app. Nice to have this access on the go. Works fine for reviewing status and basic functions.
"Not great. There are multiple problems wrong with this program.
You can't bill a customer when you attach a receipt which means I constantly have to switch between devices. 
My expenses according to the customer are incorrect.
I'd like to see my estimate/invoice minus my expenses per job.
The only reason I switched to this program from FreshBooks, which is way less expensive and more user friendly is because Quickbooks has a balance sheet, which our accountant required."
Easy to use. A simple easy app that keeps everything in one place
Can Not Do Custom Invoice Numbers. The app can not do custom invoice numbers. I have had the app for two months and paying the monthly fees and have not been able to send out my first proper invoice. I have asked support and they come back with instructions to go to certain settings that do not exist on the app.
Gets the job done. Very helpful app. Works well. No issues that I have experienced.
"Efficient App. As a bookkeeper I use QBO for all of my clients as well as for my personal account. It just keeps getting better and better. Accepting transactions is a breeze as is setting up invoices, paying bills, and writing estimates. One feature my clients find helpful is the receipt attachment. 
I would highly recommend this app for anyone who uses QBO."
Excellent for small biz and freelancers. As a freelance artist who travels a lot, this app (plus online access) suit all of my accounting needs. Easy to follow after you've learned the basics, and love doing my monthly books while on the subway. Has clients and books all in one place. Helpful to see who owes money and to track income flows across each year. All the reports are fantastic. Best accounting software out there, worth the investment IMO.
Great app. Absolutely awesome tool for my company
A small business must have. I have used Quickbooks Pro for my small company for many years, but I can't believe I have gotten this far without this app.
Statement from app ?. Works great for me but I wish you were able to print off a statement from the app. With all the updates lately. Why is it so hard to be able to create a statement from the app? Not the biggest deal in the world but very inconvenient. So a lot of updates lately and still no way to create a statement from the app. This really is very frustrating.
"Great app that needs improvement. Well we've been using QB for 8 years. The Desktop version up until the beginning of 2016. Then-
We we're sold the online version on all the positive points - tablet linked access for multiple users- time tracking- cheaper monthly payment - payroll simplicity - etc. 
We we're not told about the lack of features compared to desktop version. Nor the slow app functionality and constant downloads of data/updates- along with app signing out without warning- also app will crash without warning - especially if network is slow / lost. 
Overall we like the app and the system. 
We need the facility to send letters to all customers or the ability to export customer addresses to a word document- on the PC browser 
Also the customer services is good if I'm focusing on customer services access and speaking to a person quickly - but - technical support is poor - with many operatives guessing and pondering - like ""try this"" or ""hmm I'm not sure - I'll speak to my manager"" ESPECIALLY WHEN ASKING QUESTIONS ON THE MOBILE APP. It's as if the call center is not communicating with the app developers . 
We had a major issue a few months back in where non of our employees including myself could log into the mobile app - all we could see is ' data download, please wait' - 
I called technical and they knew nothing about the problem but did state that an updated app is being developed and will be active soon. 2 weeks later our apps started working again. I complained about the inconvenience stating the loss of time and added aggravation and cost to ourselves as we had to revert to paper and pen 
The customer support team offered 6 months reduced subscription fee as a gesture of good will, which we appreciated as kind customer support . 
Overall a great program and very efficient when working .
I suggest the ability to change invoice templates from the mobile app as I have templates that show itemised item costs as well as non specific invoices with a total cost only - I would love to be able to switch between templates from the mobile app to save me having to go into the office ."
Does what I need. App is easy to navigate and has all functionality I am looking for.
Easy to use!. This app gives me the leverage I need to stay organized.
"New ""update"" totally crashes - it only gets worse!. I personally like the iPad app better than the online version for interface, but it has so many bugs!  Constantly gives me error message that I'm not authorized to do something (add/edit a customer, etc.), but then it lets me do it.  But I keep having to close out all the error messages that pop up.  Often won't let me email an invoice.  Won't let me add customer off of creating a new estimate (have to add customer, close, then do estimate and choose customer again).  The list of basic things that should not be an issue goes on and on.  On the iPhone app, there is no place for my reps to view the contact person's name at the company!  I'm sure there are other things I could think of, but I've just learned to compensate and work around things.  However an app with this many bugs should not be out there - it's pretty pathetic!

UPDATE 11/18/15 - after update, all the previous bugs are still there.  Pathetic to issue an update and not fix what was wrong!

UPDATE 1/14/16 - even worse!  Now I can no longer add an item to an estimate or see the customer name on Estimates or Invoices under ""Activity"". What is wrong with you people?  If you can't make it better, leave it alone! Now it is completely useless!

UPDATE 11/7/16 - I absolutely HATE you for forcing me to upgrade to iOS 9!!!  I have been suffering with Quickbooks iPad's pathetic bugs for well over a year.  I am forced to use it for my job because my laptop is old and I hardly ever pull it out anymore.  Everything I do is on my iPad.  However, I have an older model (not by years, but by model) and after the mess updating to iOS 8.3 created for me, I vowed I would never update again!  NONE of the other apps on my iPad have forced me to do this.  App developers are generally sensitive to the fact that not everyone chooses to disrupt their life by updating their device and spending days having to learn to use it all over again (and deal with whatever new bugs it brings to the table).  You must have the absolutely lowest level of developers out there who first, couldn't fix even simple bugs in your app (like telling me every time I set up a customer or did an estimate ""I wasn't authorized to do it"" and then warning me if I got out of it all data would be lost.  But it wasn't and everything I did was still in the system.  Even our boss got this message and she IS the administrator).  There were a myriad of other quirks we had to work around and now your solution is to release a new version, but in so doing force everyone to upgrade to iOS 9 because your developers weren't smart enough to know how to make it work with previous iOS versions???  Shame on you!  You would get 0 stars in my review if I could and if this new version isn't totally bug free, you will REALLY hear from me!

6/28/17 - So a month ago I finally successfully upgraded my iPad 2 to iOS 9.3.5, which is the last version it will update to.  I did this in order to be able to use QB on my iPad.  It had its occasional crashes and freezes, as always, but otherwise was working OK until today.  Suddenly, total crash and won't open at all.  I've uninstalled, hard reboot, and reinstalled several times to no avail.  Then checked the App Store and see they did an ""update"" yesterday.  Typical.  They just cannot seem to leave well enough alone.  The thing has bugs and flaws enough, but they only seem to be able to make it worse, not better.  It is unbelievable that a company like QB cannot hire a better technical support staff to develop their apps.  My company is planning on switching to another software soon and I am so glad!"
Mrs. App will not open after update
They just keep changing the app.. My biggest complaint about the app is the limited features on customer entries. The PC version you can enter a customer as tax exempt on the phone you can't. further if you open the customer information on the phone and save it it will clear the tax exempt status on the PC version as well. So it is a constant battle to keep who is and isn't exempt straight.
Good if it's working. Tedious authorization every time you have to reconnect with your bank. The desk top app isn't quicker and it seems to crash at the most crucial time!
Great app. It's a one stop accounting app for me and it's made my life so much easier having it.
App crashes. Everything was great until one day the app crashed.  Now crashes every time I open it.  Reinstalled and same issue.  Help????
Simply outstanding. I'm floored by the convenience and utility of this app. Good work, Intuit!
Getting there.. This app was the absolute worst waste of time when it was launched. But now they are syncing the interface with the browser based app and it's very useful.
Great!. I've used QuickBooks for years. Very happy with the online. version, it allows me to take care of my invoicing anytime anywhere. My business is more profitable now because I can send an invoice when the job is complete and there's no forgetting to do it at the end of the day. If your business is mobile shouldn't your accounting be also?
Still no progress invoicing!. Great app for running a business on the road. I wish it had progressive invoicing...
Solid for Business. Great App for a small non-profit. Easy to navigate and I appreciate the prompts!
App. Best account app
"Some good points. Some frustrating points too. Stop logging me out for one. 
Taken a while to get my head around it, invoicing seems to be quite easy now. I'm not impressed that I can't do my payroll from this app, that's frustrating."
"Limited functionalty. The app has limited functionality, can't see transaction details of any expenses and income accounts; can only see the assets and was told to use the browser version.
Can't drill down from a report to see the details of the transactions.
Touch id login is handy.
So it's better to just use the browser version."
Great support but app is flawed. I have several companies setup on one login. This was done by QB themselves but it keeps crashing, stalling or telling me there is a fault. Also don't choose 'other' as business type as list of income and expenditure categories is massively reduced and you will have to add the ones you want manually. Customer Service is excellent but I shouldn't need to know this!
What a joke.. Can't add notes to customers. BUGGY! Cant print. Awful. If you are moving from QB desktop, think again!  There's not even an easy way to just view today's business. No reports in app. Useless.
Best QuickBooks I have used.. This app does everything for your business it's quick it's easy and fast so I recommend this to anybody
"Worse accounting program. You have to go through multiple screens for a simple tasks.  There is functionality in the app that's not available in the desktop which is unusual for an accounting program.  Automation and ""how to"" help menus are nearly non-existent."
Time saver!. We recently had a glitch with the program in that our Quotes and Invoices weren't displaying correctly if sent from a Tablet. QBO support walked us through the problem and made the changes to the back-end templates until it was rectified. Invoicing and quoting should never be a burden. We are happy with the outcome.
"Still a ways to go but the upgrades needed are so simple they only get 3 stars. So it's Quickbooks..it iChat is folks. Theo line version has come a loooonng way since the creation of it. I've now switched from the desktop version to online. But just simple things that the desktop version does that online can't or won't make you really scratch h your head.

I have two very different businesses, hence I have two different logos. But QB online only allows one logo. Really!! WTH...don't suggest the invoice template to upload a custom logo invoice. It's a total joke..

And speaking of total jokes..you will be inundated from Intuit when invoicing to turn on their ACH and credit card online payments. Inundated!! Until you finally decide to do this..then, you'll be prompted to fill out a credit app and expected amount of charges. If you don't make the grade with QB, I.E. charge enough every month you get a nasty rejection letter stating you've been turn down for bad credit....seriously, you simply can't make this up. I called them, incredibly offended and angry as I have perfect credit only for online customer service apologize and acknowledging that was offensive and a mistake. You were turned down simply because you don't bill enough as a small business. 

Folks, QB online works. But you have been warned about its inefficiencies."
Excellent solution. Moved from QB desktop longtime user 9+ years this app and the online approach work really well.
Great, Clean App. Although it's yet another expense for your business, it's well worth every cent. More of an investment for us and we use it for four different companies (yes four times the subscription fee). Regardless, it will manage your company's finances as they should be. Leaving you with less hassle and worries about your accounts and more time to focus on more important entrepreneurial things.
"Need app to send estimates from mobile devices. Looking for way to send estimates from phone when away from office.

I have been testing this QBO out for a week, this in no way replaces desktop version.  Currently not willing to quit the desktop version.   There are a few apps out there for free that create estimates/ invoices, But don't sync with QuickBooks.  I had high hopes that this would be the answer, even willing to pay $20 for the app.    But when I found out that I must choose between desktop and QBO, and that I have to pay a minimum of $15/ month........    I just don't do enough outside business to justify $180/ year 

Quick books needs an app for estimates that syncs with desktop.  Been using desktop for about 3 years now."
Good functionality but slow to load. Great functionality, good app but it takes too long to load. I don't need the homescreen with current activity to load each time. I just want to add an invoice.
"Purchase order. I like the app it's a good app there is one screw up and a big one I wonder if it's only me who uses it

Why can't I make a purchase order on the app ???

Other wise it's a great app"
Slow to respond from time to time .. The app is sometimes slow to respond.
"Getting better all the time. Still needs tweaking.. I use this app for my business every day, and the mobility is excellent. Saves so much time in paperwork.

I've been waiting for a couple of fixes for a long time:

1. There is no way to change whether a discount is before or after tax as in the desktop and iPad versions (it's locked to discount after tax and to change it requires logging in on another device to make the change).

2. I'd love to see a couple more report options, particularly Invoices by Month as on the iPad version.

Other than having to log in on another device for these things, it's solid and I'd encourage anyone in a similar business (service industry) to use this app."
Syncs to Everything!!. Awesome app. I'm using QuickBooks for my personal accounting. Saves a ton of time. Intuit's phone and online support is terrific as well. Couldn't recommend this app highly enough.
"QuickBooks renew account??. Renewed my subscription for a year and I'm still locked out, every time I log in it keeps telling me to subscribe for 1 month  I tried to go that way and it asked if I wanted to change my current year subscription? Makes no sense.. wish some (tech support or program owner) fixes it I'm about to cancel it all.....

WY small business owner"
"Ok when it works.. This app is ok when it works but if intuit is having issues, they will never admit it and they will leave you hanging for up to a day or more without help!

Not worth the money."
Stop downloading.. I have redone load company data every time I log on the app which can take hours, and essentially makes the apps convenience useless.
Subscription Errors. Nothing but problems since January. I switched from the download to the App so I could do it at home and it's been nothing but problems, and not even the same ones!!! I have 2 companies, it's June, and I'm still trying to get this straightened out to input this years data.
good app. very detailed , im no pro @ accounting but i am teaching myself this App.  its very in depth and i like it.
Glad I got it. I got this app when my computer crashed and it was the best thing that happened to my small business
Makes life easy. Great app that makes accounting on the fly so simple.
Landscaping on the Run. Always busy. Not a lot of time set aside for paperwork. I'm loving the convenience of this App
Not bad however. Could we have a fingerprint scan to open the app as a measure of security please!!!
Favorite app. My favorite app. I use it on a daily biases to send invoices right after I complete a job. Makes my life so much less stressful.
Miss E HUGHES. Fantastic resource easy to you & amazing customer service.
Amazing. Amazing App
Great app. Excellent app, does exactly what I need with no fuss
Easy to use. This app is so quick and easy. My business is on the go all of the time and it makes estimates and invoicing so quick and easy.
Just as simple as we could even think !!!!!. This app according to me is best as it's not that complicated and makes my business easy, I've not used any other accounting app so I consider this very easy for any layman who is not very good in accounting. It could have had few more options like individual job closing so to get more accurate and decrease the paper work.
"Easy and efficient!. The app serves perfectly to capture transactions on the go, snap a pic and enter amount and accounts then review later if needed on a computer. Simple, some people expect this to be fully functional for
Some reason; if you need a fully functional program Then you really should have the appropriate expenses towards computers and software anyways. This app makes the book keeping process easy as cake for clients and the accountant."
Love it. They fixed the errors I was having. Great app now.
Very good.. We've been using this app and have been very impressed with it.
Very disappointed. I was doing the free trial of the program and I was very excited of all the features it offers, it would save me a lot of time. However; when I try to insert a new customer on the app in my phone, it does not go to the quickbooks online that I access through my laptop. This was a huge turn off for me, that even made me reconsider if I want or not to purchase it. I can not trust to send estimates on my phone for over 100 customers and have to get back and hope it is on the system or have to insert all of it again. Another thing that got me worried is if estimate and the receipt of a payment disappeared, imagine if it happens with an invoice. I can definitely loose money if the system has errors like this. If you guys ever solve the problem i ll be happy to be a customer because I need a system reliable and to make my life easier.  Also when they sent me an email asking how did the customer support did, the email was a non-reply email...I wonder, how are they getting my feed back if they do not even care to send me an email which we can communicate back and forth.
Really Great. Only complaint is that attachments from the web app don't show up in mobile.
Quick Books App. Absolutely love this app, its works fabulously well on my iPhone. My only gripe with the app and it's operations is that not all of my customer emails that are sent are being received by my customers. I have highlighted this to Quickbooks and they were extremely unhelpful in assisting with rectifying this matter, which i found extremely disappointed given this is a paid subscription service, and not a free service.
App. Grate app worth purchasing I'd recommend this to anyone
Work in progress, work not yet completed. Very convenient and functional tomorrow to add expenses and receipts on the go. However only expenses not bills or other random transactions can be accessed through the mobile app. Hoping Intuit sees the feedback and that all transactions available including bills to be accessed on the mobile app. Please add bills to the mobile apps.
Excellent mobile access to finances. Recently my laptop crapped out and just before, I moved from the desktop application to QB Online. And I'm glad I did! The ability to input expenses, manage invoices, photo receipts, and keep my bank account balanced on my iphone and ipad are totally worthwhile. Most important this application allows you to import your desktop past transactions - several years worth in my case and they made it into the app without any trouble. A note for new users on mac. QB online's database doesn't support downgrading from Plus level down to Simple Start without some customer service haggling. They were able to accomplish the feat - for which I give the customer service team alot of credit. Happy customer so far!
Excellent accounting app. Invoicing to my customers has become very quick and payments entry are the coolest which I found. Secondly the one year 70% discount is the main which attracted me. I hope this discount continues I also go ahead with this accounting software app. The negative is that I am not able to connect to my local bank in UAE for reconciliation.That's all from me. Thanks for giving me opportunity to write a review.
"Add a little more. New to the App. ( 3 months ) it is a perfect fit for my little contracting business, customers seem impressed when I ""whip out"" the I pad to invoice them after a service call. Especially the sign on the screen part. 

 But on the vendor/bill side, a couple of more functions would be very helpful. Mostly entering bills, in my business I have multiple trips to suppliers, so so I end up with a bunch of non mailed ""invoices"", it would be great to be able to enter them real time on the fly. Right now I can only do it via web view and sign in with font that is too small for me, as is the speed via cellular data, not near as convenient....so the receipts pile up for the week and entering them becomes tedious. 
Five stars from me if they can add the enter bills function."
Good product. Use this for small business. Works good for all basic business functions. Updates have made it even better. I enjoy and appreciate this product.
Bad program. Won't send estimates and invoices. Buisness cash flow Has been screwed up.
Great small business app. Love this app for my working vacations!
Awesome. Awesome app! I use it for my landscaping and turf management company.
Super awesome tool. Best app you can get so you have total control over your accounts
"Pretty but not functional. It's bizarre how the graphics continue to be improved but the functionality doesn't. I've been trying to use this app for years but the features I need on the go are missing such as timekeeping. Mostly this app seems to work a lot like you would imagine Quicken mobile to work, by being able to look up past banking transactions. But I can do that on my banking apps for free already.
Update June 2017
Still nothing. Super big blind spot, but the costs keep going up."
Awesome. Love it , great app.
Stops unexpectedly. I can never really depend on this app because it shuts down unexpectedly. I can't really get anything done on the mobile app.
Best for small businesses on the go. I'm a CPA consultant that specializes in accounting systems and QB and its other products QBO are the most popular in our Vancouver market. It's popular simple to use, has good built in reporting, and lots of apps. And it's adaptable for virtually all small businesses.
Amazing. This app is amazing work flawlessly
No bad. There are several things that are better with the app and qb's online, however the lack of personalisation with the invoicing are rather pants and why the system doesn't have a clocking in facility for employees yet is beyond me could be done easily through a simple app and gps no?? And then integrated into job sheets
Business. I'm very happy with this app help me a lot
"Love the desktop version. The app needs work.. Limited functionality. I can't even update the credit card I use to pay QuickBooks in the app. 

Tough to send invoices to clients"
Great app. The App takes a bit to get used to but once you've played with it a bit it's very simple to navigate, update bank transactions and so on
I love it. I use this app and software everyday to organize and manage cash flow in my business. I don't know what I would do without it!
Phone. Phone app is better than pc version
Great App. I love working with QuickBooks I can take it with me anywhere I go and makes everything with my business that much easier. I have used other apps that were good but they didn't tie everything together like QuickBooks. I highly recommend it.
Great Features. Great features but would love if I could do sales receipts (and attach photo) and credit card refunds on the mobile app. Everything works great and it's very nice having the option to use the mobile or the desktop.
"Beware price increases.. I love the functionality, but I've had two price increases since becoming a subscriber to the online service.

The entire point of a subscription model is so that the company has a sustained income in order to continue developing and my costs stay fixed every month.

This isn't acceptable so I'll be looking for other solutions soon."
App lacks functionality. Info being offered isn't current 2017 information. Try looking up purchase orders per vendor and it displays last years (2016) scattered information. Not very useful... This app is only good for sales invoices and P&L reports. That's about it. And who's to say that stuff is even current without double checking with the online database from Your computer. Payments: Unreliable- looks like I'm sticking with the GoPayment app. Just another step to my day to day book keeping tasks...
Great App!!. Accounting made easy, great interface and easy to use. Highly recommended.
"Job costing would be great. My only complaint is that I don't have the ability to truly categorize expenses and income by the job.  I use the locations feature, and it is a decent work around, but not quite as seamless as other software.

I love the app for field access!"
Very Pleased Client. I love this app. It has saved me so many times. There are a couple things you can't do on the app that you can do on the desktop like change your payment information but I have no issue with that. Thanks Intuit for another great product.
Good software. This software is very awesome. I work for the company but also use it for my own personal budgeting and it is extremely helpful but there are still a lot of bugs that need to be worked out with this app so that all the information updates correctly.
All you need to run a business.. Awesome app. All your accounting needs are build into the app. Very easy to use.
Great app overall. Great improvement to the app. Can pull up a lot of information on demand. Still need some better viewing of bank register on the app. Also need to be able to click on expenses in P&L to drill down into the detail. Still a great app, but areas to improve.
Amazing app. Everything in one
Helpful. While not a fully functioning mobile version of QBO, this app is great for checking up on things.
Needs to fix bugs. I love QuickBooks online and the desktop version but their mobile app needs to fix their bugs. I told QuickBooks support two months ago that I couldn't email an invoice from the app and they couldn't help me fix the problem then. I still cannot send invoices from my mobile app so it is basically useless to me.
Great app. Very nice and good
"Very useful and convenient ever ready business tool. I was a little sceptical about migrating from Paper and spreadsheet records for our small company accounts. Our accountant advised the move and it has been a huge success. Easy capture of expenses and bank transactions, instant views of the business via the dashboard are not powerful and easy to use.
Some things are a little confusing for the non-accountant, but the user interface has steadily been improving over the 18months we have been using the online system and the Apps."
Great when working. This app is a great app , however every time that Apple do an update it seems to cause issue in regards to the program recognising that you have a up to date subscription
Great App. Easy to use very helpful!!!!!
qb app no good!!!. QuickBook Online is fine where as the app has only limited features!!!
Non Emergency Medical Transportation business owner. There are obviously some differences between the desktop version and the app. The app gives you real time overview of everything you might want to double check on the go. QuickBooks is a great tool and the app is a great extension of it.
Fix needed. Over all ok program... the problem is you can get an error, saying deposit on hold.  Not your problem as a user, the user did nothing wrong. And QuickBooks will not fix it.  Your account balance will be off and no way to fix it.  All QuickBooks fault and they don't care, support it or fix it!  Very bad customer service!!!
Glitchy software loses emails really crappy support. Issues remain for years intuit does not fix. Loses emails all the time invoices say sent when they are not.
Convenient & Helpful. As a new business owner and usually overwhelmed with just running the business, the app and website make the financial and tax side of the business easy to stay current and accurate. Once I got the initial tax required and payroll payments set up, it's made my life easier.
User friendly. QuickBooks has saved me so much time and stress! I have a small business and tried excel and failed miserably. But when I switched to QuickBooks it took me no time to figure out it could do everything I needed and more! Also the customer service is wonderful, anytime I have called for help because I'm terrible at technology they walk me through step by step without making me feel stupid. I'm so happy I switched to QuickBooks!!!
Supper great and easy. This is a time saver app
Major Flaw - can't run payrol. 3 stars as you are unable to run payrol on the go which is a major part of this app that is missing.
Great app. I have been using QuickBooks for about a year now. It's has been a major asset to my business. It made filing my taxes quick and easy too.
Great App. The most recent updates made this app amazing. It is invaluable in my business. There are still some tweaks to be made but overall I give it 5-stars.
Best App for Small Business. Excellent
"Awesome, 70% of the time. It's an awesome app, but needs work.  It's nice to have the mobility.  However, there are frequent quirks.    

- edit an invoice.  Works only 70% of the time.  I frequently have to wait 30-60 mins to hours to change an invoice.  Being a service company where we expect payment right after service... having invoices that are not editable is tough.  I edit, try to save, then get a screen which says new info exists.  No new info is saved.     

- client payments aren't always credited to an invoice, although they're paid thru each particular invoice.  

- etc.  

- these things happen regardless of cell strength.  

- Sooo...  Nice to have but glitchy."
Great app. I love this app. It's very helpful and easy to use. Keeps everything organized and in order easy to look up at any time. I highly recommend it for all small businesses. It will definitely make your life a lot easier.
"Amazing for my business. I wouldn't know where I would be running my own business without this app. It truly gives an ""on the go"" experience and aided with other tools I can work anywhere in the world. Thanks QuickBooks!!"
Indispensable. The package of apps for Mac, iPad and iPhone is perfect for my business. Saves hours of my time.
Best app ever. I've used QBs for a long time and it gets better every year.
Quickbooks Online Plus. Loving the new updates with invoice tracking and the ease of excepting credit cards in the app.  Getting paid is easier and quicker than ever.
Great app. Great app for small businesses
Great idea, but not full version. As a long-term user, I expected more from the app than it has. I still have to use my PC for some of the essential functions such as Payables, Reports, and Payroll. Disappointed!
Great app. Good app. Better if it had tracking of vehicle km like the self employed version
Good app. Some glitches need to be worked out but very nice app to use and very user friendly.
"Expense management isn't there yet. The app is SO close, but 2 stars because this is a major hassle. Expenses that you input and assign to a customer are not marked as billable and there's no way to make them as billable. They're always input as nonbillable. 

For me, all of the expenses I assign to customers should be billable, so I have to manually go through them at the end of the month in the desktop version to fix this (which means I sometimes miss them). Just having a ""billable"" field on the mobile that carries over to the desktop would solve ALL of this. 

Alternatively, adding the billable field to the main expense view on the desktop, or a report that showed billable vs nonbillable expenses would also fix this."
Awesome. The app provides an excellent opportunity to update all expenditures to find out exactly what's in my bank account anywhere I have signal for my phone.
A1. Great saves money time talks to my accountant, does estimates, converts to invoice Simple
QuickBooks. Great accounting app, been using QuickBooks for years now and it keeps getting better. I would be lost without it. So easy to use with great tutorials. I'd highly recommend.
Great app. Nothing like doing invoices from the phone!
Awesome App!. Best way to keep your finances organized!
Must have app for any business!. Easy, fast, comprehensive and dependable. Makes the handling of my business a breeze.
Work in progress, work not yet completed. Very convenient and functional tomorrow to add expenses and receipts on the go. However only expenses not bills or other random transactions can be accessed through the mobile app. Hoping Intuit sees the feedback and that all transactions available including bills to be accessed on the mobile app.
There is nothing better than Quick Books Online.. I own a Offroad Shop where we sell products and modify 4x4 Vehicles such as Jeeps, Trucks, SUVs, and even UTVs. I have been using Quick Books since 2011 but switched to Quick Books online in 2013 and haven't looked back since. The lay out is so user friendly even for someone like me with little computer knowledge. On the rare occasion when I couldn't figure something out for myself the tech support people were there ready to help me with great customer service. and I modify 4x4's for a living and now I am also able to modify QB Online to meet my exact needs. As my business grows and I need more help with payroll and other things QB Online is right there waiting for me to use it to it's full potential. I haven't found anything that I couldn't do with QB Online yet and I don't think I will. I highly recommend it!!
Great. Great app easy to use and all but needs a mileage tracker/ logbook like the quickbooks self employed has
Useful app. Adds a lot of useful abilities to your mobile device.  I'm not a heavy user of it, but I have not had issues with it for months using the basic features.
Best accounting app except for some glitch. It is the best accounting app that I had so far. I like the inventory part. What I don't like is that the activities for the suppliers are empty but with the web and desktop app the activities appear.
"Great app unless you have employees you want to use it. (Even after the recent update that seemed to target the below issues, non of them were resolved). 

The app works great if you're an administrator but if you have employees you've set up as users who you want to empower to add expenses directly into Quickbooks (for example), which is a super basic feature that is 100% described as possible by Intuit, you're out of luck. They are unable to see accounts when they go to attribute an expense to a particular account (or a Class for the matter) and the app doesn't let them add an expense without attributing it to an account. And then, even though you wouldn't want employees to do this,  if the employee tries to add a new account in the app in order to add the expense, Whyte told they don't have permissions to do so. 

It's a bug for sure but a very big one that 100% cripples the app for those users. I can't believe this hasn't been addressed yet by a company and an app as big and established as Quickbooks. 

Please fix this asap!!!!

** I appreciate the reply to my review but two updates later and one of which supposedly targeted this issue and yet the issue persists!"
MGRM. Great app. Useful and easy to use.
Great company. Starting up a new business has been a confusing journey. QuickBooks has helped me get through a lot of the pain of how to take payments and handle expenses and such. Would definitely recommend.
"Long time user, good goals poor implementation.. This is not Full QuickBooks if your a long term user, it has select features only. Maybe one day it will get there but it's not there yet. Business owners beware.

I've been using this for about a year. I switched to the online  platform from local user so I could use it on my different devices while in the field and keep everything in sync in the cloud. I had also hoped to allow my technicians in the field to enter their time online without using a third-party service anymore. Although the concept is wonderful the actual service is below par at best. But it is slowly getting better.

Pros: 
- Online sync,  when you're on the Internet it will sync with the cloud most of the time. (Not always).  
- The ability to make a estimate on the fly and then accept a payment is fantastic. 
- Ability to add vendors on the fly
- Ability to sync with your accountant online. (Read cons)
- Ability to Update a invoice in the field and send it to your client. 
- ability to have your team log time online, additional services required. 
- Words with a lot of existing Intuit Services, I.E. Bill.com

Cons: 
- It only works when you're online!!!
- Beware it makes your primary system completely useless if you're off-line. They claim this is not a issue. I can tell you from lots of experience and multiple calls to their technical support team it is completely a known issue. 
- You can't do everything on the mobile or iPad Pro as they claim or even half the features of the laptop version.
- Accountant support has increase, Since switching to the online version I have had to double the amount of meetings with my full-time accountant to keep things working like normal. It provides a easy to share system with your accountant which they keep updating about once a month. Maybe they'll get it right this month!
- Check your bank support First! I had to switch banks because when QuickBooks updated their online system last year they made it completely unusable with certain credit unions in the SF Bay Area. 
- I have been charged 3x for the same service, monthly, yearly and monthly again. So watch your intuit charges.

Although it has its issues overall it does work pretty well in general. But it has about 30% of the features of your old full QuickBooks! If you love your QuickBooks it's not ready to switch over yet."
What a joke.. If you are moving from QB desktop, think again!  There's not even an easy way to just view today's business. No reports in app. Useless.
Great software all round. QuickBooks is easy to use and manage. Software and app work easily together. Makes small businesses life simpler. Love being able to use app to do expenses and invoicing on the go.
Why isn't app as easy to use as actual online. The online version is so much easier to navigate. I don't like that the app and the online version have things in different places. It makes it much harder to locate things. I would rather have one streamlined version to use on all devices.
Not good. App and site are actually kind of bad. Slow to load. Not enough options. Will try Xero soon
Andrew. Great system and good app. I have been using it for over 2 years now. However, there are some downsides which they couldn't rectify even after reporting them a few times. Maybe I expect too much, but: you cannot upload PDF and sent it by app (eg. T&C to add to the quote), emails I sent to customers supposed to by coming to my inbox as well to keep track while sending quotes directly from the software, not happening anymore.. and some small loops while sending template msgs. But honestly, the best app and system for me so far.
No other compares. No other accounting software app/program compares or gives you the power and knowledge at your finger tips.   Great app.  Easy  to use. Tons of features.  Perfect or managing your business on the go!!
Dispatcher. I can actually keep up with calls now with this mobile app
Great app!!!!. Very happy with the app works great and allows for same functionality as desk top
Love it. I've used many online accounting platforms and this is far the best. The app is amazing.
Nice App!. Suits my needs...
Great accounting software. After using QB software for many years, I switched to QB online as a happy customer. I advise QB online especially if you are in wholesale trading.
"Good Accounting Software. I've experimented with Xero,Reckon,Myob and various accounting Apps but this is best of the lot.

It connects to your bank account transactions
and as you enter your expenses it automatically 
matches them making Bank reconciliation a breeze.

Once you set up your customer list it's so easy to select one and see what they owe you and also to look at costs for that customers job.

The Supplier List is good and you can see where your at with a particular Supplier at anytime.

Customer Service is fast and you get very detailed answers to any Query.

The only thing I would like to see is more customised invoicing.

I like how you can add as many receipts photos and notes to each customer

 Happy with the program so far."
"Desktop to Online. I run a construction company. I am on the go constantly, I also tried staying with QB desktop as long as possible because that was my comfort zone. After 4 years of everyday desktop use I made the switch to online. A little getting use to it but once you understand its web based and the use of the apps you will love it.

The construction software I use integrates with QB online so it was a no brainer once I was fully setup with it.

Only 4 stars because it's a little clunky, sometimes you get delays and bumps but if you use the desktop app its much better. It can only get better imo

The pros far outweigh the cons. My whole team is thrilled we switched as we can all work at the same time with ease."
Great. Love this app. Some glitches but overall great.
Not bad, but needs improvement. This app is good but needs improvement. Improvements are mostly needed with the bank connections. I have to constantly tell my clients to update their login information in quickbooks for their bank accounts. This makes it's frustrating and time consuming for me and my clients. The app should also make it easier to do the same things as the web version.
"Poor invoicing. The ideas on this app seem great but in reality don't deliver. Linking bank accounts doesn't really work (for my hsbc business account). Other major problems include: not adding dates to individual entries for labour costs or time. 
Invoice template can't be added to or edited so you can't add add your payment details to inform clients how to even pay the invoice you're sending!? A few other issues which is really annoying- could be a good app but there's a lot to resolve before I would recommend"
Great. I love this app. It does what I need.
Works well. I'm surprised this app works so well. It's much less glitchy than the PC program
Great app. Perfect to keep track of your business accounting.
Won't let us start a new tax rate. The best app will not allow us to start collecting taxes.  Every time we initiate the tax rate and try to save it it simply says it cant perform that function please go to settings and let us know.  It's ridiculous that a book keeping app as large as qb's is that such remedial tasks are often frustrating.
"Too many missing features. Can't add time entries, even simple ones, have to pay (a lot) for a third party app.  Not acceptable for a single user company that doesn't sell products, only time that needs to be tracked.  

Can't view current ""sales"" status of unbilled items.

Can't email myself receipts and have them automatically entered as expenses

Bank transactions that I've excluded keep showing up.   Again and again.  

I'd like to configure away unused modules/functions from the menu"
Awful app.. Literally the worst business related app that I have to deal with. Get ready to log in every six seconds and have no changes saved when you modify things. The idiotic data entry fields do not allow you to enter information half the time. If literally anyone anywhere came up with a program that would import my contacts and records from this steaming pile of junk, I would switch.
Great small business tool. Excellent on a laptop, doesn't handle banks with authentication dongles very well, mobile app doesn't handle them at all. Can't do payroll from mobile. Receipt tracking is easy and works well. Reports and snap shots handy.
Four years of online QB. QB has simplified my life, given me access to billing for my clients on my cell phone and made it super easy to process transactions. I'm also able to allow my Bookeeper, CPA and salesperson access to the areas they need. The only thing that would make it better would be having the ability to print transaction reports for vendors like we can for customers.
Not bad. Categorising expenses has been incredibly time consuming to say the least.  Once you have your data in order you can start to make some decent reports but just getting over that initial hump is frustrating. Shortening load/save times along with better tabular data editing tools would make a big difference.
Quick rip for me.. I find this app so frustrating and difficult.  I have had it for nearly a year, paying for the services I can't even use.  I have been trying to cancel it but there seem to be no option on the app.  the website is asking me to trial the whole thing again.  i can't even call and talk to a person.  HHHHelp.  I need to cancel.
Quick books. Great app
Cool App. Very easy to use
Andriarad. After spending close to a decade working with QuickBooks desktop I thought I'd never switch online;however, this app has really been the catalyst for me and I am now a 100% believer in using QuickBooks Online. Having access to your QB file in the palm of your hand will change the speed and nature of how you do business. You can finally get the insights and control you need to stay on top of things from anywhere. Create new customers, call current customers, send invoices, run credit cards, check your P&L, the list goes on. If you are a small or medium sized business you need QuickBooks Online and you need this mobile app!
Couldn't do without it. The QB on line version has really simplified our operations. The ability to have multiple users from different locations, especially remote access, has made life easier.  Either using a laptop or my iPad is great when out of the office. The only thing I've found that the app does not allow me to do is prepare a Purchase Order. But, there seem to be periodic updates so hopefully this will be coming soon. I would recommend QB to any small business.
Owner. Great app
Terrible customer service and often outages. Terrible customer service and often outages. If you have a problem you're on your own because there are no numbers to call or anybody to message. It's only FAQs
Roofing company. The app is great, although it needs an update with bugs fixed. The app won't allow me to modify, save or send invoices. Very frustrating.
Zero Stars new version is Junk. I used this app several times a day. I run my business on this app. Since April 10th I cannot access my data. My business is suffering and Intuit cannot fix it. I still have to pay. Tech support at Intuit / Quickbooks recommended I switch to a Android. (I doesn't work on my iPhone or iPad) I really do not want to invest in new hardware. Stay away from Intuit they do NOT care and offer no solutions.
Needs work. This won't stay up to date with online or desktop app and I regularly get error messages. This is frustrating and useless.
"Needs a lot of improvement. Missing a lot of features and information available with the web browser connection. 
Can't see vendor history. 
Can't sort how inboxes etc are listed. 
A few other issues. 
Freezes often. 
In the middle of invoice entry, the system bounced me out for some reason, while not saving the work I had entered to date. Did that twice. Before I closed out and went to PC web connection. 
I love the possibility this app offers, development need to fix and enhance"
Still no progress invoicing!. Great app for running a business on the road. I wish it had progressive invoicing...
Improving. Intuit continues to refine the app. It will really shine when they incorporate a robust POS system that shares items across their own platforms.
Down graded. From April this app is unusable. I down graded to QB ONLINE.  It appears it was released about a year too soon. Nothing but frustration from day one. The iPad and iPhone is useless.
Good but has a few flaws. Overall this app is great for its purpose but the biggest issue is the inability to add GST to invoices. It makes the app almost useless, unless you go out of your way to add the cost of GST as an extra line item in the invoice, but then you have to explain that to your clients which is not very professional looking. Without that ability it's kind of just an expensive mileage and expense tracker (it is a good tracker though). I hope they improve this app a bit more because it could be perfect.
So helpful. I love this app seriously. It's organized my work flow life so much!
Hate it. Accounting manually with a ledger would be quicker than this program. I officially hate this program and will be changing to another accounting software in July. I have been using quickbooks since 2000 and used to love its simplicity but it has become time consuming and harder to use. Make a mistake...can't fix it. If you are away you can't access all the features using the app - you have to find a computer and log on. App is garbage and pay run screen won't scroll so you can't edit anything like hours worked, for example. Reckon looks like a really good alternative. Maybe quickbooks should have consulted keychain when they developed the app. If you thinking of quickbooks for your business...DON'T DO IT! Every employee  of quickbooks must have given this a 5 star review.
Love it!. Took me a while to get confident using it as I was used to doing things manually but now I love it. And especially love the app. Don't know how I managed before!
"Unnecessarily secure, glitchy. This is a pretty useful app except it's hindered by three main issues:

1. It requires you to authenticate EVERY TIME you switch to another app and return to QB. For example. I'm in QB, then switch to email to check what an Amazon purchase was for, and then when I switch back to QB, it requires I authenticate with a password or fingerprint scan. I appreciate security in an app, but this degree of such is absurd and makes the app a pain to use. This is my biggest gripe. 

2. It glitches a lot. When I go to the bank section to code an expense, it takes about 5 seconds to register what happened and then finally make the change. I'm running this on an iPad Air 2 mind you, not a slouch of an iPad. 

3. No offline mode. Still."
"Good. Excellent app.
Some very slight issues with layout and the occasional page that can't be used on iPad. 
But overall good. Would recommend to others"
Why bother. Why bother with the app? You get better features by using your web browser, even on your tablet. Even still, the payroll functions are very cumbersome and don't work well, so a desktop is still required.
I'd rather have a bootleg copy of 2002 QB on PC. This is my first rating of anything. I have a feeling that the folks at QuickBooks aren't done making a bad app and platform horrific. How would you feel about multiple glitches and straight up losing you money. They are a monster at that. I have been using this for about as long as it was out, and I can't take it anymore. If credit cards weren't accepted through QuickBooks, I would be gone a long time ago. The best part is the constant denial of problems.
"Constant improvement makes the product great. I'm an accountant working with small business owners.. Some are simply on board for advice and counsel others get full turn-key service. I can confidently tell them that using QBO will let them have more time to do what they love rather than what the must.

And as one who has used and recommended the product for several years, I can say that QB has anticipated and fixed every problem my clients and I have had. Their customer service has gone from painful to super, and I love that.

Are they perfect? No, but then neither am I."
"New to business and this is great. I have now completed my second year running my business and without a doubt I owe some of my success to QuickBooks as I don't have an admin person it helps me manage things also creates the professional image I need.

I prefer using the web platform but when I am on the go and making small purchases for clients I love to add the expenses to their invoice on my phone before I forget!"
So so. Hard to understand how to do a lot of things, and frustrating at times. Customer service though is very good, I just wish I had more time to work with them.
Great improvement over previous versions. Previous versions were useless.  This finally is an app that is not only useful, but a great productivity tool.  Had to use the iPad version when splits suddenly stopped working in Quickbooks Online.  Discovered the iPad app to now be fully functional.
Time tracker missing. The online version is friendlier then the online desktop version, but all in all a great app. One thing missing is the time tracker. Would be great to be able to track your time spend on a project and book it to an invoice.
"Fix finally now I can get back to work.. This Version fixed the errors from the last update.   Glad it working again.    Quickbooks has been good except the last update.  This one fixed the issue.   

We us this app for our onsite Business and it's great. Several times I would send an invoice to the customer when I'm leaving their home and before I get to the next job it's already paid.

Update. Does not work again.    :("
"Slowly losing my business. I'm about tired of this app not functioning properly. Embarrassing to say the least when I have a customer trying to pay their bill and I can't even connect to QuickBooks online server. None of your apps are working as advertised. $25/month for what again?

Vendor profile on iPhone isn't in sync with current information online. Trying to enter/view bills within a certain vendor and it's showing info from 2016."
"Took money. Loved the app until it was time to get paid through the app. My client's payment was deducted from their account 5 days ago. After providing information about my client, along with 6 MONTHS of bank statements, I was told that I should be paid 5 days from now, but according to the user agreement, it may be longer. Intuit is holding on to MY MONEY that the client had paid to me for services rendered. I'm switching to Freshbooks for invoicing, and opening a Chase Quickpay account or find some other method of payment. Waiting for a paper check in the mail would be easier and more reliable than this garbage. Like, I said, it was a great app, until it was time to get paid, which is the point of working. Their only explanation has been ""Your account was flagged by our computer."""
Slowly losing my business. I'm about tired of this app not functioning properly. Embarrassing to say the least when I have a customer trying to pay their bill and I can't even connect to QuickBooks online server. None of your apps are working as advertised. $25/month for what again?
Stops working too often!. Not a bad way to do your estimates in the field and send out invoices but your app stops working way too often for us company wide!!!
Excellent and easy to use. Fantastic app would recommend it to anyone that asks
Love this app and it's capabilities. The only feature I wish it had is to be able to see bills from Suppliers.
Zero Stars 10.3 is Junk. I used this app several times a day. I run my business on this app. Since April 10th I cannot access my data. My business is suffering and Intuit cannot fix it. I still have to pay. Tech support at Intuit / Quickbooks recommended I switch to a Android. (I doesn't work on my iPhone or iPad) I really do not want to invest in new hardware. Stay away from Intuit they do NOT care and offer no solutions.
"About 7/10. Not bad but not good.
The App keeps requiring updates if used on apple products. Not an issue but the updates never appear. QuickBooks blames apple and apple blame quickbooks.
We ""updated to the cloud version"" from a PCM based quickbooks. So far we are very very disappointed."
App keeps crashing. Even when I try to leave feedback the app crashes. No issues on desktop.
"Awesome to invoice right after service and be done w it!. So far this app is working out great for my business. Are used to dread the end of the month where I would sit down and look at my calendar and have to invoice for all of the services are performed that month. Now after I do a training session I go out to my car open up this app fill out the invoice and send it!  

I have one customer that always pays late and it's really hard to keep up with how much they owed me at any given time with this app all I have to do is open it take a look and I can see what invoices have even partial payments and which ones are still open it's wonderful"
App constantly glitches and it's very slow. I've had so many issues with this app. Lately it has been extremely slow, it randomly shuts down for no reason in the middle of inputting a transaction and it won't load larger invoices. I'm very disappointed as I use this on a daily basis for my business.
"Longtime user, app is gradually slowing down. Been using quickbooks online since it came out, and unfortunately the apps seem to slowing down more and more with each update.  I have to delete and reinstall the app a couple times a year because it hangs or acts funky.  
Hope these little issues get resolved and I can use the apps I pay a lot of money each year to use"
Get it together, QuickBooks. As a small business owner, QuickBooks is a crucial part of our daily work. Invoicing, estimates, managing our money. Since moving from the desktop version of QuickBooks, we have had a daily dose of glitchy, unreliable service while using this software. And it seems the glitches are persistent and long-lived. If QuickBooks can get their act together and resolve these constant problems, they may regain my confidence for reliability -- particularly when it comes to handling the money of our business. For example, I often get a the login page and message when opening the program from the app on my computer which tells me it's twice as fast to login if I download the app. Uh, what? I AM opening the program FROM the downloaded app... very frustrating. Often the software will not respond to clicking on items... while in the downloaded app -- creating estimates or invoices. This delay and glitchiness can cost a small owner like me business because I can't respond quickly enough... booting and rebooting QuickBooks is not a solution. All that to say, their competition is worse. So regardless, I have to say I feel like we have no choice but to tolerate the poor programming and pray that one day they'll get it together... just be ready to be frustrated.
Needs some improvements. Great app only thing that would make it better is an offline version for the iPad
Great - when it works.. App crashes often and has trouble down loading data
Very easy to use, and company responds to queries and requests. I have used this app for 4 months now and find it is constantly improving and great to use
Needs improvement. I love the desktop version but my app version and even the online version never works right! There is always something that doesn't work. I always go through the whole estimate or invoice and then it won't save it for me! Very frustrating and I wish they could work out all of the kinks.
"Great app unless you have employees you want to use it. (Even after the recent update that seemed to target the below issues, non of them were resolved). 

The app works great if you're an administrator but if you have employees you've set up as users who you want to empower to add expenses directly into Quickbooks (for example), which is a super basic feature that is 100% described as possible by Intuit, you're out of luck. They are unable to see accounts when they go to attribute an expense to a particular account (or a Class for the matter) and the app doesn't let them add an expense without attributing it to an account. And then, even though you wouldn't want employees to do this,  if the employee tries to add a new account in the app in order to add the expense, Whyte told they don't have permissions to do so. 

It's a bug for sure but a very big one that 100% cripples the app for those users. I can't believe this hasn't been addressed yet by a company and an app as big and established as Quickbooks. 

Please fix this asap!!!!"
Bugs galore. I hvae been using this app now for 4 years and it is the buggiest app I have ever used.  There are times where the app works flawlessly, and when it does it is a great tool, however this is a small percentage of the time.  I would not recommend using the online version to anyone using the desktop version.  The worst thing about the app is that you cannot transfer the content to the desktop version for Mac.
Super unintuitive and cumbersome. Wow you would have thought this SAAS company would have it together. Does anyone in your company actually run a business and use quickbooks? Probably not considering how poorly designed this app is. Why can you only add an receipt to a transaction after it has been categorised as an expense or income? Does it make sense to add the receipt when the transaction is being defined so you can look at what type of expense it is on the receipt? The desktop version has this feature but you have to first upload all your receipts to your computer. I'm LOLLING all the way to Xero. Good riddance after 2 years this is the nail in the coffin.
Logs me off all the time. App is constantly requires entering password even with touchID enabled. Not sure what the point of touchID is if a password is required
Best Mobile Accounting App. Great improvements in the latest version. Easily the best iPad/iPhone app for accounting, that sits well alongside the full featured QBO software.
Good app. It works really well to manage a business. A few things could be easier/more intuitive to do, but otherwise a solid app that gets the job done.
Great app. Great on the go accounting application
Starting to like it. The desktop version I bought said good for three years but payroll was only included for the first year. So when it expired, I phoned to pay to renew payroll and support told me I couldn't. Said I had to buy new desktop version or use QuickBooks online.  As a small business, this wasn't cost effective. Still not happy but I signed up for online anyway. There are a lot of things that could be improved with the online versions, but it's great that I can do some accounting no matter where I am. App has no payroll info, which is good for security I guess. Overall I'm starting to like the online for on the go.
"Best idea yet!. Run a one-man business on this app, it's the best idea. Once in a while, life has its financial surprises, and would be nice If there's an option that you could pay your dues without having to call, especially on weekends when no ones there to answer so the business doesn't stop or on a stand still.
And would also be great if intuit would allow an online payment for our customers that can be tag onto our own websites...that would be a nice touch, one option monthly billing!
Another thing, it would be nice if Intuit/QB would integrate the ""sales-forms"" invoice payment and receipt sales as one to show customers that they did paid up!
Hey, do it QB, it's for the best!
Still, awesome job! Love the app so far!"
Intuitive. Great app! Love it!
SEABREEZE SEALANTS. Awesome app, makes running our business quick & easy in all aspects, we are able to stay in control of cash flow and invoices. Highly recommend 👌🤙
Latest Update crashing on iPhone 7. Great improvements in the app. Extra features are a great bonus. Well done. On iPhone 7 the app crashes when upon opening banking is selected. I've reproduced 5 times.
Getting Better. You can keep doing more and more on phone.  Great for us small business owners. It would be 5 but when I first downloaded there was not a lot to transactions you could complete on app.
Brilliant. Brilliant app. So happy that I've migrated over to Quick Books.
Quickbooks app. Does not work well. Needs a lot of improvements. Each time I back up my files I end of with multiple copies on my iPad. Have called several times and each time they blame the app developer which I have contacted but never heard back from them. Poor program that needs fixing to get it up to good standards. Do not recommend until they fix problems.
Good app. This app and software can help you track y control all your business data, in one and easy way!
Great app. The App takes a bit to get used to but once you've played with it a bit it's very simple to navigate, update bank transactions and so on
Love it. This app works great for me.. .
Wish we could drill down on reports. I like this app but wish that I could drill down to details on the reports.  Thank you for your work on this.
Simplifies. This app makes it really easy and fast to manage receipts and expenses.
Very convenient and usable. Great app that connects me too my work platform everywhere I go!!
"Easy enough to use, works best with the online version. I'm only using this for the basics of bookkeeping, so it's enough for me.

The functions in the app is different than the online version, so I mainly use it to take pictures of invoices. I enter an invoice online, then snap a picture of the invoice using the app. I also use the app to quickly get a monthly total per supplier, which the online version doesn't have.

April 2017: Loving the new update, now there's a way to attach multiple notes/pictures to an expense, so I don't have to go back to the Desktop App for that to work, thx!!"
Business. I'm very happy with this app help me a lot
Functional with problems. The latest update took away the ability to choose territory in the app even though using a web browser does. I contacted Intuit to report the problem. Very nice but nothing has been done to fix it. Also, common reports aren't available in the app.
Down graded. From April this app is unusable. I down graded to QB ONLINE.  It appears it was released about a year too soon. Nothing but frustration from day one. The phone app is all but useless.
Best small business app!. Awesome app! Very helpful
Works well but sometime updates break it so update with caution.. About every 6th update seems to have an error. Overall its great.
Slow to respond from time to time .. The app is sometimes slow to respond.
"Hardly ever ""quick"". I use this app weekly for a window washing business and my entire team suffers from the biweekly QuickBooks bug! This would be a great app if they ever figured out how to keep it from having so many issues! I regularly can't send invoices to customers or it will shut down unexpectedly while trying to create one. It has it's stents of usefulness, and that's the only reason we keep using it. Just know... if it's working well for you, count your blessings. It may not be long till they change something and the app gremlins come out."
Good app. This is excellent for small businesses the only thing I think they should add is a quick way of entering vat on mileage money.
Not accurate, crashes often. This app goes from being usable to worthless on a whim.  It also does not show simple things like how many $ in open invoices, (right now it says we have $488 in total receivables, when we have WAY more). The desktop app is fine, the iOS app needs a ton of work.
Not happy with this. I've used Quickbooks for years and have several corporations that I handle on the program.  I'm also computer literate and have been a Quickbooks tester in the past  I'm not happy that it took me a whole day to download and set up payroll and still haven't figured out how to print reports for my customers or check for that matter
Statement from app ?. Works great for me but I wish you were able to print off a statement from the app. With all the updates lately. Why is it so hard to be able to create a statement from the app? Not the biggest deal in the world but very inconvenient.
Business at a Glance. For the detailed stuff, I like to stick to the desktop version, but for quickly seeing the status of invoices / profit and loss, the mobile app is great.
"Cheap. It's one of those slickly apps that pops up in your search result which is filtered to show only Free apps.

After you waste your time downloading and signing up, it tells you to start your Free ""trial""."
"Fantastic. Fantastic.
I'm am obsessed with this app.
A MUST for everyone!"
Before update great after horrible. I have been using Quickbooks for over 15 years. There always coming out with something new and most the time it works very well. This particular update makes it so I cannot except credit card payments via the app anymore. Trying to get in touch with customer support or get any help on this issue has been a few hours of wasted time. Still don't know what's going on I'm assuming this is their a way to force go payment users to buy the new chip reader so they can continue to except credit cards in day-to-day business. If you're reading this trying to decide to update and you use the standard headphone jack card reader and want to still receive payments via the app do not download this update.
Satisfied Customer. I'm a new user of QB app, and like what I see so far. It's easy to use and is a great asset to help keep my finances straight. It's worth the $10 per month.
Great tool for repetitive stuff. The app version is great for day to day functions.
Brilliant mobile app. It has changed my life . I am able to do quotes in the run and save so much valuable time .
Makes life easy. Great app that makes accounting on the fly so simple.
Awesome app!!. Seamless and intuitive.  Can accomplish so much with this app.  Thank you!!
A good assistant on the go. The phone app doesn't do as much as I'd like but I couldn't run my business without the software!
"Great app! Great company!. In a sea of many companies like Intuit, I am honored to work with them. 

The ease of use and professionalism are a great plus. 

All the stars fully deserved!"
Great app. Let's me keep up with things while I am on the go.
Perfect App for consulting. Fantastic app! Highly recommended. Very easy to use with ability to track invoices - it's perfect for my consulting business.
"Amazing App to accompany an amazing program. I've been using quickbooks online along with the app for over a year.  My business has never been more organized in regards to accounting.  Being able to access all of my information from my phone is a game changer. 
Will give the app 5 stars when they implement a way to move items once added to an estimate/invoice."
Best app. This made my life simpler!!!
Fantastic App. The best bookkeeping app available. LOVE this app. My bookkeeping has never been so up to date.
MGRM. Great app. Useful and easy to use.
What, no zero star option?. Great job with Touch ID and your lousy payroll app. Everything this company does is garbage. Tells you about the sad state of affairs in financial software if QuickBooks is even an option to have to use.
It's great. Enjoy this app
Intuit Keeps Working it But Stumbles on Occasion. I've been a QBO user for over 4 years now and run my whole one-man business on it. Each app version is a bit better than the last and they do fix bugs when notified. I continue to be happy to see Intuit continue to improve the app and the web interface. The blanking of bank account data in the dashboard appears to be fixed in v5.3.
Great ap. Great easy to use app really close to getting rid of my laptop entirely
"Need it but disappointed. I need this app and use it almost daily for our small business but I've been very disappointed every time you do an update. So many glitches every time making it hard to trust that new invoices were created, payments actually were taken, or emails sent. 
The last 2 updates were especially frustrating. Smaller font on invoice numbers and buttons for taking action (such as taking payment, sending emails, print options) are a real annoyance. If these kinds of things could be fixed I would change my review to 5 stars."
QB Intuit online app. Fantastic program highly recommend 👍😀
A great app. This has revolutionised my business. Saving me hours of admin every week.
Great app for my small business. Went from Excel and PDFs to QB..great decision! I'm very happy with it. One function I'd like to see added is integration with iPhone/iPad/outlook calendar.
"Great for Small Business...With Some Accounting Background. Have been using this for a few months now for my small business.  It seems to have most of my needs met very capably, and it definitely has the capacity to grow beyond what I will need in the near future.  I am happy with my purchase and choice of accounting software.

There are a few opportunities for improvement.  While Intuit markets this with a ""No Accounting Background Needed"" type of campaign, I wouldn't quite go there.  If you have some time to spend educating yourself on some of the accounting basics, it will definitely make your life much happier.  They have some very helpful training videos to help but some research on your own (if you have no accounting background) would be highly recommended.  Without it, you may end up with some bald spots.  Just sayin!  ;-)

Also, one cannot use the mobile apps (including this iPad app) to do the bookkeeping entries for a credit card like it will for a bank account.  Even with this application and the online subscription you will be paying for, you will still be stuck having to routinely go to a computer in order to process credit card transactions into your bookkeeping records here.  This is a the single largest annoyance for me so far, and really defeats part of the whole point if you are buying this in order to use the app.  While it works for a lot of things (and does so very well), you're not going to be able to get very far from your computer for your expenses if you are using a credit card.

In the end, it shows a lot of promise.  They update it regularly, bringing new features and functionality pretty frequently.  Fix that credit card functionality and I MIGHT even give it five stars."
Very good. Very good and easy app.
Simply functional. App makes invoicing easy, and allows you to track any outstanding receivables. Should make tax time much easier.
Avoid like the plague!. App doesn't work, says trial expired. Customer support are unhelpful and have no idea when it will be fixed. We have a years worth of books on this and now we need to find new software - we've been in business for more than 26 years and have never known service like this. Seriously, find another solution. This is not the software you are looking for.
Defects still in App. App was brilliant until it started alerting that my trial expires so need to upgrade when I'm on a full package and not trial version? Fix needed Intiut.
"Major step in the wrong direction. After a hard drive crash made me paranoid about losing my quickbooks desktop data, I decided to ""upgrade"" to quickbooks online. For a company called Intuit, you'd expect their products to be, well, intuitive! This is the most difficult, buggy software or app I've ever dealt with. Error messages constantly pop up warning that the work just done wasn't saved. When I check, it was saved. I've had to delete many duplicate entries from this. Data entry that would've taken me an hour or so on my desktop version now takes several hours a night, several nights a week. I'm going to have to downgrade to a desktop version again, and will just pay monthly fees for cloud backups instead."
Not helpful. This app doesn't help me. I get errors every time I try to match or categorize a transaction from my bank. It's useless for me.
Slow and buggy. Disappointed in app. Doesn't correlate well with desktop version. Slow to load information and sometimes won't update accounts.
Disappointing and expensive. Having used a trusty excel for many years to do my accounts, I decided to upgrade to QB specifically for the functionality to be able to automatically reconcile against my bank account. This has ended up being a complete waste of time and money.... it took several days to get it to connect to the bank account in the first place and I had to get support involved from both QB and my bank. This lasted about a week, before it stopped working....and I have never been able to get it to work since! I actually don't know if it is the protocols of the bank or QB which has caused this....the error messaging from QB is so utterly unintelligible and meaningless, that I doubt I will ever know.  Also worth mentioning, the app seems to have significantly less functionality in it than the web version of QB (when you manage to find it - that's not obvious either!!). Really surprising and disappointing how little you can actually do in the app, particularly when the bank rec doesn't work. Overall, this app is absolute rubbish, very expensive, and I would not recommend under any circumstances.  Quick books???? You gotta be kidding me!!!
"Excellent accounting software. Subscribed to Plus version. Good value compared to others with same or less functionality. 
Love how it is always updating adding new features. If you like this app keep posting your suggestion and eventually the Tech people will make it happen. 
What could be better? Be able to send Purchase order to supplier via the app and able to customise the PO form both online and on App. I have been saying this all the time. When is it going to happen guys!! 😊"
"Okay...When it works. I would really love to be able to use QuickBooks, but instead I have to waste my time on the ""free trial"" (that tries to convince you to buy it immediately with sale pricing), by constantly locking myself out of my bank account. I can't even log into my bank via the QuickBooks iPad app now, because it just keeps getting my account suspended. Verifying the login information does nothing. The app keeps glitching, and it's definitely frustrating.

While only a trivial thing, they want you to buy into the app, so it is constantly trying to sell you. That's fine, I understand how sales work. What gets me is they offer a 30-day free trial, but the moment you create an account they offer you that sale pricing I mentioned. However, if you buy into the ""act fast pricing,"" you don't get a free trial at all. Nothing mentions that. It isn't a ""pay now and you get this pricing after your free trial."" Is Intuit that desperate for money?

They also emailed me an offer for a free card reader for mobile. Another one of those things that no matter how many times I pressed process, filled out my information, and checked out, the website kept telling me it can't process for whatever reason. First my address was wrong. Then my payment information was wrong (I never got prompted for payment info until after that error). Then I just gave up. So many hassles and they don't seem to be worth the effort. I'll continue the trial, then probably move on."
"Access. This app is great. It is so nice to be out in the field looking at a project and make an estimate right then and there while things are fresh in your mind. Not to mention for the quick service call we are able to make our  invoice right there and present it when we are complete with the work.

Business owner. Used desktop for years and now after switching to iMac and iPhones this app is perfect and couldn't be easier.  Recommend this to anyone looking for an accounting app.
Might be better. Purchases within the app are very expensive! And, by the way, the app cannot be considered as stable
Great app!!. No issues so far. Simple to use.
Slow to respond from time to time .. The app is sometimes slow to respond.
Good app. Great app easy to use
"Online version---NOT user friendly. I got this app under the advice of my Cpa but I have been pulling my hair out making entries and editing categories.  If you are not an a person well versed on all the ""ins and outs"" of this software good luck!  Quicken has its idiosyncrasies but I will take it any day over Quick Books!  

The staff at Quickbooks is super patient and if you need help but I have had to call them several times to  for simple entries!

Very frustrated from Austin, Texas"
QuickBooks on the Go. I'm rating this so it will stop asking me in the app every time I open it.
"Good but frustrating.. No access to Vendor information or Purchase Orders on an iPhone or iPad. Have complained about this for nearly 2 years. Falling on deaf ears. They agree that it would make sense but there is no one that gives a *%!£ to do anything.
3/13/2017 Have now a problem accessing QB Online since yesterday. Download company on either the iPhone or iPad takes an hour or more and on certain devices never will. Customer service doesn't have a clue what is happening. We have all gone multiple resets and all other aspects of the devices operate correctly. 
Extremely upsetting on an extremely busy Monday.
4/4/2017 We are still stuck with no access to our invoicing. We were told that a review was coming out today. CUSTOMER SERVICE IS USLESS!!! We are looking for an option to change to at this point."
Convenient accounting app. Super usefull app, get you at the top of your finances, recommended!!!
AKA LABELS. Great App. Highly recommended
Not suitable. Not happy with this app and it won't let me cancel it! Help!
Sold Bookkeeping App. This app is solid, as Intuit is, with most all of thier financial products. The mobile app has great functionality for data collection, basic financial reporting (P&L, Bal., aging A/R), an all around great way to get real time info from staff in the field if your a service based biz on the GO. If you need better aggregation of data on your organization you will have to look to custom reports. Web portal features need to be made more accessible to mobil users. Hoping to see more job costing/class fields, and reporting abilities in future updates to QB Online mobile app on Apple's App Store.
"Not useable in multi-user environment. Still a 1 star.  What is wrong with Intuit programmers?

Yup, yet again another update, and still not useable in multi-user.  My business has more than 1 user account.  Locations and Classes do not work in their accounts.  How many years will this take to fix a bug that has been present since day 1?

Another update and I stand behind my previous review(s).

Seriously? Another update, and still not multi-user friendly.  But, oh boy, something works with Apple Watch.  When will Intuit fix the multi-user issues?  Someone else mentions they fix bugs.  I can say the exact opposite - they leave bugs for years!

I want to use and like this app. I've looked at every update since the very 1st version.  It does seem to be slowly improving, but is still not useable for my company."
"Good Ap Sketchy Company. The App is probably good if you've already paid it's a great feature Ill admit.

But the company makes it hard to switch to desktop which is unfair. In 2017 their gonna make me a Mac user use internet explorer?? Huh?? Everyone knows they don't make That for Mac. 

I was forced to leave the desktop for Mac version which was serving great.

They no longer offered a version I could use to pay my independent contractors.

I went to online. Without a choice.
I have since been forced to buy the most expensive plan to do what I used to do on the desktop for free. 

A company like this would gain more to be great to its long time paying customers. 

But hey, we live in these times it is how it is.

Dear Quickbooks. Show us Mac users some love!"
Needs more functionality. Time tracking capabilities are missing which make this unusable for me, forcing me to use the online version which defeats the purpose of this app. It doesn't really make sense to release an iOS version that can only do a portion of the tasks.
"iOS app > than the Web version. It is pleasantly surprising to see that the app is faster on the phone in comparison to the website!

Keep up the good work 👍🏼"
Mrs. Love QuickBooks and this app is sooo easy to use and Love it!
Great app, easy to use!. This is a great financial management app. I'm far from an accountant but once you have your chart of accounts set up, keeping track of expenses and income is a breeze! A few swipes of your finger and you can reconcile your bank accounts. If only more things were this easy!
Great app.. Great app
QuickBooks. Very good app I will purchase after my trial thanks
"Great for small business. It's a great app for small business. Since it's a cloud solution, cheap and easy to access your finances from any where.  
Need improvement to have detailed views and reporting for the management."
Great app. I am enjoying staying on top of things while on the go.
"Instant customer service 👌. Great app for small to mid size business.  Phenomenal integration from windows 10. So far so good.  

Thanks."
A real time saver. As a busy professional, this app helps keep my accounting up to date on the fly. The app is extremely easy to use and updates instantly to my online version of QuickBooks.  Well worth it!
Great tool. Awesome app, so far so good
Clunky and Incomplete. The app is nice for taking a quick look at your books, but by no means is it a replacement for the full program. When you try to add supporting documents to an invoice, there's no real options for actually attaching. If you actually try to run Quickbooks from an iPad, good luck. The app is stripped of features, and the browser version is slow, clunky, and unsupported. Quickbooks online has many conveniences, but running it from anything other than a traditional computer is frustrating. Hopefully they catch up with our mobile on-the-go world.
does not refresh. My primary complaint about this app is that it takes forever to refresh, or does not refresh certain things at all. This one issue is a huge annoyance.  Despite how many times I have opened and used the app, it still shows me my profit/loss for February (tomorrow is April). It also continues to display an invoice I deleted months ago, and when I try to delete it again it tells me it's been deleted already. So frustrating, especially because I am paying for the QB service.
Mr. Doesn't work on iPad Pro or iPhone. It says my subscription has expired. I have had it for several years and it still works on MacBook but on iOS it thinks I am on a free trial until 13th April but still locks me out saying I need to update my subscription. It is useless to me if it won,t work on iPad because I photograph all my receipts into the app. Will cancel subscription if it doesn't work soon.
Great app. It works great
Don't bother. Been using QB desktop for years. Disapointed in the sas/mobile version.  Mobile app is slow and frequently fails to load at all.  Not much functionality at all besides creating invoices.  Checking account balances or customer A/R is not worth the bother on mobile app. This is an ok solution. I bet there are better options available than QB mobile app.
"Crash books. This app constantly gives me error pop ups! It does not work as described and has a difficult time doing anything that the desktop version does. 

I have two different companies listed on my account, and the app never will let me switch between the two.  It always load the same one no matter which one I click on.

If you use a lot of features and have multiple employees this app seems to have problems. 

Needs a good bit of work to fix the bugs."
"President. Quickbooks is a fantastic app, it is easy to use and tracks everything I need and keeps all the information organized.
Would recommend to everyone"
"Mohammed salman 6s. Superb app all ledger's are in just my pocket 
My request is to app developer 
Suppliers options suppliers balance"
Great apps. Good performance
A great improvement over the Mac desktop version. It saves me tons of time that I used to spend recording payments, expenses and running reports. Client payments are easily paid via credit card by the client and automatically applied to the invoice. It has simplified my accounting.
Convenient access to financial information. We recently switched over from the desktop version of QB and have found the app to be a convenient way to view financial statements. I also really like the ability to take pictures of receipts and attach them to expenses from my mobile phone.
"App doesn't work. After speaking with the help desk the advise I got was ""the app must not compatible with your phone (iPhone 6 plus)"". I leave this review as I only signed up with QuickBooks to manage my businesses accounts ""on the go"" and it's been a waste of money for this purpose"
Love!!. The QuickBooks app is absolutely perfect! When handling business on the go and clients are making payments, I can easily create an invoice and/or sales receipt. Makes my job easier. It tracks all of our business expenses, profits and losses. This is great!
Love this app!. I absolutely love this app. It allows me to run my business efficiently and effectively!
QuickBooks. Great app!!
Great app. Very easy to use. Reliable. Every once in a while it has loading issues but it's rare.
"PLEASE UPDATE. Please update app or bring previous version 
Constantly downloading customer data that takes forever and then get errors
Please fix quick"
God send!!!!. 24\7 mobile locksmith. My customers now get their invoices 10 seconds after I do the job instead of 7 to 10 days later. Expenses are no problem. I connect my banking account and swipe right to add an expense. The best app for a small business owner bar none. Also, not knowing how to use the app I have had to call customer service twice. I don't know why these people say that they are waiting for an hour, I've never waited more than 2 minutes for a representative to pick up. Both times they solved my problem within a matter of 2 to 3 minutes.
Excellent tool for my biz. Since I got this app on my phone I hardly need to go to the office, or open my laptop. Love it!
Convenience. I really love the convenience and accessibility of this app and QuickBooks online. Since switching from desktop pro to this I've been able to keep up with paperwork in the field. I think it's great. I just wish they made an upgrade so I could automatically subtract expenses from specific jobs. Having everything separate is a real hassle.
Great app!. I love the flexibility of having my company info at all times.
GARY STANTON. This app means I can seem to know what I am doing, it actually works for me.
"Great app unless you have employees you want to use it. The app works great if you're an administrator but if you have employees you've set up as users who you want to empower to add expenses directly into Quickbooks (for example), which is a super basic feature that is 100% described as possible by Intuit, you're out of luck. They are unable to see accounts when they go to attribute an expense to a particular account (or a Class for the matter) and the app doesn't let them add an expense without attributing it to an account. And then, even though you wouldn't want employees to do this,  if the employee tries to add a new account in the app in order to add the expense, Whyte told they don't have permissions to do so. 

It's a bug for sure but a very big one that 100% cripples the app for those users. I can't believe this hasn't been addressed yet by a company and an app as big and established as Quickbooks. 

Please fix this asap!!!!"
Can't Live Without It. I don't know how I did business before this app. I love that I can access my company books anywhere. I love the way I can take a photo of the receipts for my expenses. Thank you QB!
1 Step Forward - 2 Steps Back. For the most part, the app functions correctly after finally resolving the issues with accepting credit cards. Now, it wants to download the company information each morning. It is doing it on all the devices and accounts that our company uses. It's very frustrating when we need to quickly pull up a customers information only to be forced to wait for it to re-download all the info. Hurry up and wait
Business. Great app
Crashing in on the reliable. Overall not a great product - I actually do enjoy quickBooks online. But this app is just atrocious. History improve in so many ways just to get one more star out of me
Love QuickBooks. Love being able to check things quick on the app and I love how you keep the software up to date with changes!
Mr. Great app!
Great App... Works amazingly well.
"Dissapointed. I was hoping for more. If the app has issues logging into a bank account, ect. it gives you an error code that you have to log onto there website to walk you through what it ""might"" be, then you have to go back and forth, try different things to fix it....ahhhh. You get my point😒"
Owner. Great mobile app, keeps my company on the move!
"Great App. Been with Quickbooks for two years now and still really impressed 
Very easy to use and works across all platforms
Would strongly recommend"
So much better. Intuit have certainly listened to there customers and have massively improved the app with some recent updates. So much better and easier to use than before. Well done intuit finally glad a huge company has finally listened to its customers
Amazing App. Amazing app that functions well enough to keep track of and coordinate your business.
Excellent app. Superb app living my life by it now couldn't recommend enough
"Worthy app, very user friendly !!. Personally this app is unbelievable.
It dose pretty much everything.

However, it would be even better if you could set up folders in a name customer by you.
Second, it would be even better if you could access certain command requests without it bugging-out. So far that has only happened once.

Otherwise it would have got five star."
Great app, easy to use. Love being able to manage my business on the go. Could use more features, but it's still a great app and QuickBooks is always updating it. :)
"Fix finally now I can get back to work.. This Version fixed the errors from the last update.   Glad it working again.    Quickbooks has been good except the last update.  This one fixed the issue.   

We us this app for our onsite Business and it's great. Several times I would send an invoice to the customer when I'm leaving their home and before I get to the next job it's already paid."
Broken app. Unusable. App fails to load company data. Waited an hour on the phone and never got help. Killing my ability to invoice customers while mobile, which is the only reason I chose the online version that I pay for every month! Intuit is not intuitive, they're only into your money. Zero support. Zero answers. Zero. The worst.
awesome app. Awesome app and online as well. Runs rings around Xero. App is 100x better
User friendly - no need for anything else. This is an amazing app to use on all devices with my QuickBooks online package. Managing all aspects of my business from wherever I need it. Highly recommended.
PDF NOTE ON IPAD. Why can't we add a PDF note on iPad app. I can do it by accessing desktop version on ipad. But it's a pain doing it that way. It would be simpler to add that option to the app. Come on guys keep up with the technology. Quit lagging behind.
"Issues. It was working fine on my iPad up until last week. Then starting bugging. Not all customer transaction appear on the mobile app.
Called customer service about it. They told me that they were ""working on it"".
We shall see.
I pay for it monthly...I asked if I still had to pay this month even though it's not working as advertised...answer was yes. Not happy with that answer. I will keep you posted.
Bob"
Broken app. Unusable. Going on over a week like this. Killing my ability to invoice customers while mobile, which is the only reason I chose the online version that I pay for every month! Intuit is not intuitive, they're only into your money.
App Issue. I've been using the QuickBooks app for over 6 months and it worked fine. Now, for the past week the app will not let me access my company data or the data is incorrect after multiple reinstalls. This is very aggravating and QB's customer support stated it's an IOS issue. Please correct this issue asap. Thank you
Horrible MOBILE Support!. This app has a ton of problems and nobody at Intuit cares to fix it. App won't load half the time, invoices do not show up, errors all the time, signature capture doesn't work, and no support available for the mobile app. The only thing they know is to tell you to uninstall and reinstall it which fixes nothing! If they don't get their issues fixed, I am switching!
"Knight in shining armour. I've been in business for quite literally decades now. During this time I have used accountants, advisors, both financial and investment sectors. Some of these were the most amazing money saving specialists I've ever met, and some were down right ridiculous. I've seen software not fit for purpose, over complicated and I hope you see where I'm going with this.
I was low and business was slow, my profit was non existent! The seeds of desperation were growing in my head and I couldn't sleep a wink!
And then by lucky chance one day, I saw an ad on a TV show, an Ad the like I've never seen
' Experience something different' it said, 'with our new quick book software, it's quick, it's simple and confidential, and amazingly good value' and so I bought a subscription, then within the hour I was up and running and haven't looked back. It's so good that my hair is starting to grow back.
This has to be the best yet, and a genuine essential App for any business large or small Yet don't just take my word for it! Don't delay, download the app today"
Owner. Don't Do it!  The customer service is horrendous. I have spent hours and hours on the phone with their people. They canceled my subscription when I went to fix something I can head no customer service. When I got the subscription issue corrected and then renewed my subscription they charged me twice for it, after that was corrected they canceled my subscription again. So when I needed customer service after that I could not get any customer service. Both of those times good cook it shut me down for a day each. A little while ago I got there update for their online version. Tonight I printed 50 invoices fold them and they do not lineup with my windowed envelopes. So I called customer service to get that taken care of. Their suggestion was go by different envelopes. Maybe I should buy a different software. I'm still having problems they said they will submit my problem to the engineers.
Not working. I've been a customer of QuickBooks online pretty much since it came out. The opportunity to use my mobile phone to access QuickBooks while I was out and about seemed fantastic. When it's working it's fab. But recently ( the last 4 weeks at least) the app has failed to download my data and won't refresh. Saying unexpected error. So I am unable yet again (this has happened before) to access my data. The last time it happened it lasted a few months then suddenly it started working again. I had contacted intuit regarding this and actually the techie from QuickBooks online that I spoke to gave up and suggested I contact intuit direct. This is very disappointing as I spend £30 / month to enable me to access my data where ever I am. And it's not letting me do that.
Disappointed. Do not download this app.   I'm sorry I did.  Extremely flawed.
Great app. Far easier to use than desktop QuickBooks. Great software
Awesome App. This app really helps me keep track of all my transactions for my pool business. Easy to use and has everything I need.
Owner. Don't Do it!  The customer service is horrendous. I have spent hours and hours on the phone with their people. They canceled my subscription when I went to fix something I can head no customer service. When I got the subscription issue corrected and then renewed my subscription they charged me twice for it, after that was corrected they canceled my subscription again.

Time saver. Saves time to be able to categorize expenses from my phone.
Please repair!. Its a excelent, but in 1 mounth are problem to connect in sometimes!!  I have problem to connect to app in my iPhone and a need for my business, that is terrible problem.
Getting better with every upgrade.. Great app. They do lure you with the free use then hit ya with the charges later. I think it's a useful tool in the toolbox.
Utter crap. If I could give no stars I would app crashes all the time won't send invoices to customers I have had for years have been struggling on with QuickBooks for several years but now can't take the frustration anymore caused by this utter waste of money.
What a life saver. I needed something to simplify the data input that comes with invoicing and dealing with the piles of receipts with the flexibility of not having to open up my laptop to do so every time.  When I saw a promotion to try out QuickBooks online with ability to have access on mobile devices I figured I'd give it a try.  It's been a life saver.  My account transferred seamlessly and quickly.  It eliminated having to manually enter my credit card purchases and bank account transactions because you can link those accounts right to QuickBooks and they update automatically.  I can take pictures of receipts right from my phone or iPad and take care of them immediately as well as emailing invoices or recording payments received right from my phone or iPad.  It's great having this ability on the go.  So far I've discovered that I do have to log onto the website directly to get more detailed/specific reports, but it's possible I just haven't learned how to do it yet via the app. Thanks for simplifying my life in this aspect anyway.  Hoping it makes tax season a little easier.
Great for mobile small business !. We couldn't live without our Quickbooks online mobile app!  Look up information and match bank transactions right away.  Would like to see more functionality for customer and vendor invoicing and billing options as well as filtering but overall a great, easy to use tool.
Bad update. Used to work good until last update now when I open the app is says downloading company data, gets stuck there for ages. If it finally loads, there are no customer invoices, just payments. Tried deleting the app and reinstalling but does the same thing. The PC app works fine and my employees have Samsung phones and they haven't complained of any issues may just be an iPhone app problem.
Not Reliable. Is not reliable. Not a replacement for desktop app or web based QB online. Different icons, different navigation, missing tools reports and features. Data does not reliably import into app from accounts.
"Not worth money and it's free!. When it works it's ok at best but it's too flawed to take seriously. 
Among its faults:
Failing to find entries on search even when the search term is correct. 

Doing things like stating the ""delivery server is down"" when trying to email an invoice. The ""delivery server"" is not down as the user finds out when they continue to send other invoices. 

Upon investigation of the fault it issues brainless messages such as ""You (name) and You (same name) we're working on the document at the same time and you (name) finished before you (same name) did. 

You get the point!

App search not formatted with an iPad so the iPad user cannot see all of the information being searched for (when search works at all)

Seems to randomly wish to send verification text codes even though it claims that it should only happen once.

Updates do not address the faults just add a fluffy new feature. 

Seems the app was slung together and no one researches how it might be used.

In use there are constant error messages (like for every step) saying you don't have permission to add s part and then it lets you do it. Imagine going to your customer for a signature and they see these messages. 

App is constantly updated giving the user features they don't need but they never update to fix the bugs!"
Powerful Bookkeeping in your hand.. Fantastic program to track costs, expenses, create invoices and it's all done to generally accepted accounting principles.
App. Grate app worth purchasing I'd recommend this to anyone
QB makes me look good. QB app is fantastic. I can write and present an estimate right at the job site or give my customer an invoice, or accept payment. In brief....it makes me look good!
"Soooo slow. I have been using this app for about three years , and it was very functional and useful, but now, almost every time I open it, it says ""downloading data,"" and stays there... for 3-5 minutes- doesnt matter whether my phone is on WiFi or cell coverage. I hope they fix this bug."
"Not bad, very useful. I hated using the full desktop version, so the online version was a pleasant surprise to me. 

I don't think the mobile app alone will be very useful to many people, but, unused in conjunction with the desktop app (still an online, light version of the full desktop version with payroll, but enough for most businesses that don't need that.)

The mobile app allows you to create customers, invoice them and receive a payment (and post it) all quite quickly. I figured it out while at a customer's place, only took a couple of minutes. You can then email it right to them, and print, all from your mobile device, providing you have an AirPrint printer (not sure if it queues it ready for when you get back to base or not, but it would be great if it did.

One of the more powerful features, if you're brave enough, is the ability to link it to your bank accounts. That allows you to go through your transactions, receive payments, post expenditures to relevant accounts. One really neat aspect is that it will remember the vendor and account, and, by default, post the expense to the same account.

If you've run a purchase order, or invoice, and it's a unique amount in the bank account, it will highlight it as a match, so you don't have to go looking for the transaction. ""Accept,"" and you're done.

Also supports Square, as in, reconciles transactions (haven't used that yet.)

A big con is having to login fairly frequently, and without rhyme or reason. Using an iPhone generated password allows you to add it to your keychain, but it does not always automatically log you in, or use fingerprint, which is a bit of a bummer. You can, at least, paste the password from its place in the keychain/passwords file in settings.

Overall, great for productivity, once it's set up. I would like to see the ability to use the camera to scan barcodes, which can be married up to sku items - e.g., as you are billing a customer onsite, scan the sku of the items you are selling them."
"Not good enough to run your business. This is a great app when it works, but when something goes south intuit doesn't have good IT guys to figure out problems. 
I've been using this app for about two years with minor issues. Now I'm not able to login and when I do not all my data is available. 
I tried calling tech support but it seems they need more help than I do, makes me sad. 
App keeps on loading my data almost ever-time I open it now. 
At this point it is useless as it takes more than an hour to load and at the end not all the data is there."
Stuck in Data Download. Can't open app on iPad or iPhone. Stuck in a Data Download loop. Support says there are no known issues, what a joke.
BUYER BEWARE Crash instantly on iPhone 6. This app works sometimes but it will instantly crash and doesn't operate properly on my iPhone 6 running the latest iPhone software. I tried removing and reinstalling but it still doesn't work properly. Why don't you guys fix this? Also, it annoyingly downloads company info every time you open it which takes what seems like hours. I have a very small landscape business. Should this be the case? Come on intuit! Get your act together
"Was Great Until Recently. This used to be a great app until a few weeks ago. Now, every morning when we go to open the app it states ""Downloading Company Data"" and does this for hours. We have customers needing to get estimates, pay invoices, etc., but can't because we can't use the app! This just recently started happening. QB- CAN YOU PLEASE FIX THIS ISSUE??? This type of problem shouldn't go on for this long!"
"I also should have read the reviews. I only use my QuickBooks to track expenses and deposits due to the nature of my business.  I have been trying to use the mobile version of this program now, after being on the PC version for over 10 years, and still cannot find a way to log my deposits.  

I can accept payments for invoices, which I do not use for the majority of my business but cannot enter a straight deposit."
Convenient, fast at a glance with limited functionality. This is a nice compliment to the full web app. I can get a quick on the go look at my books but would love to see more functionality for time sheets, payroll and reports.
Poor. If you write a review and the nickname is taken you have to start all over again. App is very limited and web version has problems with iPad Pro
App not working. The app won't open on my phone.... just says downoading company info.  Have already rebooted phone and re-installed
This app needs updated.  This version won't work :(. Not working reloaded app no go.    :(
Mostly Great!. At the moment QB's Mobile won't work. Some kind of trouble with company data downloading. Hopefully fixed soon.. otherwise good and handy app.
"Good but frustrating.. No access to Vendor information or Purchase Orders on an iPhone or iPad. Have complained about this for nearly 2 years. Falling on deaf ears. They agree that it would make sense but there is no one that gives a *%!£ to do anything.
3/13/2017 Have now a problem accessing QB Online since yesterday. Download company on either the iPhone or iPad takes an hour or more and on certain devices never will. Customer service doesn't have a clue what is happening. We have all gone multiple resets and all other aspects of the devices operate correctly. 
Extremely upsetting on an extremely busy Monday."
Easy to use. Great app. Very happy with it
I should have read reviews. I have used QB for over 10 yrs now and my desktop version is going to be out dated soon. I thought I would try the online system because my business is a travel service. I'm hoping this will help redirect my time (less on QB at my desk).  I signed up for the trial. Download everything I need and set my business up on my PC, then downloaded the app to my phone. Logged in on my phone and the downloaded crashed 3 times. I tried it again and went to bed to let it do it download, in the morning I checked and it still had not loaded completely. I had to turn off my wifi and use my data. Then it popped up and said there was a Error.... Not a good start for something that is supposed to make things easier for my business. Not very stable!! (Day 1 of 30 day trial).
Perfect. Changed over from using sage about 6months ago and have never looked back, excellent software, the app makes it completely agile and useable on the move.
Awesome App. It's a womderful App, so versatile and functional
Fantastic product overall. The mobile app gets about 3 stars but desktop version is 2nd to none. Overall love QuickBooks and it has helped my business. Although mobile app not as good, it's nice to have on the go when I need info on prior jobs out in the field. What I don't like about mobile app is that it won't automatically put next invoice number like the desktop version, that would be a nice fix!
"Not seamless, very frustrating. Why isn't ""Transactions"" listed as a choice in the left menu bar?! I wish the choices in that list were the same as they are on the web version of QuickBooks Online, making it a truly seamless solution. I also can't edit a transaction in the app once it's been saved, or make it a split transaction. So I have to go to web version anyway. This makes the app useless much of the time. It's incredibly frustrating, and if my accountant didn't ask that I work in QuickBooks, I would abandon it in an instant."
"Instant customer service 👌. Great app for small to mid size business.  Phenomenal integration from windows 10. So far so good.  

Thanks."
"Tops. I've never used any accounting software or accounting apps in my life & can honestly say this is the best!

If you type 55378008 into any xl column & turn your laptop upside down it spells..BOOBLESS! 😄"
Introduce me to accounting. I love the app, it's giving me a good idea on what accounting is about. I'm kinda looking forward to take this course in the fall :)
Came in clutch. Needed to organize and file taxes and P&L reports. QuickBooks self employed and main app really helped do this in record time, fast and efficiently. Glad I chose QuickBooks!
Phenomenal. QuickBooks app on my phone combined with the online system is the best thing to happen to my new small business. I no longer feel like an accountant full time & business owner part time!
Brilliant!. After years of using outdated and under performing sage software, finally I can use a truly mobile cloud based app that fulfils all the needs of a small business. Come change of tax year make the switch, it's easy and you will wish you had done it years ago.
Great App. App is never up today's with invoices. The app has become useless to me other than being able to find customers phone numbers and addresses. Please fix ASAP.
The Whites. Invoices are a major problem with this app.  Most of our clients don't use or don't have an email address to send invoices to. So I have to individually print each one. I would like to be able to batch print invoices, as this is how most clients prefer to be billed. Another major problem is the invoices won't show our address!  I've tried adding it multiple times.  Not being able to access customer info offline is some what of a hassle, as most of the time when it needs to be accessed we are on the phone with the customer.  The online version of QuickBooks seems to be quite the waste of money.  Just buy the desktop version.
Amazing app. I love this app makes everything easier for me and faster. This app is amazing I just love it!
Perfect for a small consulting firm. This app is everything I need for my consulting firm. Easy to use and easy to keep track of expenses on the road.  Invoicing is a breeze. Love the data in the cloud.  Take a pic and throw away those receipts!  Works flawlessly between my PC, Mac, iPad and iPhone.  Only gripe is the iPad & Phone versions are not as similar as one would expect.
Love the new app. 5 stars
Needs time keeping entry. QuickBooks really needs to come up with an app to do their time entry for QuickBooks online
Major issues. I'm having a lot of difficulty with QuickBooks apps across all of my devices. I started with the trial, then subscribed before my trial ended for the discount- which appeared to go through fine. However-It didn't. My trail ended 2/10 and I've been trying to subscribe ever since. I was forced to subscribe from my mobile version since that's were I started the trial (which I thought was a little crazy ) When managing my subscriptions I see if finally took yesterday ( March 5th) however it didn't translate across all devises. I'm unable to manage anything because the subscription window keeps popping up-even though I PAID. I love QuickBooks, I chose QuickBooks because they're a large company who should have the resources to fix any issues quickly! Please help!!!!
App Doesn't refresh with changes. The app doesn't refresh right away making it appear as though changes I have made aren't saved. However, when I get back to my computer all of my attempts to make changes like adding customer payments have been saved. For example, one time I had the same payment recorded 3 times.
Kinda cumbersome. This app isn't very intuitive and there are a lot of free apps that do the same thing.
"Very satisfied!. Been using the mobile app for the past 3 months now, and I can say it does everything I need. Very easy to issue invoices, receive the money, match, reconcile the bank.
The support people are very helpful and have a lot of patience!"
Very solid app.. A couple gripes, but overall great user experience.
Starting with errors. I am just starting my beekeeping business and trying to track expenses. Quick books somehow has me making a $164 sale. I can't erase it because it doesn't exist. Would love it but can't reconcile the books if random numbers are calculated out of thin air!
Quickbooks. This app is excellent and the version on my computer is even better save's me hours when quoting well worth the money and it's also good for on site reference
Excellent. Great mobile App from Intuit, QuickBooks online is great and although a bit different from the desktop version it has improved the way I work with my clients
Great app. A lot of functionality from the site packed into the app. Easy to use.
Intuitive. QB does a great job with the app. Easy to understand if you use QB online.
Great App. I personally find the app easier then the desktop version. Everything is quick and easy to do. Raise an invoice or estimate instantly and see your bank account balance. Great.
Limited compared to Quickbooks Desktop. Quickbooks online is just OK.  It has some limits that did not exist in the desktop version. A lot of them have to do with assisted payroll.  For example, the app does not tell you each pay period how much of a contribution to pay towards Simple IRA's and give you a chance to indicate whether they were paid.  It just assumes it was done without giving you any notice.  Other limitations make it just OK.
"Waste of valuable time.. All I wanted was a simple app to send 1 (one) out of state customer an invoice  at the end of the month. 
My other 2 (two) customers don't really need one. 
Took an hour to set it up and a couple more to figure out I was declined.  

Just wanted something simple."
Jason. Great app, but the online version needs progressive invoicing, fix that and its 5 star!
USELESS APP. Mileage tracking is grossly inaccurate, way too many inadequacies and limitations on the invoicing and accounting features.  This app is a joke.  I tried it for several months and have lost money as a result of it's shortcomings.  The positive reviews here must be fake.  Do your research and search the web for accurate reviews.  I recommend Everlance as a better option.
Really great :). Really great software package. Requires some dedicated learning for someone with no accounting / bookkeeping background - but functionality and power of the software are fantastic. Very happy with QuickBooks. Thanks :)
Great App. Loving it - I love keeping track of expenses on the go and how it syncs with Quickbooks Online.
Not good for my use. I would like to have a setting to hide all account information so I can have employees out with iPads giving estimates or quotes. This is for personal business. Good for that but forget trying to take pictures of receipts to write expenses.. Takes longer than scanning them on my Pc
Great App. Extremely easy to use and has made doing my accounts a much easier and enjoyable experience! Would highly recommend!
Lots of steps. I like the app but there are lots of steps and it takes me a while. Occasionally the transaction doesn't go through. It does update my QuickBooks so I like that and it saves my bookkeeper time
Great App!. Very useful and convenient app.
Best app!. Best app better then squared
Report functions. Could you please add report function into QBO mobile app?
Good app. 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Fantastic App. Works well! Fantastic App!
Managing Partner at Green Mesa Capital, LLC. A very useful app. I can do everything I want through this app. In addition, the app has features the browser does not have, like the expense receipt capture.
Excellent App. This app is amazing, makes my life so easy and customer service is very helpful.. will definitely recommend. Just one thing that needs working on, app does not sync with my Barclays Bank account so I have to export statements manually and upload to app, otherwise 5 star from me.
Great. Great app, great software all around for my small business!
"Best app for organizing your small business!!. Only had this for a couple of days now and just invoiced my first clients. It was so easy to use. 

I wish it could be personalized more but still overall a great start to my business!"
A Very Useful and User Friendly App. I started a business this year, I deal with realtors and property owners whom aren't living near me. I say this because I got on this app because i had to have a way to keep records easily and still do my work. And I have been grateful for this app since!! I have to say for me i like that I don't have to remind myself of bills not paid , and then it keeps records of materials bought and all business expenses with a few simple steps of connecting your bank and this app. They constantly update and add choices without making it ominous. So thank you QuickBooks!!!! Here's to another great year!!!
Good app, a bit expensive to upgrade. Good app, but a bit expensive to upgrade. It holds me back from doing it
Huge Asset for Small Business. Love the flexibility this app provides.  I can do everything from the app that I can do from the desktop although it takes twice as long.  However, as a small business owner being the accountant and the laborer it is great having the ability to pull up invoices with clients and email invoices on the go.
Good but needs more functionality. This app works good, but needs more features added. For example, I have to go to a browser and log in there in order to add a deposit manually. I know functionality is being added continuously. So I a hopeful that my review can be a 5 star review in the near future.
Awesome. Great app! Making bookkeeping much more enjoyable!
"Great app but. We need to have the ability to track mileage within the online version. Also need to be able to auto fill a lot of data over to turbotax and allow it to do personal property taxes. 

I think the cost of this service is high for compared to the desktop version of which you can do more with. Please work on the updates and continue to offer a great product."
I love this better than their computer program!!!!. I love this app better than my computer program they have, it's easier to use & easier to track your expenses & sales. I recommend this to all my friends that basically run their business out of a vehicle saves on extra work when you get home.
This app makes being a business owner much more enjoyable. To be able to keep track of finances, outgoing & ongoing charges made all the difference for my small business.
Amazing App, but few things need to be improved.. Very good app, but needs few things like the web version. If thats added then its the best app for start up businesses.
WoW!. Really cool app! It's linked on all my device! I can make invoices on my phone and send it to my clients directly from email! Cool stuff!
Great App. Works well for small to medium size businesses on the go!
Great app. It seems to work well!  I would suggest it, you can easily go from a laptop to iPad to iPhone...
Great for start up. The app works great! I can do nearly all of my bookkeeping from my phone. If I need more detailed I just use my laptop! The monthly subscription is nice too!
Can't Live Without It. I don't know how I did business before this app. I love that I can access my company books anywhere. I love the way I can take a photo of the receipts for my expenses. Thank you QB!
"Slowly getting better!. New app is working great - I can take payments from within the app now VS using the GoPayment app and having to import the transaction. That saves a lot of time. Touch ID works! The Home page is very convenient in seeing my activity and P&L's. One thing that needs fixed is the ""Due on Date"" for invoicing. All of my customers are COD and even though I have this option selected it still invoices out NET 30 across all platforms (Mac, iOS and windows). 

Would love to see the option of allowing customer to add a tip in the future, like in GoPayment.

 Feb 22, 2017 - open/paid/pending invoices aren't showing up under customers name.."
"Good Online Bookkeeping Application. I am an International Tax Accountant but I use QB online for my personal expenses as well as for a small swimsuit company that belongs to my fiancé. The linking system with QB and bank/credit card accounts is quite impressive. App could be confusing to some who do not have previous experience but it is somewhat simple to learn.

The only thing I would like to be able to do on QB Online is enter transactions into an account as I would be able to in QB desktop version. Entering expenses (not using the bank account linking) can be very tedious using QB online."
Awesome app, love QuickBooks. Use it often to add expenses and check bank data. Nice feature of receipt photo, works great
Hate it. I officially hate this program and will be changing to another accounting software in July. I have been using quickbooks since 2000 and used to love its simplicity but it has become time consuming and harder to use. Make a mistake...can't fix it. If you are away you can' access all the feature using the app - you find a computer and log on.
Very easy to use. The app is fantastic as it is very user friendly and has everything I need. I've used MYOB in the past and that was terrible compared to the QuickBooks app; which is in line with the times.
New to qb app. Love it
"Pretty good. Got an iPad so I could use QBO on the run because I found out pretty quickly the app on my iPhone was useless for my needs. Loved using my iPad until I tried to print invoices. Wouldn't work which was aggravating since I had time constraints. I had to wait until I was at my computer to take care of it. 

I had been using QB Mac Desktop and was very happy until QB told me I had to switch before the OS upgraded. There have been a lot of glitches along the way with the online program. I must say customer support has been awesome. If they can't fix the problem they suggest letting the engineers know so they can take the suggestions and make changes. Basically, QB Online is a work in progress."
Great, just like the web app. Love to have these tools handy. Recommended.
Great app.. Great app
Great app. I actually love this thing. It's pretty easy to use once you come to understand some of the functions. Daunting at first but learning curve isn't too steep. Helped me make sense of my numbers.
Nice app. Excellent app
Buggy. App has been very buggy. For a few months I lost the ability to add expenses and not every time I click on home the app closes. Using brand new iPhone 7.
Quick books. Awsome app. Helps when your always on the go.
Great app!. One of the best apps I have used!
Superb. This accounting system and the app have saved me so much time over the last six months. I used to dread calculating the vat return and catch-up my up on the books but I am up to date daily with very little effort. Well worth the money!
Quick Books App. Absolutely love this app, its works fabulously well on my iPhone, and I can process things quickly and easily without having the panic of having to beside the computer 24/7. Great
Need to improve!. The sole trader app is great for what I do including logging travel however I am registered for GST and therefore cannot use it. I have to go to the online version and just discovered you have to buy the plus version to link to recommended logbook app. QB you need to provide GST to the sole trader app or at the very least provide the same logbook function for the other QB packages.
Good but could be better. Many features that are online, you cannot use in the app. Even the online version is limited.
Great & smooth accounting app. Very good up to keep on top of your finances . it's the best on the market.
Top notch. This app works great, easy to use after I played around with it for a bit. Very convenient and quick to use.
"So close - incorrect/unreliable customer and invoice data. So close...  run a decent sized lawn company with QuickBooks and the mobile app is so close to being what I need.  

Unfortunately where it falls short is the functionality I need the most in a mobile app: I'm on a call with a customer discussing their outstanding balance / open invoices...   while he balance is always up to date, at the invoice level , it seldom is.   Invoices created recently (not minutes but within hours or days don't show up at all under the custom but they're reflected in the balance).   Payments ?  Even worse.   I have customers with $0 balances but who's  invoices show as past due in the mobile app.   Neither problem occurs in the online web version of qbobline.   

It makes it unreliable and almost unusable.   I'm always having to tell customers I'll research and get back.   Fix this and I'd give it 5 stars...

Minor disappointments : can't enter journal entries or access certain account types like depreciation.  Again minor , overall this would be just what I need for our business without the two issues noted before."
Expenses are easy to track. Simple way to track expenses when out and about
"Bugs and bugs it a jungle. 1. Kicking out of the app very often.
2. Not able to email multiple invoices at one time.
3. Limited search capabilities. Cant search notes and description.
:("
QuickBooks mobile app. Greatest addition to my business I ever made!
PDF NOTE ON IPAD. Why can't we add a PDF note on iPad app. I can do it by accessing desktop version on ipad. But it's a pain doing it that way. It would be simpler to add that option to the app. Come on guys keep up with the technology. Quit lagging behind.
I love it.. I used to have to enter in expenses and sales, but now all that stuff shows up automatically with my banks being connected.  I love it!
App close by itself. Sometimes the app close by itself. This is really a struggle for me since sometimes I've already input a lot of information then the app just close without saving the information, and I had to re-input everything all over.... Waste a lot of time
Works well. Good app
Best in the business!. Im a general contractor, tracking and allocating expenses is easy, I take a picture of the receipts with my phone and stays stored in the cloud, really cool. I like it a lot
"Easy enough to use, works best with the online version. I'm only using this for the basics of bookkeeping, so it's enough for me.

The functions in the app is different than the online version, so I mainly use it to take pictures of invoices. I enter an invoice online, then snap a picture of the invoice using the app. I also use the app to quickly get a monthly total per supplier, which the online version doesn't have."
Love it. My entire business is conducted through my iPhone. Thanks QB for making life so easy!!!  Greatest app for any small business, hands down!!!
Great Program!. The Pc version is wonderful the mobile app is steadily on its way
Great app. The app is great for on the move and for keeping you up to date on invoice payments, you believe you can invoice from the app but we only use it for day to day updates
Quick books. Awsome app. Helps when your always on the go.
Love it!!!. App is easy to use and saves me so time!  Wish I did it a long time ago!
Book keeping made easy. With constant updates this is the go to program for my business! This app assists in daily activity and allows me to be on the move.
Absolute Magic. This app is brilliant it has made my account keeping so much Easter and better, I'm not loosing bits of paper everywhere and find it much simpler to keep on top of everything (I think me using this has made my accountant much happier too as it has reduced his work load)
Great app. Works great for managing customers and invoices for our company!
Co-owner. The best app ever made for small business owners!
Handy, but needs work. The app is pretty hand for some of my clients to invoice on the go or take photos of their receipts. I find it a little too dumbed down for my uses. I would love to be able to add delayed credits and charges and drill down on the financial statements. It would also be great to pull other reports, not just p&l and balance sheet.
Works well. Great app, easy to see what's going on at a glance
QB app fail. App is very frustrating. Sometimes works great but most of time wants to download company data and 15 min later still not downloaded. I try over and over and give up. Then every once in awhile it works. Fix or get rid of.
Good app and makes life easier. It's a easy app to use and simple to navigate.
Great app. Added immensely to efficiency of our business and interface with customers
Great mobile app, but it has a mind of its own. I've found the ability to work remotely as a great plus for estimates, electronic invoices and checking customer records. I have just had issues with downloaded deposit amounts and matching for reconciliation. Automatic entry into register has to GO!
Simplicity and ease. I am new to QuickBooks online but absolutely love how simple the app is. It creates time and space in my personal life.
Expected better.. For Quickbooks having been the leader for so long in small business accounting software, I expected more from their online format and their app. While it is great for quick, on the go stuff, you can't add accounts in the app. You have to log into the web version for that. Overall, I expected more and felt I stepped backwards in using online from the desktop platform I had used for years.
Best business app. I never write reviews but had to for QuickBooks. Absolutely love. Couldn't run my business without it. Have recommend it to everyone.
Great Software. With each update this app gets better and better, Great integration with turbo tax small business
very efficient. very efficient app, very handy
Superb. The app on the iPhone is great. Works perfectly and great for quick invoicing. The iPad app is even better as provides much more in depth information. Even better both apps work seamlessly with each other. Don't know what I would do without this app.
Easy to use. Love this app, easy to use.
Super efficient. This app has streamlined my workflow 100%
Business owner. This is the best app on the market!!!
Used to be happy.... I really used to love this app. But lately, it seems like it's always needing updating. The last couple of updates have been the worst. Are used to be able to add an invoice, save it, and immediately receive a payment. Now I have to go back out to the main menu to receive the payment. It's added A couple of extra steps that are unnecessary. I don't really understand the changes and even though I have expressed my opinion to QuickBooks, nothing has changed. It doesn't sound like a big problem but it adds extra steps to what was once an easy process.
"Awesome interface. Awesome app. That's what it says it will do. 

The only problem is when I log an expense it attaches receipts as images and not as PDFs. Also I do not like the image scanner it doesn't trim around the edges of the receipt. I end up having to use a PDF scanner and then attach the receipt in QuickBooks online in a browser."
Such an Awesome Time Saving App. This app saves so much time and effort for small business owners and probably business owners in General. Would highly recommend.
Great App. Loving it - I love keeping track of expenses on the go.
For the money this app is terrible. This app does not seem to sync in real time. For example an invoice setup on online quickbooks does not show here. Even the customer that was added online. For a large company making millions of dollars on these products it is not only unacceptable but it is also fundamentally wrong
Was getting better, now not so much. I use this app everyday to access QuickBooks on my phone and it's been great. The latest update changed the button to edit invoices and where to receive payments. Using the iPhone plus to edit invoices is impossible. It used to be at the bottom where it was easily tapped. Now it's right at the top and not easy to hit. Receiving payments is now really small squished in the middle of the screen. For me it's not easy to use anymore and actually frustrating. I've used QuickBooks for the lifetime of my business, if it stays hard to use I will have to switch. Businesses can't waste time billing people looking all over the screen for buttons that move around every update.
1 Step Forward - 2 Steps Back. For the most part, the app functions correctly after finally resolving the issues with accepting credit cards. Now, it wants to download the company information each morning. It is doing it on all the devices and accounts that our company uses. It's very frustrating when we need to quickly pull up a customers information only to be forced to wait for it to re-download all the info. Hurry up and wait
"Good accounting app, need faster improvement. I am a new user.  QBO is a overall well designed app.  Based on my 2 week use, the Tax Center needs improvement the most.  The tax calculation is an important function for Canadian companies.  The Tax Center is so inflexible and poor design.  Default tax rates and tax group cannot be changed.  Manually created Tax group cannot be deleted.  If you tried playing with making new tax rates or tax group, you may end up with a long list of useless names and messing your tax calculation, especially if you are  not working with it everyday.  Same problem was reported 3 years ago.

If you add a new expense item from bank statement downloaded, you cannot adjust GST/PST paid.  What you can do is after creating an expense item, exit and open the expense item again to correct the tax calculation.

Intuit please correct this tax Center issue as quick as possible."
David Hall. Great app , excellent for small business
Love it!!!. This app makes things so easy to keep track of a job while in the field and saves time.  Love it!!!!
Love this app.... Taking pics of receipts and storing them in the cloud is fool proof bookkeeping! The app also makes you categorize them on the spot. As the owner of an income tax business for over 15 years, this sort of documentation is bulletproof in an IRS audit. Every small business owner should be trained to use this app.
A difference. I show a difference between the bank and the GL, that does not reconcile but the app isn't giving me any Unreconciled items. It doesn't make any sense.
Could be better. This online app could be a lot better. Limited in what it can do, but not bad for the cost
"Small Business Accounting. Very helpful software for my business. Has everything from accounting software to expenses, to employee payroll and deductions. 
Has helped me become more efficient with my time. 
Makes estimating and invoicing more streamline."
Easy. Great app that is so simple to navigate, and dead easy for business novices. Well designed.
Awesome app, love QuickBooks. Use it often to add expenses and check bank data. Nice feature of receipt photo, works great
Great Business App. I truly do not know where my business would be without this App.
"Great app. I don't understand what some people are complaining about it. This app works great. 
Thank you"
Great App. This is getting better with each update it makes. I you this app everyday to run my practice and it makes it very convenient because I'm constantly on the road and I don't have to sit at my desk just to enter expenses or send invoices to clients.
Great App. I have been using it and it is good. Though I wish more features were added for suppliers.
"Sam. I havent logged in since. When I just launch the app, it says ""Device offline"" everytime.
Although i use alll other apps smoothjy, why this? 
I even tried deleting it and downloading again..."
Work. Great app especially for small businesses
"Slowly getting better!. New app is working great - I can take payments from within the app now VS using the GoPayment app and having to import the transaction. That saves a lot of time. Touch ID works! The Home page is very convenient in seeing my activity and P&L's. One thing that needs fixed is the ""Due on Date"" for invoicing. All of my customers are COD and even though I have this option selected it still invoices out NET 30 across all platforms (Mac, iOS and windows). 

Would love to see the option of allowing customer to add a tip in the future, like in GoPayment.

 All in all so far so good! Thanks guys!"
Worst ever app. I have no idea why is this app on app store. The moment I sign in it says your session is expired and you need it sign in again. Thats the only vicious circle of time wastage is what this app has to offer its customer. Worst experience ever
Hands down makes your business easier!. I've used QB for years. And and I've come and go thinking I'll find something easier. Today's version of QB particularly with the mobile app hands down makes it so easy for me to track everything I do in my business. Worth every penny you spend ... and oh ya ... it's a write off!
Super & excellent apps. Very user friendly application . I would recommend this software to other people
Great app. Great app for tracking all my company transactions. Love that I can get a tax report for quarterly reporting.
Pretty good..... I'm somewhat of a novice independent contractor/psychotherapist. I've been using quickbooks since 2014 and have been using the app for about a year. The dates of invoice reflect the date of service so this is helpful. I know for sure I do not use all features to their full capacity but it's worth the monthly investment for sure.
Management. Good online on the go, but it has too many breakdowns, constantly has crashes, and makes it frustrating when you needed, if there were another online app that I will use I probably would consider on changing, for something simple is probably the right one for many customer that used the app.
On track. Keeping track of daily expenditure, and the performance of my business is so much easier with this app.
Best accounting app. Easy to understand & learn
"Can't Offline Book Keeping.. It's terrible that you can't add expenses when offline. 

The app needs internet constantly and that's very frustrating as lots of my business is outside of network. 

Basically the app is useless if you don't have internet!"
Love qbo it's fantastic.. This app rocks. I can see they are adding more features.
WoW!. Really cool app! It's linked on all my device! I can make invoices on my phone and send it to my clients directly from email! Cool stuff!
"Mr. Recent updates have slowed both the phone and computer app to a crawl. Very frustrating. 

Otherwise a very good app on my phone."
"Only real option for online small business bookkeeping. Quickbooks on line is really the only workable online bookkeeping solution for small business.
It still needs a lot of work to make it worth what they charge for it.
Also be very careful when upgrading from one level to another. A very slick customer service rep had me upgrade to a level of service that cost twice what I was paying claiming that I would have a certain functionality that I needed.
In the end, not only did I not get what I needed, but I could not return to the basic level, unless I wanted to close out my account and loose all my data.
Still all this being said, as far as I can tell it is the best of what is being offered as a web based service."
Lagging after update. I just updated the app it is lagging on both my I pads.
Functional. Easy. Efficient. Beautiful.. What more can I say? I am an independent film producer that is often out of the office. I prefer this app to the web version on my laptop. Wow! This app alone makes the purchase of my iPhone 7plus worth every dime.
Fantastic app. Love love love this app. So easy to use, a must for any small business
Statement from app ?. Works great for me but I wish you were able to print off a statement from the app.
Intuit Keeps Working it But Stumbles on Occasion. I've been a QBO user for over 4 years now and run my whole one-man business on it. Each app version is a bit better than the last and they do fix bugs when notified. I continue to be happy to see Intuit continue to improve the app and the web interface. The latest version (5.2) of the iOS has a minor bug in the dashboard where bank and CC account balances were blanked out after the update but killing and restarting the app fixes it.
Great app. Great app saves time Works well recommend for chippys like myself :)
So Easy. This app is user friendly and intuitive. I like being able to see the reports and add attachments to expenses. Highly recommended for small businesses owners.
Great stable app that keeps getting better and better!. Gives me access to everything I want but I'm on the go or just don't want to pick up the computer or tablet.
App. Best app
Better improvement. App running better
Missing. Really enjoy the service helping me to stay organized, but the app is missing a lot of the features on webpage or desktop version
Getting better. I'm a consultant and a QuickBooks Pro advisor. I've used just about every version of QuickBooks since 1998 when I started. I've seen it evolve and grow sometimes for the better sometimes not so much... but fortunately the mobile version is improving. As a consultant the one thing I that would be beneficial would be the ability to enter billable time to a client from my mobile device. It's the one thing that's truly lacking in all mobile apps. Other than that this evolution has improved over the past two years substantially.
👍. Excellent App!
"Great app. Great app. Would be good to have a sales/invoice report that sorted by ""service date"". 
Thanks :)"
Not bad. Convenient app. Not as functional as Quickbooks Online, but it adds to its subscription's value.
Great App. QBO is a fantastic app for small business. It makes balancing the books easy and less time consuming than the old paper method. It syncs with your business accounts making the job of keeping track of your business accounts easy. You can get a snapshot of your business's finances, balance sheet, P & L from the report tab on the app.
Good App for business owners. I think the app does a good job with tracking expenses and billing. As a whole I think there may be better programs out there. Do you research before signing up.
Small Biz Owner. I can't function without this app. Perfect for the owner on wheels and phones constantly.
Great small business tool. Excellent on a laptop, dient handel banks with authentication dongles very well, mobile app doesn't handle them at all. can't do payroll from mobile. Receipt tracking is easy and works well. Reports and snap shots handy.
Best Business app. This is very helpful in keeping accounts Excellent app
"Not as good as it was.. Getting worse. Incorrect allocation of funds to invoices. The mobile app doesn't allow expense entering anymore (""we're working on it"" - November 16). Yes, you can see invoices and forward from the phone, but wouldn't want to do anything else. Come on QB, get your act together. U.K."
Quickbooks made simple. Though I'm still not totally familiar with QB in general the App definitely makes it much easier and convenient to use and track accounts activity etc.
The best accounting app I've used. Quickbooks intergrates seamlessly with your store all you have to do is keep track of your expensenses!
Best app. I am using this app for my business. It is so easy and accurate. I really like it.
Awwwwwwsomw. Great app totally get it
Awesome i just need to learn to use it. Its awesome i love it but im new to it so i have a little bit of trouble using some of the features but im sure i will get the hang of it with time n experience
QuickBooks. Great app. Excellent business account program to run my business from my iPhone.
Easy to use. I love my QuickBooks app. This is the first year my taxes will be done on time because I didn't have to spend hours at desk!
Can't create PO's through app. I use QuickBooks for 2 things mainly. To create Estimates/Invoices and send POs once the Invoice has been paid. I can't create PO's with the app so it's useless. I have to go to the website every time I want to create a PO. It makes no sense that they would leave this feature out.
Responsive to feature request. We have enjoyed the transition from the desktop QB to QB Online (QBO). The QB App was one of the deciding factors. Two versions ago, we made a request for support for a particular bank feed for updates that can be initiated from the app - such updates are already a standard feature in QBO. Well, just a couple of weeks later, the next revision of the QB App has the requested feature. We were likely one of many making the request. 5 Stars to the QB Team for being responsive. We are happy customers. Now, if we could only get a discount in the online version for having multiple business accounts...
Mobile version. Please make PURCHASE ORDER option available for mobile version. I can't send purchase order to vendors from the app
app doesn't show anything. The app version does not match the online QuickBooks. Most of the information is not accessible in the app.
Awesome app. I was hesitant going to the monthly subscription, but it has been awesome always having access to my business account. The app looks and works just like the desktop app on my Mac.
"Great App for Small Biz. This app is a great app for small biz. There are a couple of ""things"" I think need to be improved upon:

1. Syncs to bank account is double counting payments....not sure if it's me or the system but could not figure out why it was doing that other than if synced to a bank, don't ""receive a payment"" against an invoice appeared to be a work around. 

2. Does not synchronize correctly with PayPal accounts...again not sure if it's me or the app. 

3. It would be cool to see help links to how to videos imbedded in the app...had to toggle between the app and YouTube a lot. 

Otherwise it's a great platform. Thanks."
Perfect. Works great for my contracting business. I mainly use it for estimates and invoices.
"Can't do my expenses on the app. I've started using Quickbooks a few months ago. All was going ok but now I can't do my expenses on my app anymore. Can't take pictures of my receipts to add them to my expenses. I contacted them and they said they are dealing with it but still no luck after a few weeks waiting. Very frustrating. 
All other functions are working fine though. 
Depe"
What a life saver. I needed something to simplify the data input that comes with invoicing and dealing with the piles of receipts with the flexibility of not having to open up my laptop to do so every time.  When I saw a promotion to try out QuickBooks online with ability to have access on mobile devices I figured I'd give it a try.  It's been a life saver.  My account transferred seamlessly and quickly.  It eliminated having to manually enter my credit card purchases and bank account transactions because you can link those accounts right to QuickBooks and they update automatically.  I can take pictures of receipts right from my phone or iPad and take care of them immediately as well as emailing invoices or recording payments received right from my phone or iPad.  It's great having this ability on the go.  So far I've discovered that I do have to log onto the website directly to get more detailed/specific reports, but it's possible I just haven't learned how to do it yet via the app. Thanks for simplifying my life in this aspect anyway.  Hoping it makes tax season a little easier.
Works smoothly. Can't tell you how much time I've saved tagging receipts in this app. Simple and useful.
"Nice, But Not As Good As It Could Be. 8/19/16 Update
 Still not able to post deposits and merchandise returns from the app.  I would think those would be easy tasks to add.
  The last update seems to have slowed the app down quite a lot.  It also took away the ability to sign into the app using Touch ID.  That was very useful. 
  If you have the app open in the background then you can reopen it with a touch.  But, to open the app you now have to type in your password.  I'm not one who leaves apps running in the background all day.

Posted long ago:
Great for staying on top of purchases. But, it's too cumbersome to move around within the app efficiently.  
  Needs to have the ability to post deposits and merchandise returns/credits from within the app."
Multiple crashes. Multiple crashes when trying to add expenses on the iPhone.
So Easy. This app is user friendly and intuitive. I like being able to see the reports and add attachments to expenses. Highly recommended for small businesses owners.
Best App I've Used!. I started my small business with QuickBooks and I was able todo everything in one application! From sale receipts, expenses, lodging gst and more. I would highly recommend QuickBooks to all business owners
"MUST HAVE !!!. If you have a business that serves customers and you want to collect payment at time of service or later, you want this software along with its phone apps to do business in the field.
Your a fool if you don't !!!!"
Love qbo it's fantastic.. This app rocks. I can see they are adding more features.
Ok App. Easy to setup. Big difference between windows version and iPad version. Like the amount of critical info showed.  On the windows version all critical info is shown. On the iSO device not enough info shown. Like cash sale,
A Very Useful and User Friendly App. I started a business this year, I deal with realtors and property owners whom aren't living near me. I say this because I got on this app because i had to have a way to keep records easily and still do my work. And I have been grateful for this app since!! I have to say for me i like that I don't have to remind myself of bills not paid , and then it keeps records of materials bought and all business expenses with a few simple steps of connecting your bank and this app. They constantly update and add choices without making it ominous. So thank you QuickBooks!!!! Here's to another great year!!!
My dependable business partner. Over the years, as a small business owner, I have come to depend on QuickBooks. Initially that made me extremely nervous, but I have found that both the app and the online version have come to be dependable and it's very important partner in my business success. They have made the app even more intuitive. I recommend it!
Easy to use. Excellent app. Very straight forward to use. The only issue I have is not been able to raise purchase orders on the app. This is very important to me because of the nature of my business, other than that it's spot on.
"Long-time holdout. I've used Quickbooks desktop software since 1995. Over the past couple of years some of my accounting clients adopted QBO. I have not cared for working with it, as it felt very clunky compared to the desktop version. 

A couple of weeks ago I converted my own company file to QBO. I found that it doesn't feel nearly as clunky when you are using it for your own business. 

I very much like the iPhone version, which allows me to enter expenses on the fly. Also, I can send client invoices right from my phone. Very convenient. 

When it comes to generating a P&L or balance sheet, for some reason you can't do cash basis, only accrual. 

One thing I don’t like about QBO  online invoicing where you give the customer the opportunity to pay by e-check, is that after you get the notice that the customer has paid # you don't see the funds show up in your checking account for at least a week. I guess that's why it's free."
So so. The app is not the greatest. I've worked with better.
GARBAGE!. They update the app and completely remove support for iOS 8! I understand making a newer version only compatible with newer iOS, but why block legacy users all together?  It worked great on iOS 8 before, now the same version of the app  suddenly says I need to upgrade! I pay $30/month for this garbage!?
Great app !. Great app
"Company owner. You can't go in an manage users unless you have a desktop version that's just not acceptable I have an iPad Pro cost 3times what my computer cost it better get fixed or I am gone.Very disappointed. Also customer service can't help either
RG"
Pretty Complete Finance from Your Phone. I'm not too sure about the need for a separate app for payroll, but this does work as advertised for the most part.
Superb app. I'm an electrician and run my entire business on this app it's makes my life so easy :)
CEO. This is a really good app it has help our business in so many ways. It help boost our profit margin we have been able to close deals, and make invoices right on the spot. I recommend this for a lot of different business with QuickBooks online.
Pretty good could be great. This ties in nicely with the desktop version. It's not 5* purely because of the actual software not the app itself. The customising of the invoice isn't great and adding previous invoices when you first start isn't great but if you're not worried about that it works well!
Brilliant. I love the QB app. Can invoice on the job. Wish I'd used it sooner.
Works Great. This app works perfect for recording our small farms purchases and sales. It is very easy and convenient to use.
Great app. Works well recommend for chippys like myself :)
Great app. Love having access to most of the same functionality as my laptop
Simple. Simple easy to use, love the phone app.
"You need to understand accounts..... No App will replace an accountant - unless you know what you're doing you can run into troubles

Had trouble with bank account not balancing and can't put in bills which isn't helpful

The app is ok to view data but you need the proper browser online version to have a chance to do things properly (if you know what you're doing...)

Ps spreadsheet is so much easier cheaper  and quicker but this is the future apparently so you better deal with it"
Wonderful APP!!!. Couldn't sing the praises high enough. I run a small, single member managed LLC and the Quickbooks Online APP is everything I need. I can create and send invoices and sales receipts on the go, even have the customer sign right on my iPhone or iPad.
Nice app. This is a really good app and I would give it five stars except I keep getting an error message when opening up certain accounts from the chart of accounts.
"Instant customer service 👌. Great app for small to mid size business.  Phenomenal integration from windows 10. So far so good.  

Thanks."
"Excellent. Really good app. Carry your whole business in your pocket.
6 months of using it and it's excellent."
Does not show suppliers. Since update App does not show suppliers or let you add expense, which makes mobile app a waste of time
Best app ever. Perfect for my on the go style of operating my plumbing business!
Very good app- missing one feature. I've had quickbooks for 3 yrs- and love the new app- one thing missing is a milage tracker in the program- had one on the desktop version- so now I have to use a separate app to track business milage.
Great App. Awesome App
Owner. Great app nothing more to be said. Everything is so organized. I LOVE IT!!
The Good, The Bad & The Ugly. The app is fine, and the main QBO bookkeeping features are fine. The problem is the Payroll and Payments (merchant account) add-ons are poorly integrated with QBO. They are like 3 separate countries with lengthly border crossings. The main QBO linked immediately with our bank, but not so with Payroll and Payments, each of which has a separate verification process. Have spent endless hours setting and resetting, sending voided checks etc etc. After 2 weeks, Payroll and Payments still won't connect even though the main bookkeeping portion has been humming along. Even their software engineers can't fix it.
I love it!. Works great! Love the accessibility, I use the app to send invoices easily while I'm on the go and my clients can pay online, through the invoices I send them. Definitely worth every penny!!
Just works. Great app! No complaints, but my business isn't very big. Looking forward to QuickBooks scaling up with me!
Love it. This is a great app to keep your accounts up to date on the fly.
Changed my life..!. QBO has made the bookkeeping side of my business a dream. It has given me so much time back. If I forget the rest my business to run as smoothly, I would be a happy man…
Aaaamazing. I run a mobile and in home boutique and this app has been a life saver! I'm so happy with it!
Bad App! Bad App!. I loved the App... then it fell apart. I cannot get it to show current status on anything! Why is it so hard to keep a good App 'good' ??
Meh. Dislike so many things about the app and online version. I would really like the ability to browse through invoices for ex. Look at invoice #1 click next to see #2 and next to see #3 and the. Be able to reverse this. Unfortunaly this can't be done and one has to search specifically for an invoice by number.
Good stuff. The phone app is a good resource that compliments the desktop app. I have been using QB Online for several years and have found that it meets my business needs as a small consulting company with less than 10 employees.
The Most Powerful option for Business finances area. I love this app because I have access in my Mac and then I can move to my bed with my tablet and continue working on my Accounting so easy. The only thing that probably I would add is the access to the items, lists and charts through the reports, as is in the online and the Desktop Mac app.
Really useful. Great app allowing me to raise invoices whilst on site, confirm details with clients and syncs with the software back at the office.
Excellent software. Best products, excellent customer service, can't imagine how I would manage without it. Thanks QuickBooks!!!
Easy. Great app just what I need as a digital nomad.
Very Happy. This app makes my accounting work super easy, can't wait for all features to be available on the app.
Great easy to use. I love the Mobil app really lets me work outside the office.
"Finally happy with intuit. Every December I have thought about how much I wish I could switch to a different accounting software so this year I decided to try fresh books because I despised any intuit product that might require me to talk to their ""help center"" for a fee of course.  And while fresh books was really nice software it was lacking some of the features that I was use to having with my qb desktop pro.  So I tried out the qb online and had some issues with migration at first but the new stateside call center was extremely helpful and pleasant.  Now I'm using the phone app daily and bravo!  Intuit is finally making me happy to be a client of theirs."
Highly recommend. I highly recommend this app. I run my business with Quickbooks online and use this app daily. I use it to create estimates and invoices mostly but also look up look up costumers balances and run reports.
Fix it!!!!!!!!. When it works I like it, but when it flips out it is so frustrating. Every time they update it it takes another couple updates to fix it. Leave well enough alone!
Awesome. Amazing app perfect
Great app. Works great
Great accounting app. Very happy with my quickbooks app.
What a nasty app!. Was forced to start a trial just to open the app. Once registered and everything, I realised I don't like the app and wanted to cancel my trial as it said 'you can cancel anytime'. And that's when hell started. It's impossible to find info on how to cancel. Had to log into the desktop version on my phone and in order to go that you wait for a code sent to your email which never arrived. Tried again the following morning and once I was finally in my account, the site was so poorly built that it kept redirecting me to other pages and not the Help page where I was hoping to find out how to cancel. Finally had to log in from my laptop (after waiting for a new verification code) to find out you just let the trial run out. What a massive waste of time. Highway robbery. Disgusting!
MJM Quality Construction. Great app. I can work from anywhere with internet connection.
Good app, but could be better. The app is good but could be better with more functionality. For example not being able to add 'Bills' but you can add 'Expenses' a small change but would make the app much better.
Horrible customer service. Product is a great product but the customer service is absolutely horrible!!! I was on hold/on the phone with customer service just to be told to call back on Monday.
Perfect for my accounting firm. Love this app! It's perfect for my accounting firm to track our books and clients. I even like how it works with QuickBooks Online Accountant. 5 stars for all.
Jason MARQUEZ. This app according to me is best as it's not that complicated and makes my business easy, I've not used any other accounting app so I consider this very easy for any layman who is not very good in accounting. It could have had few more options like individual job closing so to get more accurate and decrease the paper work.
"Great app for Distributors. We can invoice and deliver on the fly without having to go back to the office to capture the ""in the moment sales"". Our accountant has access and was able to set our account up to match his categories for a fast and no worry tax prep."
Awesome app... Its amazing app and each update is awesome. But it's not as near the desktop in terms of functionality. Overall, if you use QuickBooks then its a must have..
Love QB Online. Fantastic! I previously used Quickbooks Desktop and online is liberating. I purchase supplies and immediately enter as expense, attach a pic of the receipt. Boom. Done. Easy to get at all my bookeeping data. I have a small side biz, selling stuff I make online at etsy.com and similar sites. So my biz model is simple. I don't worry about depreciation of assets, or have payroll roles. Now and then I sell in bulk to a distributor and invoice them with 15 day credit terms. QB online handles all that great. I do recommend consulting with a pro to set up your accounts and then walk you through how to handle transactions. 1-2 hours of that and away you go. I love QB Online
Expected better.. For Quickbooks having been the leader for so long in small business accounting software, I expected more from their online format and their app. While it is great for quick, on the go stuff, you can't add accounts in the app. You have to log into the web version for that. Overall, I expected more and felt I stepped backwards in using online from the desktop platform I had used for years.
Handy and convenient.. I love this app. It is easy to use and always have it all at office when you go to do bookkeeping there. Reports may be something to add so I could we what customer owe me. Thx
"App is ok but expected better. I recently switched to Quickbooks Online as my firm is growing. The app is nice and works well. However this an accounting bug that doesn't take into account COGS for non inventory items that have a cost assigned to them when setting up the product/service. 
This increases our work as we have to manually enter the cost of each item sold....this is ridiculous"
App. Great
Great app!. So easy to use, really makes a difference to be able to invoice and do payments on the move.
Very happy with qbo. It beats Invoice2go and is very friendly to use. No Doubt it's the #1 invoicing app.
"Excellent. This app is making a huge difference to our business management. Real time visibility of important financial data!

To improve, id love visibility of scheduled bills, plus ability to make part payments to invoices. 

Terrific!"
Owner. The customer service is horrendous. I have spent hours and hours on the phone with their people. They canceled my subscription when I went to fix something I can head no customer service. When I got the subscription issue corrected and then renewed my subscription they charged me twice for it, after that was corrected they canceled my subscription again. So when I needed customer service after that I could not get any customer service. Both of those times good cook it shut me down for a day each. A little while ago I got there update for their online version. Tonight I printed 50 invoices fold them and they do not lineup with my windowed envelopes. So I called customer service to get that taken care of. Their suggestion was go by different envelopes. Maybe I should buy a different software
I'd rather have a bootleg copy of 2002 QB on PC. This is my first rating of anything. I have a feeling that the folks at QuickBooks aren't done making a bad app and platform horrific. How would you feel about multiple glitches and straight up losing you money. They are a monster at that. I have been using this for about as long as it was out, and I can't take it anymore. If credit cards weren't accepted through QuickBooks, I would be gone. The best part is the constant denial of problems.
"Good and almost great.. The app has a LOT of functionality and allows me to save hours of work a month by seamlessly connecting to the online version. I like the ability to enter receipts and sales as they happen, before I forget or lose the receipts. 

The only thing this is missing to make it 5 stars is the ability to read and recognize receipts instead of just taking photos. Hopefully one day that will happen, but for now still a really, really good product."
Login' this app. Makes my life SO much easier. I can do everything on the go. Saves time! Love it!
Okay. I'm new to doing my own bookkeeping and find this product clunky and not very easy to use. Issues with importing transactions and program changing dates and the order compared to the bank. It's not very easy to see what account transfers are moving to/from. It's hard to distinguish credits for debits. Poor customer service. No good summary graphs. Slow to attach receipts. Multiple clicks to do basic things. Cuts off file names if there too long.
Good. Nice app
Business Owner. This app has all the features I need to run a small but quickly growing business.  Easy to navigate.
QB App. This app worked fine but up until this recent update there are a few glitches and it shuts down in the middle of updating and invoice!
Good but............... This app needs to have a debit option when adding expenses.  Also I am really frustrated at this moment, because your app keeps crashing on my iPad.  If theses 2 issues are fixed I would give it 10 stars⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
All the essentials in an app. Works good so far. Allows for quick sorting of transactions and gives all of the essential components for a mobile version. It would be nice to be able to work in budgets in app.
Excellent. Great mobile App from Intuit, QuickBooks online is great and although a bit different from the desktop version it has improved the way I work with my clients
Was great but can't add expense. I used this app all the time yet now I can't add expenses and take a photo of receipt. Something has changed help intuit.
"Too sophisticated for just personal budgeting. I have been using Quickbooks since 2006 and its predecessor before 2006. I only use it for my personal budgeting of 14 bank accts, 10 mortgages and 6 credit card transactions. Sometimes I cannot figure out how to enter a transaction (transfers between accts,  accepting matching transactions, credit card individual transactons versus balance payment) without creating a double entry or it cancelling out an entry. 
 Love, love, love the online version that I can access via iPhone."
Great, easy to use QUICKBOOKS APP. So many great features with this app, love it. So easy to use!
Only a trial. Would have been nice to know it was a trial only, I saw the in app purchase option but no where did it say trial.
So Efficient. Love this software, especially the app!
Great App. This is exactly what I need to manage my small business. It also keeps my accounting bills smaller.
Limited compared to Quickbooks Desktop. Quickbooks online is just OK.  It has some limits that did not exist in the desktop version. A lot of them have to do with assisted payroll.  For example, the app does not tell you each pay period how much of a contribution to pay towards Simple IRA's and give you a chance to indicate whether they were paid.  It just assumes it was done without giving you any notice.  Other limitations make it just OK.
Good. Nice app
Great! The App We Need, But Don't Deserve. I use it to run my 6 figure company! Everything works great and makes things tremendously easy
Great app. Love having QB on my phone to receive payments, send invoices and other routine activities.
Great App. I love it! It keeps everything organized!
Good app. It's a easy app to use.
Review. Not quite as intuitive as I expected but otherwise useful app
Very Handy Accounting App. This app is very useful to always have a snapshot of your business at your fingertips.
"Bad Idea. I downloaded to approve parole only to find I need a second app for that. Two out of three ""recognized"" transactions are inaccurate.

Back to my Mac for QB. Ugly app guys. Sorry..."
Great App!. Great app for small medium enterprises
Easy of use. I think the app will be great once I figure out how it works.
"Perfect for my small business.. I run my own home improvement business and started using QB online and the App based on the recommendation of my bookkeeper. It's perfect for what I need. I use it to invoice customers on the spot, received payments instantly, then deposit the check online using my bank's app. Year end I generate 1099s for subs and a P&L for my accountant. The snap shots and summaries keep me up to date with my business profitability. 

It is some of the easiest software I have ever used. I personally have not experienced crashes or bugs with it. The only limits are within my accounting experience. Not the apps fault. 

I'm keeping it and would and have recommended it to friends and other small business owners."
Superb. The app on the iPhone is great. Works perfectly and great for quick invoicing. The iPad app is even better as provides much more in depth information. Even better both apps work seamlessly with each other. Don't know what I would do without this app.
Quick books. Awsome app. Helps when your always on the go.
Immature!. This thing keeps popping up rate me rate me please! Well so here you go I'll rate you. We got QuickBooks online and paid for the whole year to try it out thinking we can always come back to the downloaded version. It is very limited...... you cannot customize your invoicing or estimates at all very very limited. You definitely are much better off using some other kind of software for your estimating and invoicing purposes but wait that defeats the whole purpose of using QuickBooks online. Yes it does and is such a pain in the you know what. So far I'm sticking with joist for my estimating and invoicing until QuickBooks releases a much better customizable online version of QuickBooks online. By the way joist is free. QuickBooks online charges you arm and a leg and they got three different tiers so basically if they don't get you on the way in they'll get you on the way out. Overall I am disappointed with QuickBooks online!
Great App. Love using QB vs the other one I was using. Well worth the money IMO.
Very helpful.. This is a great app for writing invoices on the road, it's been very helpful!
Love this app!!. I love how easy to use this app is but my only problem is that I can't sync it with my company's OCBC account and my shopify's store's inventory.
Can't take payments in the app.. New app is working great, but I would love to be able to take a customers payment within this app instead of having to go back and forth between GoPayment and QuickBooks apps. One of these days.  One of see days.
"Superbly designed. Having used two competitors' products before, I've been very pleasantly surprised with Quickbooks. It's really easy to use but, at the same time, it has lots of really helpful features. 

The app is well designed but my only gripe is that I am sometimes unable to log-in. The problem usually corrects itself after a while, but it's a bit annoying when I need it at the time. Nevertheless, the product is so good that this doesn't even bother me much."
Good App. Works for me.
Great app. Convenient. QuickBooks app is very easy to use and makes tracking expenses quick and easy.
If you don't have time to troubleshoot, maybe find another program. After using the trial period, I bought and paid for a subscription...BUT, days have gone by and I'm unable to use the program because QuickBooks thinks the trial is expired and I'm not subscribed. Called QuickBooks (fyi-they're closed sundays) and they say they can do nothing on their end... So in the mean time while I'm waiting for Apple's response, days of paid use are going to waste, my business is in limbo, I can't bill and get paid($0 cash flow!!!), and the burden is on me to figure out how to get apple to tell QuickBooks that I have subscribed. Now I wonder if this program will regularly make my life miserable by consuming my time constantly putting out fires because of their program instead of it being an asset....
Great App!. This app has saved me tons of time and I love it!
Great stuff.. I like this app. (My extensive review).
Time saver. I highly recommend this app, specially for small business. Quick, easy and in combination with Service M8 it's all I need.
Love the app. It is amazing to see how well the app learn how to categorize expense! The design and ui are also amazing!
Great. App used to be useless while desktop version did what I needed. Now app is highly functional and I use it constantly for my business. Great, reasonably priced. I highly recommend.
So easy to use!. This app is easy to use!  I like it more than the desktop version!

Missing Functions. Great app for its current functions but it is missing functions such as entering Bills while on the road. Most of my purchases are on accounts so it leaves me doing my book work at home like the old systems.  If this gets added I will stay a happy user if not back to one of the other competitors.
It won't let me do the initial sign in. The first time you sign in, it wants to send you a verification email. But when you touch the menu item to send the email, it immediately says too much time has passed. No matter how many times I try, it just immediately says too much time has passed. So I ended up visiting the site via mobile Safari instead. The app just doesn't work, at least for me. And there doesn't seem to be a support option.
Great efficient and cost effective. This app is great and accounting system is too. Best value for the money and easy to use.
Subscription bug driving me crazy!. For the last few weeks the Quickbooks app has been unusable! It alerts me that my subscription has expired and will lock me out of any activities. I have been on the phone with tech support, my subscription is up to date, it gets fixed for a day and then the problem re emerges the next day.  This is an excellent app when this problem does not exist.  I use a fully updated ipad pro.  Please fix this bug!
Great app. There is no other app like it. This is probably one of the easiest apps to use and it is very user-friendly. I use it for my business and I have instant access on my iPhone. You can send invoices on a moments notice.
sales tax calculation is wrong. when creating an invoice, the app does not honor customer's sales tax setting. it applies tax even on customers with tax turned off. please fix asap!!!!
"Excellent Application. This has been an excellent application for use in developing a new Small Consulting Business. Everything is captured and it produces clear Reports.

To date though, I haven't been able to find in the Expense section the ability to make and register regular 'monthly payments' (such as regular monthly insurance payments which remain the exact same expense month to month). Naturally that doesn't mean the App doesn't have this capability - perhaps I'm just a Luddite who can't find it!

However, it really is a great application, very easy to use and well worth the expense."
QuickBooks. Works great . Happy with the app
Great but needs improvement. App is really great other then one key thing missing. I need access to employees and doing pay-runs while on the go and be able to enter in employees hours for casuals with ease.
Great app!. Only change would be to allow for a larger job location field. Other than that I can honestly say it's helped us tremendously with invoicing.
Loss of functionality. I had been using this app for a while without any real issues.  However, recently the 'expense' button that pulls up from the '+' menu on the home screen is grayed out...thus rendering the app fairly useless on the go!  Intuit said they unfortunately didn't have the ability to fix issues with the app.
Great app. Found this app so easy and user friendly for our small business 😃
Great app. Even better than the desktop version.
Great as an assistant to the desktop version.. I've found this app to be a great mobile partner to the full desktop (or online) version. There's a couple functions that aren't available in the app but everything you DO need is easily available. I can't connect my bank account because my (non US) bank isn't listed but being able to input expenses as they happen is a great way of keeping updated accounts. Reconciliation is a breeze afterwards. It's a great app.
Fantastic App in all respects.. I've used QuickBooks for over 10 years. It has been great watching them evolve and adapt to the changes in demand and tech. They are ahead of the swell in my opinion
Awesome app. I really like this app, I can track all my incomes and expenses, it shows my net profit and everything else I could possibly need. I really enjoy using this app.
Love this app!. I love this app! Having this has simplified how we run our business and makes it extremely easy to professionally deliver our product to our customers on the go!
Like it!. Just started with qbo - the app is actually really good
Very nice to use. Great app
Great App love it !!!. Makes my work so much easier
Excellent app. Easy to use. Makes record keeping on the go a snap.
Great App!. At first, I thought that this app was pretty clunky and I didn't enjoy using it. In the last couple of years or so, it has gotten considerably better. I really like using it now.
Great accounting app. I have been using this app on multiple devices, so far the iPad version is the easiest to use.
Brilliant. Excellent accounting software for new small business. Only issue I have is that I bought a subscription online and the app keeps telling me to subscribe
Great software for small business.. Only complaint is that I'm always greeted by a pop up, asking me to rate the app, which I grow weary of, so here I am.
Excellent for businesses in the go!. Quickbooks is easy to use and the app allows me to create transactions, view balances and customer information wherever I am. I also LOVE that I can take a photo of a receipt and categorize it on the go.
Good app. I have used this now for two years.  It works well.
Great app!. Our company switched from Quickbooks desktop to the online version which came with the option to download the app. We now use the app more than online. We handle estimates, invoices, payments, banking and more directly in the app and on the go. The app has a simple and clean look making it easy to navigate. To date we haven't had any issues with it. We are excited to finally be able to get things done in less time!
Great App But.... I love the app; works great for invoices and customer information on the go... however it would be nice if I could get more detailed reports and accounting information on it too... that's my only real complaint but you can still use a computer for that -- miss those reports when I'm away from it though.
Class reporting is needed badly for the app. Without class reporting this app doesn't provide a lot of use for someone with multiple locations.
"Problems. This app will not let me save an invoice, it always says ""this number already exists"" no matter which number I add. Only started the error on the 30/11/12, please fix."
Not working. Great app when it works which is 1% of the time between it crashing and freezing I cringe every time I have to use it on the road
"Getting better all the time. Still needs tweaking.. I use this app for my business every day, and the mobility is excellent. Saves so much time in paperwork.

I've been waiting for a couple of fixes for a long time:

1. There is no way to change whether a discount is before or after tax as in the desktop and iPad versions (it's locked to discount after tax and to change it requires logging in on another device to make the change).

2. I'd love to see a couple more report options, particularly Invoices by Month as on the iPad version.

Other than having to log in on another device for these things, it's solid and I'd encourage anyone in a similar business (service industry) to use this app."
I'm a fan. I use this app almost daily now. Was stuck on my computer and was not will to try it. But happy I did.  Joe I do accounting in the go.  Thanks quick books
Where's suppliers gone. Since update App does not show suppliers or let you add expense
"Alternately great and lousy.. After all this time, they still refuse to make tiny minor changes that would make this app infinitely better. I have conversed with them a number of times and gotten a number of promises and it just never happens.

They have now added an additional layer of security that makes it very difficult to use this as a mobile app. It has cost me money twice. The story I Get from SUPPORT is that it was a decision made in the ""board room"" and their is no work around. Every time you use this app from a new location you are required to enter a six digit code that is emailed to you.  Their system is S L O W generating emails. If you are wanting to use this app in the field it's difficult. I am looking for new software.

Marketing with postcards by date is still very difficult. It's a problem I was promised a fix for over 10 years ago. 
The APP updates every time you open it, so your computer thinks it is a new program.

The suddenly and without warning added a new level of security to the on-line and Windows app versions that that requires an email verification. I had a task that should have taken 60 seconds and after 10 minutes trying to fix it myself and another 45 on the phone with tech support, I was invited to call back in the morning.
I am looking for another program.
Recently they have taken to making unnecessary changes without warning."
Great app. Been using for over a year now for keeping track of time for my construction business. Works great
Very good app.. Really like this app.
Disappointing Absences. So disappointing that I cannot see Qty on Hand on the app. Also, limited reporting on app!
Solid except.... I like that it keeps sync of everything smoothly. There's no wait time, and if so I never notice it. It's fast and convenient. Best accounting software hands down! The App is smoother than the Mac Desktop version, this should be fixed!
What's happened?!. Usually excellent for uploading expenses it's now decided not to allow the option to add an expense. What's going on? Please fix!!
"Sign in issue. Great app, except the need to confirm with text or email EVERY TIME upon sign in!!
Would have rated higher with out this issue.
Very frustrating"
"Good app. QuickBooks is just about perfect for my small business, one addition I would like is to be able to easily see a ""spend per customer"" button so I can easily add up the amount any repeat customer spend per year/month."
MGRM. Great app
Tremendous. Great app been using QuickBooks over the years on desktop version specially go on mobile is the best way to go there is a couple tweaks that need to be worked on for example keeping track of inventory etc. and so forth been using QuickBooks Pro help ticket update these features as QuickBooks from other than that it's a starter
Fix it. Quit making me sign in again and telling me my session expired.. there are multiple safety factors already in place that should allow me to open my app and go to work
QuickBooks Online. This app has been very helpful for me a small business owner. However the new update has been very frustrating for me as it automatically signs you out and the home page shows your gross income. I wish there was a way to make it private.
Easy to use. This app has been a life saver for starting a business and trying to keep the records straight. Makes it easy for my accountant to access my records. Good job QuickBooks
Crashed when entered a sales transaction. Downloaded this app to see if I could use it instead of at a computer and the app crashed as soon as I tried to enter a sales transaction. I tried to enter in the receipt type and it crashed
"Very satisfied!. Been using the mobile app for the past 2 months now, and I can say it does everything I need. Very easy to issue invoices, receive the money, match, reconcile the bank, calculate the VAT! 
The support people are very helpful and have a lot of patience!"
Fab. Brilliant app that updates instantly, giving a visual handle on your business at any time. Thank you
Expiring sessions suck. It's a great app and I'm using it all the time but the expiring sessions are infuriating. If you let us use touch id or a pin, don't make our session expire and force us to use our password! It completely defeats the purpose of pin/touch id. It doesn't increase security, it's just super annoying. No other app that utilizes touch id does that - not even my banking apps.
Before update great after horrible. I have been using Quickbooks for over 15 years. There always coming out with something new and most the time it works very well. This particular update makes it so I cannot except credit card payments via the app anymore. Trying to get in touch with customer support or get any help on this issue has been a few hours of wasted time. Still don't know what's going on I'm assuming this is their a way to force go payment users to buy the new chip reader so they can continue to except credit cards in day-to-day business. If you're reading this trying to decide to update and you use the standard headphone jack card reader and want to still receive payments via the app do not download this update.
Great. Nice app! Works well for what I need!
Great for small business owners.. Awesome app. Very convenient and keeps the finances and work orders organized. Takes some trial and error but well worth the effort to learn this system. You tube has many instructional videos on how to expedite learning this program.  Price is reasonable for what you get. Don't hesitate to get it. If anything you will learn something.
Keeps locking up. The app keeps telling me I need to update to the latest version, but I already have it. It won't let me log on. Frustrating.  Please fix or revert back to previous version until glitches are fixed.
"App crashing. After updating to the new version, app is crashing.  Kindly resolve the issue.

Not able to use"
"Where's the Touch Password?. I use Keychain so my Quickboks password on my Mac is super random, with dashes and strange symbols. I use QuickBooks on my iPhone so I can QUICKLY add expenses when on the road and don't have a Mac nearby.

Please add the Touch Password feature back in so the iPhone app is convenient again."
"Awesome App. It's very user friendly and informative. 
I really like how easy it is to assign an expense category and the convenient display of the profit / loss feature."
Quick Books app. It works as good as my computers program! I can do the work I need to right from my phone!
Latest Update crashing on iPhone 7. App crashes 2sec after being turned ON on iPhone7. Restarted phone, no luck
"Great for Business, especially if you drive a lot!!!. This app is great as well as the self employed app! Make sure you do your invoicing all on one. They don't work together and have to re-enter on desktop or QuickBooks app.
You can select personal or business for mileage and customize trips. 
All in all this is a great app!"
MGRM. Great app
Amazing app. Amazing app it's really easy to use.
"So far so good.. Love the app.   I think it's great any time I can give an estimate, invoice on the road.   

Thanks."
I seriously hate QB online & the app. Coming from QB for mac, the learning curve has been awful. So many things that should be intuitive aren't, and too many, seemingly little, functions don't exist in these versions, which makes my job so much harder. I wish I could switch software, but it's what my cpa uses, so I have to use it too - ugh!
Best App ever!. I run my whole totally green business from my 📱all because of this APP. It makes business seem so easy!
Great App. I wasn't sure how much I would use this app, but the ability to check status of accounts and stay on top of basic needs while out dealing with clients has me sold.   Could have more functions but I'm not sure it needs to.
great. great app
QBO is pretty good. The things I don't like about QBO is that I can no longer do a search for an address to find the customer name if I can't think of it, and the search options are very limited which is very disappointing. Also you can pull up a customer through search, attempt to click on the name which then reverts back to the list where you started the search and doesn't go to the client. I do like the portability and that I can look up customers on the road and I like the ease of emailing invoices and estimates. This definitely needs improvement to come up to the desktop version.
QuickBooks Online is a lifesaver!. We have a small family owned and operated business. I love the simple user interface that QuickBooks online uses. It's very easy to get started with and it saves us so much time. The reports are clean and well put together and it gives me so much flexibility when categorizing expenses. It also integrates perfectly with our Square card reader and gives us the option to attach receipts. All around perfect bookkeeping software for people on the move!
Pretty but not functional. It's bizarre how the graphics continue to be improved but the functionality doesn't. I've been trying to use this app for years but the features I need on the go are missing such as timekeeping. Mostly this app seems to work a lot like you would imagine Quicken mobile to work, by being able to look up past banking transactions. But I can do that on my banking apps for free already.
"Superb!!!. This is a great app for keeping up to date with accounts.
Links to my bank accounts and intelligently matches transactions and remembers previous matches and entries.
Certainly deserves the name QuickBooks based on how quickly I can enter my bank transactions.
Great for multi-user access and very easy to set up.
Overall this is much better than I expected."
Tremendous. Great app been using QuickBooks over the years on desktop version specially go on mobile is the best way to go there is a couple tweaks that need to be worked on for example keeping track of inventory etc. and so forth been using QuickBooks Pro help ticket update these features as QuickBooks from other than that it's a starter
Helpful. It's a very convenient app, I use it all the time and it's been the best!
Very good app.. Really like this app.
"Superbly designed. Having used two competitors' products before, I've been very pleasantly surprised with Quickbooks. It's really easy to use but, at the same time, it has lots of really helpful features. 

The app is well designed but my only gripe is that I am sometimes unable to log-in. The problem usually corrects itself after a while, but it's a bit annoying when I need it at the time. Nevertheless, the product is so good that this doesn't even bother me much."
Outdated. The iPhone app is way better and has more features including hours and quantity in invoicing. This app really needs updating
Quick Books App. Have been using quick books app for my business for a few months now, and I am very impressed with the package, as it's great value for money. I enjoy being able to use the app on my phone as it offer all the services that I need to be able to quickly raise and send invoices and pull up important info.
Newest download...  Not so hot. I rarely write reviews but feel it's time...  I love many things about QBO WHEN i'm ONLINE the problem is i'm often times NOT online when I'm working which forces me into extra work in order to maintain my QBO account feeding it data when I get back online.  I've been using QBO for for several years now and have been a fan of it's Apps.  The mobile apps should have the ability thru the QBO Apps to download and store data on iPhone and iPad working from this data while offline and syncing new data to their servers when i'm back online.  The who entire purpose of MOBILE is to be just that MOBILE and working from anywhere.  Intuit your blowing through the philosophy of mobile and dictating to us how WE should work.  You work for US as we give you our money for a service.  It's a good service BUT THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE STILL!!!!!
Research before you buy. Program works ok but has a HIGH learning curve. Also apps have restrictions on what you can do. Cannot post new checks in apps. Cannot log onto the website from a mobile device.  Reports are limited. I do not do invoicing and use it mostly for my accountant, and I'm still learning so the final jury is still out but from what I've seen so far I can't give it a higher rating.
Printing receipts. How come you cannot print receipts on the app after you have put a payment through
"Could be great. This app takes care of basic needs but it could be amazing.  I'm unsure of why intuit chose to cut the corners it did.
Examples:
There is no check option in the +
There is no bank deposit option in the +
Tapping my bank acct on the home page takes me to my chart of accounts. Huh?
There needs to be some polishing."
Awesome app. Helps with all business expenses and just great interface
Appliance Men. Great app.. 💯.   all you need to run your small business on the go ...   team it up with Square for the ultimate in portability   Team both up with an IPad and you have excellence
Great as an assistant to the desktop version.. I've found this app to be a great mobile partner to the full desktop (or online) version. There's a couple functions that aren't available in the app but everything you DO need is easily available. I can't connect my bank account because my (non US) bank isn't listed but being able to input expenses as they happen is a great way of keeping updated accounts. Reconciliation is a breeze afterwards. It's a great app.
Works for me!. I love this this QuickBooks app can cross platforms. Every entry is accounted for in a matter which device I use (and I have a ton). As with anything, there are glitches but they do not stop production. Like everything can't be perfect all the time and with the constant improvement, bugs are expected here and there.
Owner. App is a great convenience
Excellent. The app is a great supplement to the online version when I'm on the road. I easily make customer invoices, add expenses that I have purchased. Nothing is lost or forgotten. Great way to keep everything up to date
"Impressed. I put off upgrading to online version after using Quickbooks pro for five years, struggling to enter online direct debit expenses and payments. Online version makes entering data easy and efficient. Such a time saver for me. Well done intuit! 
Definitely worth the monthly subscription fee."
No more iOS 8 support. Disappointed that App developers are dropping iOS8 support. Not everyone upgrades the second Apple comes out with a new iOS
More than convenient, it's necessary. Having the app makes it so much easier to do business on the go. You can send estimates and invoices before the client meeting has even ended. Efficient and essential!
Very happy with qbo. First of all I'm saving a lot of time versus I tried so many apps. I even had qbo one time and canceled hoping I can win. Not really QuickBooks online is the only way to go. Very straight forward.
Multiple Companies. Love the app when it's working properly. Doesn't switch between companies well, it'll show customers for my other company under the wrong account and makes it impossible to actually work from. I'm sure if you just have one business account it works fine.
Easy to use and great for tracking transactions. Navigation is straightforward and the software updates quickly
Highly recommend this app. I have a mobile veterinary service and use this for all of my billing while I'm on the road. It saves me time by allowing me to bill my clients on site at the time of service, and even process the credit card if they choose to pay that way.
Getting better with every upgrade.. Great app. They do lure you with the free use then hit ya with the charges later. I think it's a useful tool in the toolbox.
could be better. it doesnt give you an option to enter a vendors bill on the app, its not convent to aways have to log onto a computer to enter a bill. you arent even able to review outstanding vendor bills etc on the mobil app
NOT BAD. Pretty nice app.  Went from desktop manufacturing to Quickbooks Online.  I like having access to my books while at craft fairs and being able to use different devices.  Still needs some work -- it's been weeks and my GoPayment account is still not linked and now find out the Online doesn't accept/recognize the chip reader.  Square app is more robust and may use that instead.  Also would be helpful to have a mileage tracker.
Great app. I am enjoying staying on top of things while on the go.
"Missing some elements, overall good. I like this app. Great to be able to give client receipt right away. Wish we could do deposits and reconciliations and change default ""payment due"" area."
Excellent app for small biz on the go. Invoice from anywhere. Super easy.
QB online. Very very good in all aspects of accounting. From home office or mobile app. You can do it all!
Awesome app!. Really useful app!!!
GreT App. I Love this app but the reason I didn't give it a 5 is because when you enter an expense with the app and write who you paid and save the expense when you go to the computer it does not show who you paid. That field is blank.
Great App. This has transformed my business. It is so easy to use that I now do my accounting on my cell phone.
Mileage tracker. Any chance you can put a mileage tracker on this app? Other wise it's perfect for small business
Great App for business.. A ++ Must have app
Statement from app ?. Works great for me but I wish you were able to print off a statement from the app.
"Getting better all the time. Still needs tweaking.. I use this app for my business every day, and the mobility is excellent. Saves so much time in paperwork.

I am waiting for a couple of fixes in the iPhone version.

1. There is no way to change whether a discount is before or after tax as in the desktop and iPad versions (it's locked to discount after tax and to change it requires logging in on another device to make the change).

2. I'd love to see a couple more report options, particularly Invoices by Month as on the iPad version.

Other than having to log in on another device for these things, it's solid and I'd encourage anyone in a similar business (service industry) to use this app."
Good app and getting better. Really good features and helps when you are on the run. New reporting and features have been added which gives you quick company snapshots whilst you are away from the office
Works and convenient. Easy way to enter sales and expenses. I've had no problems with this app.
Update. Says update required to use. I go to the App Store to update and no update is available. Been using it and working great till this.
Very good app. Good
App not working since update. Normally I'd give the app 4-5 stars but every time I log in now it says sign in successful but there is no online account associated with the email and to start a free trial. However when I login from safari, I get in no problem. Please fix as I am unable to access data from my phone.
"It's Happening. The Quickbook people are really developing this app and there complete system, from a very poor beginning the app is is really strong now and very functional, please keep up the good work Quickbooks People. 
Highly recommended book keeping system."
Great App. This is getting better with each update it makes. I you this app everyday to run my practice and it makes it very convenient because I'm constantly on the road and I don't have to sit at my desk just to enter expenses or send invoices to clients.
App keeps crashing. Keeps saying the session is over when I sign in and logs me out
Be careful. I loved this app for 10 months. Then an error occurred and I lost access to my business. Only cost me $200 for one time fix. For $600 I could have purchased a 3 month fix. The risk exceeds the benefit.
"Forced to upgrade to iOS 9 - pathetic!. I personally like the iPad app better than the online version for interface, but it has so many bugs!  Constantly gives me error message that I'm not authorized to do something (add/edit a customer, etc.), but then it lets me do it.  But I keep having to close out all the error messages that pop up.  Often won't let me email an invoice.  Won't let me add customer off of creating a new estimate (have to add customer, close, then do estimate and choose customer again).  The list of basic things that should not be an issue goes on and on.  On the iPhone app, there is no place for my reps to view the contact person's name at the company!  I'm sure there are other things I could think of, but I've just learned to compensate and work around things.  However an app with this many bugs should not be out there - it's pretty pathetic!

UPDATE 11/18/15 - after update, all the previous bugs are still there.  Pathetic to issue an update and not fix what was wrong!

UPDATE 1/14/16 - even worse!  Now I can no longer add an item to an estimate or see the customer name on Estimates or Invoices under ""Activity"". What is wrong with you people?  If you can't make it better, leave it alone! Now it is completely useless!

UPDATE 11/7/16 - I absolutely HATE you for forcing me to upgrade to iOS 9!!!  I have been suffering with Quickbooks iPad's pathetic bugs for well over a year.  I am forced to use it for my job because my laptop is old and I hardly ever pull it out anymore.  Everything I do is on my iPad.  However, I have an older model (not by years, but by model) and after the mess updating to iOS 8.3 created for me, I vowed I would never update again!  NONE of the other apps on my iPad have forced me to do this.  App developers are generally sensitive to the fact that not everyone chooses to disrupt their life by updating their device and spending days having to learn to use it all over again (and deal with whatever new bugs it brings to the table).  You must have the absolutely lowest level of developers out there who first, couldn't fix even simple bugs in your app (like telling me every time I set up a customer or did an estimate ""I wasn't authorized to do it"" and then warning me if I got out of it all data would be lost.  But it wasn't and everything I did was still in the system.  Even our boss got this message and she IS the administrator).  There were a myriad of other quirks we had to work around and now your solution is to release a new version, but in so doing force everyone to upgrade to iOS 9 because your developers weren't smart enough to know how to make it work with previous iOS versions???  Shame on you!  You would get 0 stars in my review if I could and if this new version isn't totally bug free, you will REALLY hear from me!"
Needs a lot of work. Very disappointing they removed card payment facility, only reason I went with quickbooks over Xero. Also don't try and do anything within app or your accounts will get into a right mess (things like match a payment or transfer) you will end up with duplicate transactions that can only be deleted by logging into web client. Upsetting the company that all those years ago changed the industry (and took on Sage) have failed so badly.
Doesn't work for ipad. This app doesn't even load my company info. It keeps returning error trying to load company info. I have contacted quickbooks a number of times and all they say is they are working on the issue and to use a web browser version in the mean time. I have seen about 4 updates released and not one of them has fixed this issue. When will this be fixed?
Just works. Great app. No complaints yet, but my business isn't very big.
"Great App!. Really handy to be able to use my phone to raise invoices or make them as paid when I check my internet banking on my phone too.
It means I can check them paid while I'm out and about and it syncs with my computer without telling it to. It also means my bookkeeper can also sign in from their office and do the bits they need to do each month for a bank rec etc. 

Some bits don't always match up when you do it on the app but it's easy enough to edit on the computer."
Great F-ing App!!. I love this app, everything syncs over so well from the web version. It's very simple to use and makes my job a hell of a lot easier!!
Problem fixed!. App works great!
Quickbooks. This app is excellent and the version on my computer is even better save's me hours when quoting well worth the money.
Love this app!. I have my own business and quick books makes my life a lot easier.
Life saver. Apart from the fact I have to input my password every time, this app is a great compliment to the version I use on my laptop. So easy to use, can invoice on the spot. Very happy.
"Keep getting ""Session Expired"" message with every log in attempt. Completely makes the app non-functional for on the go business. Critical flaw!  Please fix it!!

Oh, and the link for support is dead...   come on folks, gimme a chance here!!"
"Improving but still a long way to go. Like the new dashboard, but need ability to set YTD totals, more report options, does not show all my bank accounts.  

Needs to be more customizable. 

App does not replace the website version, which is still needed to do any real work.

Best feature is the easy way it handles the bank feeds."
Excellent Product. Great for sending estimates and invoices on the go. Everything I need to see right at my fingertips and very user friendly.
"Keep getting ""Session Expired"" message with every log in attempt. Completely makes the app non-functional for on the go business. Critical flaw!  Please fix it!!"
Couldn't run my small biz without QB. Have used for 4 years.  Always learning new things.  Have a great customer service / support.  Very user friendly for us biz owners who don't have a background in billing / payroll.
Time saver. I was hesitant to move from the desktop version to online but thought I would find the auto-import and document storage worthwhile. After a week I'm thrilled since the majority of my time using Quickbooks was spent doing data entry for expenses and sales receipts. The online version now lets me auto import square and PayPal and tracks the processing fees so there's only a quick review to make sure the transactions are accurate, which they have been. My credit cards linked up and downloaded several months which once I matched a did the first reconcile were accurate. Time consuming data entry for charges, square sales, and other transactions are a thing of the past. Even sales receipts in the online version include a deposit account so there's no second step like the desktop version to record a deposit. Plus the mobile app and camera feature to record receipts and documents has saved filing time. I'm happy I made the change and anyone new to quickbooks will find the online version easy to use.
Dashboard is a great. The most recent upgrade gives users a real time understanding of a companies finances through graphical representation.
"Love it. So easy and confident love this app 
Great for my freelance makeup business"
MGRM. Great app
"Needs SPLITSCREEN SUPPORT. How can this app have as many revisions that its had since ios 9 came out and Still not have split view with other apps?? Also the glitch is back that when you hit the ""back"" button when viewing a customer it takes you ALL the way to the top of your customer list instead of going back to where you were. Frustrating..."
Great. App used to be useless while desktop version did what I needed. Now app is highly functional and I use it constantly for my business. Great, reasonably priced. I highly recommend.
"GARBAGE. This app is JUNK!!
Support for this app is useless
Looks like I will be going back to FreshBooks, it may not be a accounting solution but at least it works and I can import my info without manually entering.
My business doesn't have time for me to spend hours with support when I need to be taking care of my customers M-S support"
Great app.. Not as good as desktop. Its amazing app and each update is awesome. But it's not as near the desktop in terms of functionality. Overall, if you use QuickBooks then its a must have..
Works Sometimes. Account synchronization works sometimes. PayPal often stops working until I log out and log back in online. Bank account takes days to update. Not a great app. Integration. Integration needs  some work.
Like the App. I find the app to be very useful in the field. Unfortunately since the latest update adding new customers seem to slow the app down and to a crawl.  Wish there was a way to get that bug fixed
I love this app. This is the easiest to use and simplest way to use it.
Lacking features on the app. The online version is good and it has a lot of features. I hope to see them available on the app as well soon.
Great update. Prior to this current update I was wondering what the purpose of the app was. But I now have great is for it as it allows me to do more functions now while away from a computer great work
Great App. I was only half way pleased with the app before. But with the new upgrades and changes, it is almost fully functional!  It is so nice to be in a meeting with my partners or accountant or client and be able to look up data on my iPhone. SO worth it... I love it!!!!!!!
Clunky and awkward. App can be awkward to navigate.
Total scam. I do not have the ability to open this app but somehow you have been able to continue to bill my credit card monthly. I cancelled a credit card because you have no contact info. Sites to cancel service by. Somehow you have gotten ahold of my new cc info!!! Cancel this service now!!!!
Quick overlook. I've been using desktop and online versions of Quickbooks for decades. This online app is a great addition. It allows me to quickly update our bank accounts and keep on top of things while traveling.
Sweet business app. Fantastic app for running my business when in remote areas or on the go!! No glitches with the app either!
Great App for business.. A ++ Must have app
"Not worth money and it's free!. When it works it's ok at best but it's too flawed to take seriously. 
Among its faults:
Failing to find entries on search even when the search term is correct. 

Doing things like stating the ""delivery server is down"" when trying to email an invoice. The ""delivery server"" is not down as the user finds out when they continue to send other invoices. 

Upon investigation of the fault it issues brainless messages such as ""You (name) and You (same name) we're working on the document at the same time and you (name) finished before you (same name) did. 

You get the point!

App search not formatted with an iPad so the iPad user cannot see all of the information being searched for (when search works at all)

Seems to randomly wish to send verification text codes even though it claims that it should only happen once.

Updates do not address the faults just add a fluffy new feature. 

Seems the app was slung together and no one researches how it might be used.

In use there are constant error messages (like for every step) saying you don't have permission to add s part and then it lets you do it. Imagine going to your customer for a signature and they see these messages. 

App is constantly updated giving the user features they don't need but they never update to fix the bugs!"
Best financial app for non-finance people. The most user friendly, cutting edge, accessible and collaborative financial app you can find which is affordable and does the job with least amount of financial knowledge.
TouchID times out. Unfortunately the TouchID authentication doesn't work as you'd expect. The app constantly asks for you to enter a password even with it enabled.
Getting better. I can't live without this app. Is not perfect but getting better. Thank you for the improvements.
MGRM. Great app
Quick and easy. Had a few teething issues getting used to the system, but I fund it easier to work and the app makes it easy to take shots of receipts to add electronic records
App crashes. This app crashes or cannot save my data on every entry I make.  Horrible app!!
Great on the go. I absolutely love using this app, lets take my office on the road!
"QBO app. Luv the new dashboard!!
Excellent app. No complaints."
Great app. Would be lost without it, saves me a fortune in accountants fees
QuickBooks mobile app. I love the flexibility this app offers. It's a huge step and my personal goal to become paperless while giving me the ability to bill on site.
Really helpful!!. I am a computer engineer and being able to make estimates and invoices in the field has really helped me!
"Super user-friendly. I love this app, as it is very easy to use even if you aren't completely accounting savvy. I would like to be able to setup ""reminder"" emails to clients who have PAST DUE invoices. Other than that, I'm very happy with the features of this app."
Quick Books app. Good to connect and keep up with the business!
Working great, love dashboard. App is easy to use on the go. Some things are better done on desktop but for the most part can do a invoice from phone and accept payments.
Amazing Apps！. So amazing！
"Just like the web version. The new updates are great.

It's just like the web version minus tax lodgements which is possibly due to regional differences.

The only gripe I have is the lack of keyboard integration which means you will need to use the touch screen but it's an ipad app so can't really complain there."
Simply works. It does the job. Would like to give 5 stars but unfortunately the app still doesn't allow me to work with multiple currencies.
Reduced feature set. Need to have timesheet function put into app!
"Give us usable features!. Give US time tracking! I've been requesting this for 3 years now but I have Yelp connections! Yay who cares!  People who are working to make a living, need real functionality not stupid stuff like Yelp. This makes no sense!

I want to add my time after getting done working at a client but I can't.  The point is to help YOUR CUSTOMERS WORK and MAKE MONEY!  But you release stupid features.   The whole reason I went to Online was to be able to access it anywhere and if I have my non 3G laptop, I can but I got an iPad with LTE so I can put my time in but I can't do that!  Please give us usable features in the iPhone and iPad apps!    Basically QB online is only good if you have a computer, not a tablet of any type. 

This app is good for entering in my received checks and that's about all.  Thanks for caring about your customers Intuit."
Doesn't work for ipad. This app doesn't even load my company info. It keeps returning error trying to load company info. I have contacted quickbooks a number of times and all they say is they are working on the issue and to use a web browser version in the mean time. I have seen about 4 updates released and not one of them has fixed this issue. When will this be fixed?
Missing some elements, overall good. I like this app. Great to be able to give client receipt right away. Wish we could do deposits and reconciliations!
Great as an assistant to the desktop version.. I've found this app to be a great mobile partner to the full desktop (or online) version. There's a couple functions that aren't available in the app but everything you DO need is easily available. I can't connect my bank account because my (non US) bank isn't listed but being able to input expenses as they happen is a great way of keeping updated accounts. Reconciliation is a breeze afterwards. It's a great app.
Date range. How do I change the date range on the dashboard?
Limited. For alot of the functionality of QBO you need to use the web app anyway so I would not bother with this app.
Crashes. Every time I try signing in the app says my sign in has expired.
Time saver!!!. I have been using it online, now with the app it goes by so much faster!!
Awesome!. So easy to categorize expenses and view financial statements in seconds!
CPO. Love, love, love QB app! I can create invoices & sales receipts on the go & easily - even process credit card payments.
App. Best app
Great App and fair prices. I do all my business through quick books and have had no major problems. The rates on credit transactions are equivalent to any other clearing house and at $30 a month to automate my process is a life saver. Great simple to read reports too.
Great software. This does everything I absolutely need it to do. I wouldn't use anything else it's easy to manage they have great customer service and I don't have any complaints about it keep up the great work thanks for making my job a lot easier.
Love it.. I love this app. Easy to use and is pretty reliable within little downtime. However I would like more options like inclusion of SKU numbers and the ability to pay for subscriptions within the app.
"Immediate Session Time Out. Immediately logs me out due to ""Session Time Out"", rendering the app completely useless. 😒"
Mobile app. Convenient.
App ruined. This is getting old. The app seems to be unusable every time an update heads out way. My invoices are showing old data, are not updating to show payments and do not match what is correctly shown in the real online desktop service. Please fix , and stop updating prior to testing
Love It. Love the app, really intuitive!!! And great customer service!!!
Lacks useful features. Where are the reports and why aren't bank feeds integrated? How can they claim this app keeps you up to date with your business!!! It's far too dumbed down. You cant even reconcile payments. The P&L image they use to advertise the app isnt available in the actual app!! Angry!
Best Accounting Software I've tried. This has got to be the most intuitive feature rich reasonably priced cloud computing package for small business I've ever seen. Waaay better than MYOB, such a great little app.
Convenient app for my accounting on the go. Love the user friendly interface and convenience of upkeeping my accounts anytime anywhere
Makes life easy. Great app that makes accounting on the fly so simple.
Great App...! (Sabre Rx). Great App, really works well now that the New Syc App with Square has been released.
Fairly useless. This app is difficult to navigate. It doesn't come close to mimicking QBO for PCs. The functionality is very limited. It's ok for looking up some things but difficult to update info such as logging checks or deposits.
Suits me. People accustomed to the full desktop version seem to have a hard time adapting.  But for me, a first time small-business owner, it's great.  I can create a receipt after an appointment on my phone or ipad, then go home later & receive a payment for the same invoice on my laptop or desktop.  Sync to my bank...no problem.  And customer service is usually pretty good. My comptroller likes being able to look at what I'm doing while we are on the phone.  I'm a fan.  It works for me
This app having more issues reload if you have an issue.. Invoice not showing up. I don't think it is syncing correctly with Quickbooks online that is going to be an issue when I loose money and or re invoice my customer.   :( please fix this.  Note reloading app cause it to fix these issue.  Intuit needs a reload company button.
Easy and convenient. As a first time user, both app and desk top versions of Quick is easy to use. Moreover, the app makes my life much easier.  Even when I'm out of the office, invoicing, paying, receiving, and quick views of current status can be done at the fingertips.
Great App. I don't have any problems with the app, seamless integration with the desktop.
Excellent app and service.. Great product.
Great App. This app / software really saves my life.
Works for me!. I love this this QuickBooks app can cross platforms. Every entry is accounted for in a matter which device I use (and I have a ton). As with anything, there are glitches but they do not stop production. Like everything can't be perfect all the time and with the constant improvement, bugs are expected here and there.
Great App!. This app has saved me tons of time and I love it!
Simply terrific. Hands down best invoicing app
Great app for busy employers/employees. Your features are reduced and it's not the exact same as when you use a pc but it is still really nice. I would not be want it to be as in depth anyways it's nice and simple. I would recommend it to anybody that needs QuickBooks on the go. We do a lot of work in the field and it is really nice to do estimates and email them to the customer while standing right next to them.
GARY STANTON. This app means I can seem to know what I am doing, it actually works for me.
Some good features but limited and pricey.. Search features are extremely limited. Find an invoice using customer PO number? Can't. Essentially, to find something you have to already know where it is. Data differs from desktop version sometimes. Only 2 generic reports available in mobile app. Disappointing functionality considering the QB Online monthly fees!
It seems they don't want you to actually use it. The last two updates have killed the apps usefulness. The current version tells you your session has expired as soon as you log in. No amount of uninstalling and reinstalling of the app fixes the problem. The previous version forced a full log in every time the app was opened. C'mon QuickBooks. I'm trying to run a business, not spend my time trying to work the software. It looks like it's time to explore for a better, more reliable, option.
JUNK UPDATE = WORTHLESS APP. Since the latest update, my QB app shows an error saying that my session has expired immediately after I log in. I can't use it at all. PC access is okay.
Great stuff. For me, this app is perfect. As a freelance travel writer I can take a snap shot of my expenses and update my accounts on the road. The only problem I have is that you cannot access the app when you have no coverage so I cannot work offline.
When it works. I rely heavily on the Quickbooks mobile app. When it works, it works great. But every once in a while, it goes down, for days.
Session expired loop. Every time I log in I get a session expired message and logs me out. App is not usable.
Great App!. Really handy to be able to use my phone to raise invoices or make them as paid when I check my internet banking on my phone too.
Awful.  Doesn't work.. Logs me out instantly every time I sign in... wish I could evaluate more.  Love the online version, but this app is struggling.
Terrible app...... Terrible app it does not work. Since last update👿
Why the love. App just doenst work well - slow and just not a great experience.
PDF NOTE ON IPAD. Why can't we add a PDF note on iPad app. I can do it by accessing desktop version on ipad. But it's a pain doing it that way. The writing in the download box. The iPad wants to copy that. Instead of accessing icloud or other cloud options. It takes several trys to do it that way. It would be simpler to add that option to the app. Come on guys keep up with the technology. Quit lagging behind.
"Highly recommended!!. As a self employed tradesman, I was finding myself spending countless hours quoting & invoicing! This app has made running my business much smoother and given me free time on evenings (which is rare).

Admittedly it was pretty tricky to setup but the support helpline (both telephone & email) were fantastic at helping out.

Already recommended to other friends in the trade 👍"
Awesome app!. Great software, well written and updated regularly, moves seamlessly between phone iPad and desktop
"Does not work like before. Since the recent update the mobile app is useless for me.

If I receive a payment and post it the app will not reflect a payment posted, desktop version shows the payment received. So if I try to post the payment then I get an unapplied payment. In other words I'm entering it twice. 
Another thing, it does not allow me to see at glance if an invoice was sent (sent) now I have to go in to each invoice and see if there is a check mark, even if I've emailed the invoice and I still don't get a check mark, this is very confusing and the app is certainly not as functional as before. Please fix."
Needs purchase orders. Work in the construction industry and the biggest nightmare is a PO system. You can create them online but this app does not allow for PO generation which is a huge draw back. If this could be added in it would be a 5 star but till that get added it's very limiting.
"DO NOT UPGRADE TO LATEST SOFTWARE!!. I have used this app for almost a year and it has worked VERY WELL for my small business. 

Likes:
-Stores client info
- allows for CC payment 
- allows me to include my company logo and information on each invoice.
- alerts me of tardy invoices
- provides me with easy to read charts and measure each months income/expenses

Dislikes:

- credit card payments incur a hefty fee rather than a flat monthly charge.
- My invoices have an InTuit logo which is annoying.
- Customer service is hurting. Wish they had a 1800 # or immediate online chat support like so many other software companies."
"Great App. Been with Quickbooks for two years now and still really impressed 
Very easy to use and works across all platforms
Would strongly recommend"
I love this app. This is the easiest to use and simplest way to use it.
User. Good app but needs more features
"Not worth money and it's free!. When it works it's ok at best but it's too flawed to take seriously. 
Among its faults:
Failing to find entries on search even when the search term is correct. 

Doing things like stating the ""delivery server is down"" when trying to email an invoice. The ""delivery server"" is not down as the user finds out when they continue to send other invoices. 

Upon investigation of the fault it issues brainless messages such as ""You (name) and You (same name) we're working on the document at the same time and you (name) finished before you (same name) did. 

You get the point!

App search not formatted with an iPad so the iPad user cannot see all of the information being searched for (when search works at all)

Seems to randomly wish to send verification text codes even though it claims that it should only happen once.

Updates do not address the faults just add a fluffy new feature. 

Seems the app was slung together and no one researches how it might be used."
Working great. App is easy to use on the go. Some things are better done on desktop but for the most part can do a invoice from phone and accept payments.
It's glitchy!. Although it fulfills the need of having the ability to create estimates on the spot and re-send invoices quickly, it has glitches which are frustrating. On occasion it stalls and goes out of the app requiring you to log on several times and even restart your phone before be able to access the app.
So far so good.... The app does what I need it to do mostly. One of the coolest things is being able to photograph my biz receipts into the app, and throw away the original. I'm not crazy about the app in terms of creating invoices that do not match what my desktop version looks like. Hopefully the fix for that comes soon. 4 stars from our end.
"Yay...it's working again!!. QBs has been quite efficient and easy to use! I appreciate like the constant improvements!! However, note to developer...I wish this app gave ""real time"" reminds/notices of when to bill a client based on days, just to make it more customized???!? Maybe add a calendar with an to synchronize with the personal/IPad calendars??? I down know, I just find myself calculating day for my customized client each time, instead of just getting a notification. Thank, still love this app!!!"
"Another worthless Intuit Product. Good for customer data base. Good for invoicing and receiving payments. Fair at tracking expenses. Near useless as an accurate or bookkeeping tool when linked to
a bank account. So many obscure and  poorly explained manual actions required that error is easy to introduce and tech support usually makes things worse. One may as well use good old
fashioned paper ledgers and a calculator.
Cost me 400 bucks for CPA to straighten out the mess. I feel Intuit owes me money. I should sue them for fraud."
Awesome!!. The best app ever created!
Very user easy. This app is great. Very user friendly!
"Superb!!!. This is a great app for keeping up to date with accounts.
Links to my bank accounts and intelligently matches transactions and remembers previous matches and entries.
Certainly deserves the name QuickBooks based on how quickly I can enter my bank transactions.
Great for multi-user access and very easy to set up.
Overall this is much better than I expected."
Yes! It crashed. Sept. 26 it crashed. Customer service new nothing about it the 29th. I have a 5. Are you forcing me to upgrade?
Horrible. Crashes every time. Horrible customer service.  Move on to another app.
Unreliable. Downloaded this because I was looking for something a little more functional than my current invoice app. Had for about a week and now the app won't even open, very disappointed because I was really starting to like the software. Thankfully I was still using the free trial and hadn't purchased it for the month or year like I had planned on doing.
Update = Crash. Haven't been able to use app since updated. Disrupting my business. Will not open.
Crashes. Upgraded to iOS 10, now app will no open.
Great app and the best accountancy system so far.. I've tested many different products from competitors and Quick Books is the best so far. I've used online version first and then downloaded mac app which is quite fast to use. Mobile app works seamlessly with both and its great business tool. I don't really understand other negative reviews and people having issues with software. Please make sure you're using latest updated version of the app and your iOS. Thanks Matt
App doesn't work. Since updating this a couple of days ago, can't open the App at all. Please sort!
The app used to work?. Why do companies change apps from functional to crash is beyond me?
App is Pants. The app was working perfectly until ios10! Now opens for .5 second and crashs! How do I run my business accounts on the go!!!! Fix needed today!!!
App does not open. After the latest update, the app does not open. It has been a real inconvenience.
Great app. Great app
"Back to 5 stars ! After App Crashed on IOS 9 and IOS 10. After upgrading to latest version this morning the app crash has now gone.
Back to five stars for an awesome product. 

Well done for listening to the reviewers comments. 
This is a great product !!!! - but seems to be let down by your app support model!

Well done on the bug fixes - a little late but at least you have stopped me wasting time by wiping my phone for no reason!"
Crashes on launch. Latest OS installed, the app crashes when I try to open it. Hope a fix comes soon!
Current update just crashes. ios10 with the new update on iPad don't work.  App opens then immediately closes.
Update Issues. I have used this app for years with no operating issues. Unfortunately the last two updates have disrupted my business flow. Now I can't even open the app. Hopefully with the recent price increase intuit will have the resources to figure this out. My rating is based on recent update experiences.
Fix the app!!!. This app use to work great until the last update! Please fix ASAP!
Update crashed. I have all of my quickbooks point of sale iPads that cannot open the app since the update! We have all had to resort to computers and phones to run our business! You may want to consider this before you join up with QuickBooks! They are notorious for problems relating to their QuickBooks online.
App crash when opening. Can not open app on my iPad version running on 9.3.5. This is Last week of month and can not open app to print Invoice for end of month. Huge problem for me.please fix asap
App crashes. Ever since update cannot open app. Need to fix immediately.
Great app. Saved me hours of paperwork, great app 👍
I'd complain about crashing. But it won't even open. I used this app every single day for years, now its trash?! Get it working please. I have paperwork that needs to get done.
Won't open. I use this app daily and now it won't open! Please fix this!
Open & Closes. What's going on. The app just open and closes on my iPad. I can access is on my iPhone, but the iPad version is not accessible.
Broken app. Latest update broke it. App will no longer launch and immediately crashes. Now looking at alternatives.
Quickbooks Saves Me Time & Money. This app has streamlined my business as I am always on the go. Its easy, efficient and powerful!
Kerry Pabian. Are you kidding me !!! App is crashing on my iPad since the update ! Why do you always do updates right before its time to do billing ?
App will not open after update. App will not open on my iPhone, making it impossible to input expenses and worse still accept payment on jobs!
Crashes on open. Useful app until this update. It crashes on open, both on iPad and iPhone.  Cannot do business this way...
App Crashes on IOS 9 and IOS 10. When I click on support it takes you to a web page that also does not work properly. Do you have email support ?
Awful app, won't open. App was working fine until a few days ago. Reinstalling doesn't fix it. App opens and a second later disappears. Not good for people trying to do their accounts.
App won't open after latest update! Please fix ASAP!. App won't open after latest update! Please fix ASAP!
"App Crashes in iOS9. This app was working great before the recent update.
App just crashes when I try to open.
I use an iPad 3rd gen running the latest version of iOS9.
Please fix!!"
app. can not open quickbook app even after update.
Stopping Subscription. Originally a useful app, but keeps crashing following the most recent update on 27.09. Will have to stop subscription and find something that works, so whats the point in updating the app if you lose customers?
Crash. Latest update causes app to crash on loading.
"Missing a couple things. Would be even better if the mobile app allowed you to enter the ""ship time"" and ""ship date"" and if the ""reports"" could be viewed on the app- could be more full service"
Great flexibility. Love being able to do estimates and invoices on the go.
Opens the closes. After the last update of quick books I can not access it on my iPad. There for it is costing me money. I hit the app it opens the closes right back. I have uninstalled it and reinstalled it and it is the same thing. I have 3 jobs I did today that I could not take payment on because of this. Please fix asap
Crash instantly on iPhone 5. This app crashes instantly and doesn't operate on my iPhone 5 running the latest iPhone software. I tried removing and reinstalling but it still doesn't work. Why don't you guys fix this?
Amazing that I can make invoices and take payments literally anywhere with cell service.. I think it's an amazing app. The only downfall is I can't add invoices from vendors that I haven't paid yet. Only expenses that are already paid.  Hence the 4 stars. If they had that feature it would be a five star for sure.
"QuickBooks App is a perfect companion to QuickBooks online. QuickBooks App is a perfect companion to QuickBooks online. It works seamlessly allowing you to read through your transactions and even create most of the common tasks. ( with the exception of VAT tasks)
QB online is the perfect accounts program"
New update fail to open. Just updated and app will not open
Disappointed. Downloaded this app so I could buy the payroll feature for my new company but it crashes immediately upon opening.
"Weak on the Vendor side. Okey app but needs major overhaul improvements.
1) you can't even attach  any document (except photos.  Who uses photo docs these days anyways?) to your invoice while you are on the go
2-Easy to upgrade your your version and IMPOSSIBLE TO DOWNGRADE.
3)-Very weak on the billing and statement for vendors ( example when Recording an expense, this app does not have the capability of recording the item count you spending For example ( 50 gallons of diesel * $3.25  = total) this app can't do this.
Very weak on the billing and statement for vendors
That's why I gave 1 stars otherwise it would get 5*.
I think the time to look for an other home (I mean accounting software) has come.   Please share possible altanitives.  Thanks"
Time saver. I highly recommend this app, specially for small business. Quick, easy and in combination with Service M8 it's all I need.
"Rubbish. ""Run your entire business"" - what a joke. This app is pretty useless to do anything. QuickBooks is already hard to use and this just doesn't help."
"Love this App!. Very easy and simple to use. I can instantly add details from job to job and also great for keeping track of what's going on in my company. Thanks 

JDM Auto Detailing"
Best App to fallow my customers!. QB online + QB App is the best!
Messrs. Great app, makes life for an accountant easy
Great app. Works well
Good app. Very useful app when on the go.
Great app. I am enjoying staying on top of things while on the go.
"Easy to use, powerful, brilliant. Managing everything on the run is important... With Quickbooks I can do pretty much everything I need from my mobile saving me valuable time!

Only thing I would request is an Apple Watch app."
Crashes often. This app goes from being usable to worthless on a whim.
Love it!. So far the app is easy to navigate and I like using it.
I'm underutilizing this app!!. This app is WAY more capable than the extant than I'm using it for! The best version of the app is on the iPad. The worst version is on my MBP.
Stupid app. And never works right nightmare to login
Love this app!. Easy to use on the go!
"Solid App with pros and cons. Let me start by writing that I'm a finance major by education and I've been a QB desktop user for well over a decade, so I'd consider myself a QB expert user. Then I was exposed to QB online (the Plus version) through some work I do with a non-profit.

If you're coming to QB online, from QB desktop, there's going to be a bit of a culture shock. I say that because, as an advanced user I find that the online version is lacking a number of features that I am used to in the desktop version. Also, there are a number of hidden features that are not available to general users, but you really won't know that until you call tech-support... which is, I have to admit, really quite good.

Because you're dealing with a remote database you're going to find that there is a lag time as QB writes and retrieves data. This becomes a painful realization if you are entering a large number of transactions, or trying to clean up someone else's nightmare idea of bookkeeping. 

As a sidenote, I read in another review that someone complained about data not being in sync across multiple platforms. I found this as well on a couple of occasions, however, in my situation this was resolved by closing the app and reopening it. I have also had to reboot the app (on every platform) for various other reasons, a remedy that is more than slightly annoying when I am trying to get large quantities of work done.  All of these ills, in my opinion, are attributable to the fact that you're dealing with the remote database, and something gets hung up in communication. 

Those criticisms aside, QB online does have a lot of great things going for it. It's extremely portable, and does have many of the rudimentary features found in QB desktop. I've been able to look at financial data, send invoices, make vendor payments, as well a whole host of other tasks right from my iPad. 

Overall I have to give QB online a thumbs up. Yes there's still work to be done, but it's a solid app, and Intuit is moving in the right direction with this product."
"Design and Functionality is Poor. The pin code doesn't work.  I have to refresh data most of the time. Crashes a few times a week. 

Trying to edit description or client info is a pain.

Here is another update ok the app. 

It says clients have paid invoice on my phone when they haven't   app is frustrating to work with."
Great software. Very happy I use to use a different software but it wasn't as good as QuickBooks thank you QuickBooks
Amazing!. This app undoubtedly helps running multiple businesses on the road possible! When I finally switched my businesses from desktop to online there were a few things missing. I wrote a few complaints and spoke with their development team...few short months later...boom! Additions were made! One if which is being able to switch businesses within the app. Definitely much easier than logging in and out all the time.
Worst app ever ! Not reliable. Been using qb for may years, the last few years have been tough for them. We use our Mobile app constantly, but it has many issues. It constantly crashes and some day it just won't open. Not acceptable. We have taken to customers service many times, but the problems still persist. I get it growing pains  right ? Is just too much. We are looking for an alternative software like cero.  Sad but qb get 1 star .
Seems good so far!. I just downloaded the app, however for what I use QB for, this app is perfect and will definitely make my time more efficient. I am always on the go and hand-write all checks. From what I can see, you can quickly enter checks written (and even take a picture) and also manage your online banking. Which is perfect for my needs.
Very easy to use. This app is extremely easy to use and very helpful.
"THE BEST APP OUT THERE BY FAR. The App is excellent for anyone on the go. Easy to upload info from the app. User friendly. Tried a few other book keeping apps and found this to be the best by far. Gets even better 
every download. 1 issue(for me) is that I can't attach a pdf  to invoices using a device. Would be 5⭐️ if the next update includes this."
Quickbooks. This app is excellent and the version on my computer is even better save's me hours when quoting well worth the money.
Great app. Easy accounting program to implement and run with. Great to have access across all my devices.
Great app. Quick books has come a long way this app it's great love it
Excellent. Really good app. Carry your whole business in your pocket.
"Better than Xero. Brilliant app. 
Seamless to use.
All of my clients now use it!"
Great App!. I was using Quickbooks Pro desktop 2013 before going to online 2016.  All I can say is Wow!  I never realized how much I was missing.  Reconciling expenses with automatic bank and credit card transaction downloads can be done on my phone anywhere and anytime.  No need to log into bank and manually download.   Huge time saver.  Also keeps me up to date on my finances with great reporting built in and at my fingertips.
Needs additional function. This is a great app for limited situations. It needs support for bills, deposits, and bill payments.
Good but needs improvements. Great app for small businesses, but should have a feature to customize invoice with a job location on the header not in a small custom field box, Also would like to see a disclaimer format to add with invoice
Muy útil. La app es excelente, súper útil!! Pero estoy pensando en dejar de usarla por que es demasiado costosa.
"QB app. Product has improved greatly since its first launch.

Still room for improvement. 

I wish you could add time activities like you can in the online version."
Great app. I haven't subscribe fully but am definitely paying for this...
Great program. I love quickbooks.  I run payroll and create estimates, invoices and sales receipts.  I am able to link all my accounts even my square account easily and seamlessly.  The customer service representatives are competent and friendly.
Awesome!. Great app, easy to use.
"Superbe app!. QBook me facilite la tâche (pour ma part, la comptabilité est un fardeau) dans le fait de garder un œil sur les chiffres de mon entreprise .
Allez-y!"
Excellent app. Keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
"Outstanding app!. Owning a small business has enough headaches as it is. With quickbooks, estimating and invoicing projects and services couldn't be easier! Everything is streamline! 

 Here's a look inside my day to day as a landscaper using quickbooks: 

Initial client meeting-> estimate delivered before I leave the property.. BAM! 

 They call back that night or the next day and we have the job.

 After we finish the project, turn that estimate into an invoice on site.. BAM! PAID! $$ in the bank!"
Crashes. The app just crashes as soon as it starts to load.  Don't waste your time downloading it.
So simple and quick to use. I have downloaded the app and have been using it for my self employed hairdressing. It is so easy to use and because I use my phone often it's great to pick it up at the end of the day and track my takings in which means I never have to worry about not being up to date. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants an easy and simple way to keep detailed accounts!
"Very Nice!. I love have this power in my phone! I can email invoices or print them out, ALL on my phone! 
This app is Easy to learn and soooooo fast when you get used to it. There was A Lot of thinking when they designed this app, WOW"
Great App. This app makes keeping up with everything so simple!
Not working. App will not open on iPhone 6 Plus
"My customers love this. I'm a piano teacher, and for years, I've been inconsistent with giving receipts to families. Now, I can bill them and give them professional quality receipts easily.

One thing I must say here: I don't try to keep my bank account records through this app, so I am not qualified to comment on that."
Invoices on the Go with ease!. It is said that the measure of success is doing your job well and with ease. I work several different jobs, one job is office manager for a local repair shop. I no longer have to wait for the boss to physically come in to the shop to review invoices. We can also do invoices while on the job site which helps get us paid faster. Communication between my boss and my self is much improved since we can see exactly what the other is doing. This app has allowed me to do my job well and with ease. Thank You! One feature I would like to add is to flag invoices and label the invoices as printed / mailed. Currently, I have to go back through the activity log or write a note to accomplish this. Again, thanks.
Much room for improvement. Lack of a solid search function along with slow load times make this an app that leaves a lot to be desired. Even the online functionality can use improvement. Still a decent system for a small business but hopefully they'll spend some time fixing the app soon.
"Another weak quickbooks mobile app. Once again, with excitement I upgrade only to be letdown. When will intuit make a full function app? I love the message that tells me the function isn't't available for my device but I can access it from my p/c...Great, I'm still tied to my desk! Why bother with the mobile app then??
I love how I can only rate this useless app once in the lifetime of having it,I would give it no stars if I could!"
Very unstable!. Downloaded the new version but the app consistently crashes just after login. Real shoddy development and testing by Intuit.
iPad Pro fault. The app keeps crashing on the iPad Pro not a happy customer !
Great app for small business. Simple easy to set up and use on the road.
Crashing and finger id. This app keeps crashing and the fingerprint ID still doesn't work, apart from that it's good!
Changed our Business. From the first version of this App with the online version of Quickbooks, this has changed our business. No more scribbled notes on sticky paper or back of a student roster. Sales are done immediately and nothing is lost or forgotten. My only request is to please add time tracking fit our instructors into the App, then it would be perfect!
Very Easy To Use. The app works flawless. Being able to sign in with biometrics, take photo of receipts and capture expenses quickly is one of the many great feature.
Master Electrician. This app has done everything that I have asked of it.  Fantastic of estimating, invoicing and receiving payments in the field while on the job site.  Really saves me time.
Great app and super easy to use. Very easy to use and customise. Very intuitive to use and no excuse not to update on the go
Great app. Thanks for the update. Touch ID works now and I'm not getting asked for my password all the time. Would like to be able to enter my time though!
Perfect App for Any Small Business Owner. As a QBO Pro Advisor my opinion may be somewhat biased but I can not brag enough about the software, customer support and resources offered by QuickBooks/Intuit.  QBO has allowed me to become a completely virtual bookkeeping firm, increasing my service area, customer satisfaction and turn around time. Love love love them!!
"Quick books online. Good for customer data base. Good for invoicing and receiving payments. Fair at tracking expenses. Near useless as an accurate or bookkeeping tool when linked to
a bank account. So many obscure and  poorly explained manual actions required that error is easy to introduce and tech support usually makes things worse. One may as use good old
fashioned paper ledgers and a calculator.
Don't trust it with your numbers!"
Great convenient tool in my pocket. Easy tool that makes managing my business easy. I love that I can track expenses and receipts by syncing my banks count and snapping pictures with my cell phone. Super convenient features that recognize future transactions and automatically categorizes them. The only downfall thus far, is that it keeps crashing! Please fix it so it can be five stars instead of 4.
Needs more features. I recently got an iPad.  I really would love to use this app instead of having to go to the website through safari (which is horrible on the iPad).  However, without custom reports, this app is VERY limited.
Awesome app!. This is a smooth and seamless app that allows me to access all of my company needs wherever I am. Invoicing in particular is easy, efficient, and professional!
Great App. This app / software really saves my life.
Won't open. This app won't open.  Don't waste your time.
Awsome software. That is a great app but still far away from the desktop program .... Limited access for a lot futures it's ok but not wow for the yearly cost
Touch ID Doesn't Work. Touch ID still doesn't work. I just downloaded the most recent upgrade and Touch ID still doesn't work. I'm still required to enter my password each time I open the app. Please fix. Otherwise, I really like this app.
Wish I could charge cards on file. Love the app, just wish I could input new customer's card information and charge the existing customer's cards on file when accepting payments so I could do my accounting from anywhere.
Great app. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😊😊
The latest version keeps crashing. Open the app and it crashes. Try to enter a payment and it just keeps processing, not finalizing the command. I've tried it 10 times. I've closed out the app to re-load, powered on and off my iPhone, and nothing is working. Please fix!
Its great. Does not have all the fetures like when you log in on a computer exp to make deposits a register. It works but now a days we all dont have computers any more. Most people need software version for tablets ex ipad etc. other then some items needed in the next few updates it works great.
"Frustrating. The number one use for this app should be to keep track of activity on the go so you don't play catch up at the office. For me, not being able to bill my clients for expenses through the mobile platform renders this app basically useless. I still have to remember to log in and find the expenses of the day and mark them as ""billable expenses"" when I return to my computer?!?"
Mobile App. Not happy. I am on the phone with support everyday. Won't print on app or on chrome. They don't know what to do. This mobile is worthless to me. I don't have time for this!
"Dissapointed. Really let down by this app. I can't access my transactions on my Amex through their app. The solution? Open it through a mobile web browser. That's not why I got this program!! 

And just my personal opinion, I feel like the UI is a little weird. Not enough options to organize things your way, or to be able to see transactions right away...you have to go through many windows. Also, invoice is a little weird. Not enough space to customize and put additional information in like the older non-web based program. 

Overall, it's trying to hard to cater to too many different audiences and with too many restrictions."
Ok App. Easy to setup. Big difference between windows version and iPad version. Like the amount of critical info showed.  On the windows version all critical info is shown. On the iSO device not enough info shown. Like cash sale,
"QB app !!!. Love the app !
Now with the new update I can log in with Touch ID :))) 
How fan, and saving much time."
Awful. iPhone app pretty much unusable in the real world.  Always wants to be signed in each time you open it, Touch ID feature doesn't work.  Today it's complaining the app needs to be updated before I use it, it then directs me to the App Store where it shows I already have the latest version!
Quick Books App. This app is really good, can do nearly everything I need from the phone.
Business owner. Qb app is so hard to use and is different on every device. If you lose connection while creating an estimate/invoice etc. you will lose all info imputed and have to re-enter everything again
Dissappointed to say the least.... I've been a customer of quickcrooks since 2008 and I cant say that there has been one stress free day with working with this application, across all platforms...  The one thing that really got me to write this review is the fact that I paid $60 for two EMV chip card readers so that I can accept credit cards once again without being totally responsible for fraudulent charges.  The kicker, you cant use the reader with quickbooks online. and now if you use your magentic reader you are charged a higher fee... NOT SURPRISED.... So not only is there no way to take payment  from my invoicing computer via the card swipe but now I cant even take a payment with the EMV card readers I HAD TO BUY.  Un real.  The app is garbage with issues everywhere.  There is no need for me to remind you because I'm sure you've seen the thousands of other disgruntled customers. TOUCH ID....  If you are going to put a product out I recommend making something of quality and doing a ton of testing before it goes out on the market.
Great starter app. I wouldn't want to use this app all the time as is is a little annoying.  Does what it says on the tin, great as a starter accountancy tool.
Saves so much time. I got this app to help save time and it does. It took awhile to set up and I have had to phone for help a few times and they have been fab. I can send invoices and receipts form my phone. I am able to keep up to date on my accounts without the effort.
General consensus. Customer support for mobile app is horrible. The mobile app really needs some help. They should travel along with mobile users to see issues and frustrations that arise in the field. I am a professional but at times this app makes me look very unprofessional. The should work on offline features.
"Limited functionality. When using an iPad Pro 12.9, one should be able to use the full web interface, but probably because the ""client"" being interpreted incorrectly on the ""server"" end, the web interface doesn't work as well as it should. If there were full functionality in the app, one wouldn't have a need for the full web interface, but because the functionality is so limited in the app, one needs the full web interface. Conclusion: Either provide full functionality in the app or fix the way the web interface works with an iPad Pro 12.9."
Great app. Fantastic app. Does everything I need to run my business on the go.
Great App!. I was using Quickbooks Pro desktop 2013 before going to online 2016.  All I can say is Wow!  I never realized how much I was missing.  Reconciling expenses with automatic bank and credit card transaction downloads can be done on my phone anywhere and anytime.  No need to log into bank and manually download.   Huge time saver.  Also keeps me up to date on my finances with great reporting built in and at my fingertips.
Dig it!. I mainly use the app for looking at financials, but the invoicing, reporting, and such is great too.
Thumbs up for the business help!!!. Take the time to go through the tutorials and this is an amazing app to help with any small business!!!
Missing some elements, overall good. I like this app. Great to be able to give client receipt right away. Wish we could do deposits and reconciliations!
"App good but needs better features. The application is fairly reliable.  There are many features such as ""shipping date"" and special fields not accessible from iOS devices which make the app less useful than it should be.  Also, since the new chip credit card reader came out, it is still incompatible for payments in Quickbooks.  Good but should be better.  It is a great product for real time customer service but has a way to go before being excellent."
QBO. Quick Books Online is a great app. The ability to have access to business data at all times is not only critical but essential for any business.
Love it. This app helps me keep my business organized on the go
Great to use on the go!. Love this app. I use it alongside the website, this is on my phone. It's not as easy to navigate around as the website but it's not intended to use totally on its own. I love being able to send invoices whilst doing other things - really helps me to consolidate my time.
Not pleased. For one I still can't re-download the app after I accidentally deleted it.  It's been months.  I hit the cloud button and it does nothing. I also put an estimate in and the phone didn't save it.   When I checked desktop it was saved 6x because I kept trying to do it on the phone. The app has many glitches but it is helpful when I'm not by a computer but u cannot rely solely on the app.
They screwed up logging in with pin. I used to have to type my full password in only every few days. Now it's several times a day. Why even have the option to use a pin if it only works a couple times. I contacted them through the app but got no response.
Great App. Being able to use Quickbooks on my phone has really helped my business run more efficiently. I'm able to manage customers and employees all from my phone.
"Pros and Cons. It definitely takes some getting used to compared to the previous versions of Quickbooks I've used.

But with some changes to what I'm used to and working with the software and its workflow it works out.

The payments thing makes sending and receiving invoices works really well.  Adding expenses by taking pictures of the receipts keeps my clutter box of receipts free.

Still needs some improvement but my overall experience hasn't been bad."
Major improvements. In recent months there have been great updates that have made the app very functional inbetween times I'm not at a pc.  You can't expect it to run the same as on your pc.
Like. Loving the app!! Thank you!!
sales tax calculation is wrong. when creating an invoice, the app does not honor customer's sales tax setting. it applies tax even on customers with tax turned off. please fix asap!!!!
"No offline mode. The main reason that this app will not work for me in every case is that you have to sign in every time and that means having good cell signal. 

I was frustrated recently when I was doing service work for a customer and I had no cell service at their house.  

I needed to access previous records and because I couldn't Open the app without signing in and that requires Internet, The whole situation left me quite embarrassed and feeling very unprofessional. 

Maybe I should just use my phones native note taking apps to keep records that way and then just use QuickBooks on my desk top only. 

What's the point of a mobile app when you cannot access it. 

Not everyone has ideal soul service 24 hours a day. 

I have other apps that I use for different various reasons and it has a sync feature. This allows you to access the app, enter information, access information and it will sync up when you get into cell service or Wi-Fi later on. 

I thought this would be the standard. 

If you're worried about security just have an app that has a lock code on it. 

So I would like to ask the developers to create the app that has the same feature like the majority of the other apps have, Sync with an optional lock code, no internet required."
App is Great, But.... It is incredibly annoying that I have to sign in with my password every time I open the app now. Before the update, I could use a PIN or Touch ID, which don't seem to be working. I contacted customer service twice and have heard nothing back.
QuickBooks Online. The app can be frustrating at times to use, not enough flexibility. Can't make up its mind wether to ask me to sign in or use finger print login. Need option to control where deposits go.
Works well. App is adequate. Performs most functions that I need on the quick.  Would like more report options.  Biggest complaint is the need to continuously enter account and password.  I have enabled Touch ID.  Only about 25% does the app actually use Touch ID.  Rest forced to enter password.
It's glitchy!. Although it fulfills the need of having the ability to create estimates on the spot and re-send invoices quickly, it has glitches which are frustrating. On occasion it stalls and goes out of the app requiring you to log on several times and even restart your phone before be able to access the app.
Very good app. :)
Professional and practical. Love this app! Makes my business paperwork so much easier!
Business owner MUST HAVE. Great app to work on the go. Create, modify and email invoices. Keep track of anything financial on your handheld device. Fully automated office on the go for the busy self employed entrepreneur.
"I love it!. For the most part it's works great! Deff worth the money!

Update 8/24/16 got a new phone with updates. Now every time I open app I have to login with full password, thumbprint and 4 digit password don't work. (They are turned on and work for a couple hours after main login with full password but than turn off again...) very aggravating.."
"As large a company as Intuit is, where's the support?. I can't imagine that as large of a company as Intuit/Quickbooks is that they can't fix these constant issues with this app. It's been working ok until this last update. I have to physically go to the Help section and hit the refresh button for sales receipts to show received after I enter them. 
And as everyone else has pointed out, TouchID is no longer working."
Excellent application. I like it, amazing app 👍🏼
Is an average app. Is a good app but with all these update is confusing my customers and sometimes they can't pay online. I can't access it from my phone sometime. It's in and off so be warned and be patient. This is an important tool for my business.
Same as other free app. Wave does the same and it's free... Once it's finish my period I am out.
"Update broke the app. Since the update I have to type my password each time I open it after it has been closed for a while. This doesn't work in front of customers. (yes, I enabled touchID. The problem seem to be hitting others and is based on now intuit decided to ""fix"" touchID by breaking it in this version)"
Since last update app is glitchy. Usually this app works great but since last update it has a couple glaring glitches that make it less then desirable to use.
Great!!!. Update aug 2016: they fixed glitches! The app is back to working stellar!  I do invoice, enter my expense taking pics of receipts and email my invoices out for immediate payment I live QBO. I'd never go back to desktop version! Older review: I love this app I love QBO what else is there to say. Recent update created tons of issues With iOS 9.3.3 some glitches evolved not sure who's fault but hope they get fixed. I appear to get error messages entering my expenses :(. Can't save invoice created either please fix. Otherwise when the app works it's great one star is its current state.
nice app. Good to run the business with this app
Life saver. Apart from the fact I have to input my password every time, this app is a great compliment to the version I use on my laptop. So easy to use, can invoice on the spot. Very happy.
Great App!. Great app!
Can't see vendor activity. Needs improvement.  When a vendor is asking for info about payment, I can't see any of that info from the app.  I have to go into the computer to look at vendor activity, which means I also need to be in a wifi location.
Bookkeeper 60. Excellent app. Would be 5 stars but still has bugs...most notably Touch ID login.
Touch ID doesn't work; features spread across too many apps. Intuit still spreads all the QuickBooks features across various versions of apps (Online, Self Employed, desktop, etc) that all require separate subscriptions and there's not one single app that can do it all. Touch ID on this app is broken so it only offers fingerprint access within a few minutes after the first unlock. Then, it's back to password. I really wish there were better alternatives.
Touch ID doesn't work. Other than that this is a great app. It is easy to use except that I have to type my password every time I open the app. I love the automatic receipt capture from camera.
Great app!. I can operate from my cell phone and know where I stand in my finances while on the go! Great app.
Hot garbage due to login issue alone. Having to log into the app with my password EVERY single time I want to use a mobile accounting app is the height of stupidity. When I'm on the road and on my iPhone, why on earth would I be forced to re-login every single time? It's not a security reason either since TouchID is available. This password nonsense is similar to what Intuit just dod with their desktop QuickBooks, forcing EVERY company file to be password protected and changed every 90 days even if you have no sensitive data whatsoever. So really this is just another example of dumb, stupid, incompetent and mostly just buck passing at Intuit. Sad shell of its former self.
"Where is Time Billing. ??. This would be a fantastic app if you would just add a Time Billing function.  QB Online has this function but the mobile app does not.  Professionals need to enter their time for services rendered on the road, but this app has no function other than sending a full invoice.

Please.... Add Time Billing that will sync with QB Online. !!!"
Best App for invoicing. Hands down the best invoicing app I have found, it was recommended by another business owner and I am very pleased with the purchase.
"Nice, But Not As Good As It Could Be. 8/19/16 Update
 Still not able to post deposits and merchandise returns from the app.  I would think those would be easy tasks to add.
  The last update seems to have slowed the app down quite a lot.  It also took away the ability to sign into the app using Touch ID.  That was very useful. 
  If you have the app open in the background then you can reopen it with a touch.  But, to open the app you now have to type in your password.  I'm not one who leaves apps running in the background all day.

Posted long ago:
Great for staying on top of purchases. But, it's too cumbersome to move around within the app efficiently.  
  Needs to have the ability to post deposits and merchandise returns/credits from within the app."
Frauds STAY FAR. Called in to customer service for assistance with an issue regarding payroll feature and they told me I needed to add the payroll feature which in fact wasn't needed, they said it would cost $39 for it and it would solve my problem.. Well it did not so I requested a refund within 24 hours, only to find out they also went into my acct and stole an additional $139.58! They said I requested to renew for an additional year, which I did not and my subscription was already paid in full for a year!  They said they have no record of me calling in to cancel, which is documented bc their CS supervisor was able to see it in the noted calls I made less than 24 hours later which is why I got the refund for the $39 but they won't refund the $139.58! Stay far from this company, they are liars and thieves and desperate for $$!
Last update. After the last update I take a picture of my receipt, hit save and then the app closes down. Then I have to login again.  Please fix this. My receipts are really piling up.
Professional Cleaning. Quickbooks makes my company easy to run. The app is just the cherry on top.
Great wee app. I've had this app a few week very easy to work with.
"Ties well to QBO but what's the point of having touchID???. Update:
I like that touchID has been added, but why does it only work when I go away for a few minutes after logging in via password??? If I can get a log into banking and credit card apps with just the fingerprint then why can't I do that here? What's the point of it if it's only when I'm idle for a few minutes and come back to it??? As it is right now it's useless to have it. 

The app is very easy to use. You can adjust invoices easily and take payments within an invoice. It ties to quick books online very well. 

I wish it was easier to take payments outside of invoices, but I guess that's what the gopayment app is for. But that app doesn't automatically import the inventory items I'm tracking in QBO so there's no perfect solution."
Works, but..... Did the update on Aug 15.  Sending estimates from my iPad Pro to customers they received jumbled text, not a PDF estimate.  I can't get work when customers can't open the estimates.  This is a BIG deal!
"Touch ID does not work. I have it checked and yet when I load the app it keeps asking for password.

Pointless, just remove touch id as an option since it does not work as it should."
"Many issues.... Most of the time they come up with an update it does not work well after we update the app.
They should test this updates before releasing it."
Touch ID not working when app is shut down.. Touch ID needs to work all the time. Not just when app is running in the back ground. Come on Quickbooks fix this bug.
Not pleased. For one I can't download the app after I accidentally deleted it.  I also put an estimate in and the phone didn't save it.   When I checked desktop it was saved 6x because I kept trying to do it on the phone. The app has many glitches but it is helpful when I'm not by a computer but u cannot rely solely on the app.
"STILL NO TOUCH ID. I used to think this was a great app, but now with these last 2 updates, I have to constantly uninstall the app and still no Touch ID.  Why when something works fine can you not just let it be.
PLEASE Fix BACK"
👍. Very good app, I'm so happy with it!!
Good for the $$$ needs more features. Need to be able to write and view purchase orders from the app. Also be able to see the cost of inventory items. Not just list price
"Greta app. Great app.

Does the job and provides me accessibility through my iPad or iPhone. 

Very easy to understand and easy to set up invoicing with your logo. Allows you to easily print different reports, calculate gross profit and profit margin per invoice. 

Very solid app."
Owner. Love this app!! Easy to use and don't what I'd do without it
Great, when it works. App is great, seamless when it works. Problem is, it's only about 75% of the time. Lots of errors on the mobile and desktop versions. Any complaints go unaddressed. If you can run your business on 75% proficiency with no accountability from Quickbooks tech support, then this app is for you!!
"Very useful!. This app is very useful for my small Internet cafe business.
I can track anytime my sales and expenses.
Reports are generated real-time, no need to wait for your accountant.
The app needs to improve the Touch ID system because it requires you to input the password after you have closed the app."
Terrible app. Quickbooks is a terrible app on my iPhone & my iPad. It's not even a good program on my computer. It's extremely limited & each update does nothing to improve it. If there was another accounting system I could use, I would.
Touch ID is pointless. Needs work!. The new update was supposed to fix the Touch ID issue. You can log in via Touch ID. However if you kill the app or restart your phone, you need to log back in using your password.  What is the point? I want to log in via Touch ID everytime. That's what it's there for.
Had issues after a recent update. After a recent update, the app seemed to not be saving sales receipts and invoices. I made numerous attempts to save the same receipt. After deleting and reinstalling the app, there were about 35 duplicates that I had to delete. It seems that it was saving all those times but did not appear to be showing them on the app. This took up valuable time in my day and caused me extra work in the process. Also, my customers did not receive receipts in a timely manner. I find this kind of problem to be completely unacceptable. If I am going to trust my company's financial records to your service, this kind of problem cannot ever happen again. I expect your product to work 100% of the time.
Useless since update. The last update brings a gorgeous splash screen. I know this because I see it DOZENS of times each day since I have to log in EVERY time I open the app! Completely useless now.
Down hill. The app use to be great and every time I launch it it would use finger print to open, but now it is asking for a password every time I shut it down. It only asks for the finger print if the app stays running in the background.
"Has potential. I'm not I fully understand why quickbooks is the worlds leading software for small business accounting. I'm dying for customizations for my invoices and estimates. These updates should work like a WYSIWYG editor; immediate updates. Desperately need more room for customizations on the invoices as well; they look like they are from 1995. 

The mobile app is ok, could be great. Some things are not where you expect them to be but I guess I just have to learn that."
Get the updates right!!. App was a solid 4 stars before the most recent updates. Extremely frustrating to use now....especially for the price.
Loyal to QB, but... Must add Calendar and Time Sheets. I couldn't run my service business without QB Online. It's so helpful for bookkeeping, creating customer profiles, creating and sending professional estimates, invoices and sales receipts. Here's what I need: Calendar integration and employee time sheets. As a solo owner/operator I had less to manage. Now with multiple employees in the field and multiple appointments to set everyday, the iPhone and iPad app really need a function within the customer profile to schedule appointments. The double data entry from QB to calendar is so time-consuming and needless with today's technology. And I really need a simple add-on for time sheets. Tap your employee, enter start time, enter end time, enter labor code. Sync it with QB Payroll and done. Dear Intuit, please please please add these functions.
TouchID. TouchID or PinCode does not seem to work for login. It never gets asked when the app starts even after enabled. Please fix. Thanks.
Worse and worse with every update.. The more recent the update, the worse this app runs. Worked great until they changed to a new platform and now it's slower then ever.  To logging in or saving pictures out in the field, it takes an additional 20 mins on the job site just waiting for quickbooks.
Touch ID doesn't work. I love this app but it is completely inconvenient when you enable Touch ID and it logs you out and makes you enter your password every time you open the app. Super annoying and really my only complaint.
Great for contractors. On the go app that helps with contracts and invoices . I can use iPad or even phone to show my clients and get approval and signature for new contracts . Just what I was looking for
"Touch ID still doesn't work. They said they fixed Touch ID but if you do not use the app for a while it prompts you for a password every time still.

App works pretty well otherwise for quick checking of accounts and expenses. Actually putting expenses and/or invoices can be a little cumbersome.  I'd rather use everything online."
"You Need  to purchase one per company. If you own multiple companies this software may not work for you. Unless you rather pay double and in my case triple for each software per company. 

Highly disappointed and no one that would solve it. 

Regretfully invested."
"2016 update is a headache. Great software. Real time accounting is brilliant. 

App update requires repeated login and no fingerprint login which is a HUGE STEP BACKWARD!!!"
Lacking. This app has potential, but it's lacking. Especially the fact that you cannot make deposits on the mobile app, only on the desktop version.
Fix Touch ID and bring back the Quickbooks Apple Watch app. I have noticed in the latest update. I can only use touch ID when I have the app running in the background. When I quit out of the app entirely I have to sign back in using my password. Not good fix this so I can use Touch ID when opening the app up when it is not running in the background. Also what happened to the Quickbooks Apple Watch app? Why has is vanished from the Apple Store? Please bring it back.
New to App. Am enjoying being able to automatically list expenses & add receipts as I go. Other apps promised this but kept crashing. I feel that I can now better control my finances.
Touch ID. The app works well once you've signed in, but the Touch ID still isn't working properly.  You have to sign in manually first.  Then, it allows you to switch between apps using Touch ID to sign back in for a while.  However, if you sign out completely, it appears you can't use Touch ID to sign back in again.  I thought the whole purpose of Touch ID was to avoid having to enter your password each time and to increase security.
App is glitching. Ever since the new update to the quickbooks mobile app, it has been glitching every time I try to open the app. Every time I click the app it closes by itself. It's frustrating whenever I have to log anything in the app. I have to constantly delete the app and reinstall it for it to work properly again.
Quick Books app. It works as good as my computers program! I can do the work I need to right from my phone!
Keeps everything in one place. Great app! I keep all my business and personal expenses logged and in place from my phone. I can also track  multiple companies. Gives me so much piece of mind and way easier for keeping track of taxes and book keeping.
What did you do?. Recent update is better except you've now created a log in issue. Touch and pin no longer work? I have to re-enter my entire password EVERY TIME I open the app. What's the purpose of Touch or Pin if I have to do this every time?
"Another weak quickbooks mobile app. Once again, with excitement I upgrade only to be letdown. When will intuit make a full function app? I love the message that tells me the function isn't't available for my device but I can access it from my p/c...Great, I'm still tied to my desk! Why bother with the mobile app then??
I love how I can only rate this useless app once in the lifetime of having it,I would give it no stars if I could!"
Great app. Rich in features and great for staying on top of things whilst on the go
"Log in feature.. New version requires you to log in each day, while this may not sound horrible, this app was created for ease of use.
Previous versions required you to log in once, then your finger print or 4 digit passcode would suffice. Please bring that back."
Functions well again once in app, but Touch ID is broken. They seem to have fixed the functionality issues that arose last update within the app, but the Touch ID functionality that they said they fixed in the two latest updates still isn't working as it should. It only works when you switch apps, then go back to it. If you wait too long or close the app manually, it always requires that you re-log in with your password. This takes away the entire point of having Touch ID.
Great app. Works well
Not working properly after update #2. People have businesses to run!! I understand glitches from free/cheap apps. Not something that costs $360/year. My books don't match from my phone to my computer. The pin still doesn't work, every time I edited an invoice it magically created a copy of an invoice that showed up 2 days later. Now I have a ton of clean up to do in my books. It's time for me to find new accounting software.
Very Frustrating. I can't understand why QuickBooks refuses to put time tracking in their mobile app. Time tracking is weak at best on a desktop but excluding it on mobile makes no sense. As a graphic designer who only sells time, this is close to worthless.
"Weak on the Vendor side. Okey app but needs some improvements.
1-Easy to upgrade your your version and IMPOSSIBLE TO DOWNGRADE.
2- Very weak on the billing and statement for vendors ( example when Recording an expense, this app does not have the capability of recording the item count you spending For example ( 50 gallons of diesel * $3.25  = total) this app can't do this.
Very weak on the billing and statement for vendors
That's why I gave 2 stars otherwise it would get 5*
Done"
Still doesn't work. Touch ID is still not working.  Must manually log in to the app each time I use it throughout the day. This is SUPER annoying not to mention time consuming. And time is money!
Great bookkeeping app. This is a great app for tracking expenses sending invoices and overall bookkeeping. It is especially great if you are a mobile service and always on the go, easy-to-use from your phone or tablet or computer!
"The recent update fixed the problems!. This app seems to be back to normal!  😄

QB online works great for working on the field and being mobile!  😊"
"Update broke the app. Since the update I have to type my password each time I open it after it has been closed for a while. This doesn't work in front of customers. (yes, I enabled touchID. The problem seem to be hitting others and is based on now intuit decided to ""fix"" touchID by breaking it in this version)"
Touch ID is pointless. Needs work!. The new update was supposed to fix the Touch ID issue. You can log in via Touch ID. However if you kill the app or restart your phone, you need to log back in using your password.  What is the point? I want to log in via Touch ID everytime. That's what it's there for.
Bad Update. Last update renders the app useless
STILL NO TOUCH ID. I used to think this was a great app, but now with these last 2 updates, I have to constantly uninstall the app and still no Touch ID.  Why when something works fine can you not just let it be.
Please FIX THIS ASAP!!!!. This update is horrible and does not work properly at all! Data doesn't refresh and I keep getting error messages. The only (very temporary) fix is to delete the app and redownload it - daily! LAME! This must be addressed immediately.
Slick accounting app. Just as the title says, very easy to use for on the go accounting and collaboration between accountants & CEO's
Touch ID fail. Please stop making us enter a password everyday. Every other app that uses Touch ID doesn't have this issue. Thumbs down QB 👎🏼
Bad update. Each time I go to use the app I have to fully log in, choose what company info I want and have it reload everything. In the past I used to use my fingerprint scanner or a 4 digit code. Needs to be fixed.
"Don't download latest version!!. Software was great before the latest update.  Now, no more touchID support, no ability to email invoices.  We all remember what apple did with the Maps mess, I wonder if intuit will have the testicular fortitude to ""CAN"" the person who attempted to update the already good software?"
Buggy. Super buggy and currently unusable. Fix your app QB. We pay good money for your service.
Stopped working after the update. This was working great until the software update last week. Now I end up creating multiple copies of invoices and estimates and the app just freezes on the saving screen. I can only finish off by logging in through a web browser and completing the task. Please fix this fast Intuit!
"Last update killed this app.  Tiny bit better. I can't even....  Will wait for the next update G to then I can't use it.

After update today it works better.  Still not working right

Makes me log in every new session."
"More than annoyed..... New update: 8-9-16, Still have to enter my password every time I open the app. Touch ID or App Pin- what is that??? 🤔 
This is so annoying.... Especially in front of customers!!  Tired of wasting my time. 

I've deleted and re-installed the app to no avail.

It appears you guys are never going to get it right...."
"Don't count on it being 100% reliable!. Have been using this program for a couple years. In the begging, it was great (for the most part).  Lately it's been denying my employees and self access, giving me a variety of errors. After spending over an hour with customer service, the conclusion is - their version of the software doesn't function with each and every iOS update. My company sells fresh truffles to hotels, restaurants, resorts, etc... And so, we weigh the truffles on-site, create their invoice while we're in the kitchen and MUST collect a digital signature (through the app itself) to ensure their accounting department will take accountability and pay us in a timely manner. Aside from Truffles being the most expensive food on the planet, they're also the most perishable (90%+ water, which means they/I lose weight/MONEY each hour I sit on them)!  So, beyond not being able to deliver my product in a timely manner, as requested by our customers, we've been forced to SIT on our product and not be able to sell until they fix the problem. All in all, we've probably lost AT LEAST $500-1000 from money literally evaporating into thin air, thanks in large to Quickbooks! Let alone the embarrassment of having to tell our customers we have their product but can't sell it to them.  Not saying the app/software is bad, just don't count on being able to rely on it like we have. Caveat Emptor :(

Update 2016:  Still having all sorts of issues. Would not suggest unless you absolutely need it."
iPhone app switching companies. Thank you so much for adding the ability to switch companies without logging out!! More likely to utilize iPhone app now on the go 😊😊😊
Great app. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😊😊
"Needing improvements after more than a year. The app is good for entering transactions and it does this poorly.  You have to perform searches which are cumbersome. 

Despite the fact on mobile I have entered transactions for only five vendors, it shows a list of the vendors with whom have transacted business with the most for the last 15 years. 

This app only does a fraction of what the full online app can do."
Bad Update. Was close to perfect, or at least practical. Since the last update, this app is useless to me. Hoping this will change!
Deleting app from phone and reinstalling fixed crash. Had crashing problems with update. Deleting and reinstalling solved the problem.
"Dissapointed. This is the frontline of my business as I am a Mobil service technician.  App no longer will save or complete an invoice.  This is crippling my business!
FIXXXXXX PLEASE IMMEDIATELY!"
"On-line not so good. I was a desktop user persuaded to go on-line.

Somethings are great: the app access, however the detail available on the app is not as good as the desktop on-line. There is the default linkage with expenses rather than bills but I am learning to cope. Do not seem to be able to do a job profitability report. Worst of all I cannot sync my bank cards. So lots of improvement needed, idea is great though."
Newest update. Loved the app until the newest update. Now for some reason I can no longer receive payments from my phone. Which is very frustrating. I have closed out the app, restarted my phone and still can't do it.
Great App. This does everything I need it to do!
Last update ruined a great app. Invoices won't save now and a customer file disappeared. Please fix this app back to operational use soon!
"A bit buggy. I am running this software for a small service business and rely on it heavily. For the most part it works well... For the most part. The only real issues I have had with it is when it sees ""suspicious activity"". This causes a lock out situation. I've spoken w app support a few times but there is no remedy except delete the app and reload it. Well- that's not very convenient. I am currently on my 12th reload (yes, I have kept track) and it is working fine for today. No known timeframe for the issue to be fixed. It is most 100% of the time if you log out of the app and log in online. Forget it. A bit disappointed but I am, at this point, married to it."
"Latest update is disappointing. I am on QB on my iphone off and on all day. The new update has me logging in nearly every time.  Very frustrating. The release notes indicate that its purpose is to fix bugs with the PIN and fingerprint logins. It has become much worse.

When I add a customer, I am unable to find that customer in my list."
Update ruined a great small business tool. Quickbooks use to be an awesome tool to let us send invoices after a job is completed on the spot. It also allowed a user to edit payment information anywhere via the mobile app. This is now all gone thanks to the new update. If it is not fixed soon, we are looking into transferring our accounts to another system.
Clumsy, slow, crashes often. Not a great app, times out saving transactions, sometimes saves them, sometimes not.  Not worth the money
Fix log in problems. The latest update made logging  in extremely difficult. I am no longer able to use my pin or fingerprint even though they are both enabled in the app.
Love it. Business owner love this app
If you have an issue reload the app.. That fixed my problem and it works great now.
"Major problems with the newest update!!!. The app was working great until a few days ago. 

Now I cannot receive payments on my iPhone due to a bug in the app and I also cannot send an invoice via email on my iPhone or iPad now.   ☹️"
Refresh Invoice?!?. Trying to add new items to existing invoice with partial payment received and won't let me save changes! Refresh invoice means what, exactly?  Without this function why do I need my subscription? Made office work harder as now must go submit through PC and pray that works...
EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING!!. I've been using QuickBooks for my small business since the late 90's.  I decided to transition to mobile invoicing, so I purchased and IPad Pro and downloaded the App.  It has been so unpredictable.  Sometimes, it will work flawlessly, and other times it's awful.  Most of the time it has to do with saving information. I'll spend over an hour typing in a long detailed bid proposal, only to watch the saving icon spin, and spin. Finally, after 30 minutes of spinning, I'll exit out and LOST!!!!!!!  It's happened to me at least a dozen times. NOT HAPPY!
"Updated Review. Try going to Help & Feedback and click refresh data.  This may solve the Receipts not saving/syncing on mobile issue

And for Touch ID and Pin sign on, go to settings and switch to on. Not sure if the setting stays on once you actually shut down the app."
Was better.. This app works perfect for recording our farm purchases and sales. Liked it more when the TouchID worked, but loving the new receipt camera.
Can't create new invoice. Very troublesome considering this was an app I raved to people about its efficiency yet now I can't even create a new invoice and earn money... Just paid for premium too. Very disappointed and would like my money back for each day the app is rendered useless.
It's broke :-(. Wonderful app, latest update has caused many issues, including signing in with fingerprint or app code. Have to do a full sign in each time with email and loooooong password. Hope they can fix soon! 😩😖😤
Love this App!. I actually find this easier to use than the desktop version.
Updates have made it horrible. I love using the online version. The August updates however have tanked the app. It is no longer sharing information between my iPhone, iPad, and MAC. The sorting feature of estimates is now gone ( pending, accepted, closed) it only shows in last changed order, not good when working with 3 month or longer history. On a positive note, I do like the photo modification for the iPhone. It no longer adds to my photo album, just imports to Quickbooks.
Not a fan of the newest update.... I've used this app for years. With the new update, I cannot log in with fingerprint anymore, nor can I record payments or make changes to invoices already created. Bummer.
Excellent. I love the immediate accessibility of our business's financial position.  No need for me to meet with the bookkeeper and accountant nearly as often. I haven't had any issues with the app.
Don't update the app!. I updated the app this morning and similar to other reviews, I can't use Touch ID. I have to enter in password every time. I'm unable to save a payment to an invoice also. Hoping this gets resolved soon. Previous version was flawless.
App ruined. Come on!!!!! The app is totally  unusable now.  Can't save invoices, can't email them to the right person and can't create them with the correct info.  This is the type of screw up that someone should be fired over.
Useless since update. The last update brings a gorgeous splash screen. I know this because I see it DOZENS of times each day since I have to log in EVERY time I open the app! Completely useless now.
Newest update is nothing but problems. Can no longer update estimates. Freezes and have to close app. Also cannot see new estimates fellow employees have created. App ran perfectly prior to the update. Intuit needs to launch new update ASAP or they are losing my business.
Great!. Versatile and wonderful app
It's exactly the apps I need. Simple to use.  Have all the features I need for my food truck business
Not working properly after update. I just updated the app and now every time I try to edit an invoice it forces me to refresh the invoice and I lose my changes. The PIN number does't work, I added it again and made sure it is turned on, but I have to sign in with my username and password each time. It worked perfectly on the last update.
Great!!!. I love this app I love QBO what else is there to say. Recent update created tons of issues With iOS 9.3.3 some glitches evolved not sure who's fault but hope they get fixed. I appear to get error messages entering my expenses :(. Can't save invoice created either please fix. Otherwise when the app works it's great one star is its current state.
Great app before last update. I've never had issues with this app until the last update. Now I'm no longer able to save changes made to invoices, and I can not apply payments to invoices.  There may be some other issues that I haven't stumbled across yet. Hopefully the app team will have this resolved soon.
Great!. This app for Quick Books is fantastic! Works just as it's supposed to! Thanks!
Can't save to send out invoices. I've used QB since 2000. Always satisfied. Just today the iPhone app is not working accordingly. The app is not saving my invoices, which then allows me to send to clients. I tried customer service. All I got was ringing and transfers to other ringing. Not sure what has hanged now I'm sitting here with no way to send out my monthly invoices.
"DO NOT UPGRADE TO LATEST SOFTWARE!!. I have used this app for almost a year and it has worked VERY WELL for my small business- until today.
After automatically updating itself on the App Store, I can no longer save invoices and send it to my clients. I've tried restarting the app and my phone, but the problem continues. 
I went on the App Store reviews to see if others had had the same problem, and BINGO! Many other users are complaining of the same issue. 
I hope QuickBooks can figure out this problem ASAP before it really starts affecting my business accounting.

Likes:
-Stores repeat client info
- allows for CC payment 
- allows me to include my company logo and information on each invoice.
- alerts me of tardy invoices
- provides me with easy to read charts and measure each months income/expenses

Dislikes:

- credit card payments incurs a hefty fee rather than a monthly charge
- all of my invoices have an InTuit logo 
- customer service is hurting. Wish they had a 1800 # or immediate online chat support like so many other software companies."
Everything I need. The Quickbooks app has met every one of my needs for my small handyman business. I love the ability to email customers estimates, invoices, and sales receipts while I am standing there with them. I have only been using the app for a little over a month but I feel good about my decision to go with Quickbooks online.
Great. Amazing app but whoever did that last update screw it all up. Can save estimate or invoices. Horrible. I hope they refund at least a month of fees because I'm loosing money having to do all my estimates/invoices at my house instead. Needs to be fixed ASAP.
Very disappointed. Ever since I updated it doesn't save my expenses and crashes a lot. Very disappointed.
Invoice and Estimates not saving after last update. You will have to delete app. Then reinstall then it will save.
"New ""update"" = No more watch app, instability. Why did you take away the watch app?"
Happy. Good feature and happy overall with functionality. App crashes more than I'd like it too and wish some of the custom entered COGs I've created appeared on the app when inputting new expenses.
"Errors. Why you never check your app before you launch it online 
So many errors 
No Touch ID when signing
No latest activities update
Receive payment not working 
And this just 5 min of use"
Newest update ruins app. After updating my app Touch ID no longer works and I can't receive payments and clear invoices anymore also it makes me sign in every time I open the app , before this update the app worked perfect and deserved a 5 star rating , you have ruined it and made it unusable , you need to fix this.
Thumbs up for the business help!!!. Take the time to go through the tutorials and this is an amazing app to help with any small business!!!
"Can't save my invoices!. My app auto updated. Now I can't save my invoices on the go. I use this app all day, 6 days a week. I'm in the home services industry and I can no longer invoice my clients, which means I can't collect payment either!

Get this fixed!"
No longer works on iPad. This app is no longer functioning as of the most recent update. It used to work on the iPad. The camera feature is difficult to use when trying to take a picture of receipt. It doesn't allow me to record payments any longer. Please fix.
Almost Perfect. Just missing two things, edit or view Notes Online, and NO TOUCH ID needed any time I try to open the app
"Not just yet..... Still have to enter my password every time I open the app. Touch ID or App Pin don't work. iPad and iPhone data isn't identical.  This is so annoying.... Especially in front of customers!!  Tired of wasting my time. 

Update: deleted the app and reinstalled it to see if that made a difference.  Touch ID works for now. Will update after some use. Bumped from 2Stars to 3stars.

Update same day: already back to manually enter in in password. 2 stars."
Glitches. App has lots of glitches. Try to create an invoice and it was not working. QuickBooks has been awesome up to this point. I run my whole business through QuickBooks in this new update has been a disappointment. Should've left it alone!
Please fix!!. I have used this app for the last few years for my business and have loved it. This latest update has made the app virtually unusable. It won't let me save an invoice, doesn't show payments made, makes me sign in every time even though I have a pin and the list goes on. Very disappointed and hoping this is fixed soon.
Update the update, please.. I love this app. I use it every day, but the new update (4.5, released yesterday) will not let me record payments or save new invoices. It forces me to cancel each time, which doesn't save any changes made. Please fix ASAP.
Great app. Removed and reinstalled the app on my iPhone. Works fine
"Worked great until the latest update. I've really enjoyed having access to invoicing and to see how everything is doing right on my phone as I'm out about about taking care of business needs throughout the day. As of the last update, however, I seem to have lost the ability to see or send any new invoices or add customers.

Along with that, as of the update it is no longer allowing me to log in with Touch ID or pin, instead asking for a password every time.

I loved the app until this latest update."
Horrible horrible app. This new version is terrible! It will not save invoices for payments when I apply them, but then when I log in to the desktop version there's duplicate and triplicate payments.
Still no deposits. The most useful an obvious feature needed in a mobile app would be deposits. Cash and check deposits would be nice.
Last update killed this app. I can't even....  Will wait for the next update G to then I can't use it.
Update killed the app. After this last update I Can't save to add payments or invoices. Can't even take a credit card.  It's killing me.
Best bookkeeping app. It has everything you need to make your small business life easy & hassle free!
Good but could be better. Overall quickbooks online is a reliable usable and productive app. It continues to lack obvious things like an A/P screen on the landing page and better shortcuts to accounts. But it does the job well.
Can't save invoices. Love the app but after the latest update, I am no longer able to save invoices. Most of my business is done through the mobile app, so this is a vital component. Please remedy as soon as possible. Thanks.
Touch ID and pin not working. I down loaded the update; the update was suppose to help improve Touch ID and the pin. However, now bone of them work and I have to sign in every time. I tried it on my iPhone and iPad neither work. Disappointing
Rubbish. App crash every second
"Weak on the Vendor side. Okey app but needs some improvements.
1-Easy to upgrade your your version and IMPOSSIBLE TO DOWNGRADE.
2- Very weak on the billing and statement for vendors ( example when Recording an expense, this app does not have the capability of recording the item count you spending For example ( 50 gallons of diesel * $3.25  = total) this app can't do this.
Very weak on the billing and statement for vendors
That's why I gave 2 stars otherwise it would get 5*"
LOVE THIS APP!. Fantastic app.
"Dissapointed. Really let down by this app. I can't access my transactions on my Amex through their app. The solution? Open it through a mobile web browser. That's not why I got this program!! 

And just my personal opinion, I feel like the UI is a little weird. Not enough options to organize things your way, or to be able to see transactions right away...you have to go through many windows. Also, invoice is a little weird. Not enough space to customize and put additional information in like the older non-web based program. 

Overall, it's trying to hard to cater to too many different audiences and with too many restrictions."
"Incomplete and not easy to use. Privacy settings are lacking as they previously were in the online version. To be useful, I need to be able to pass the iPad to a sales associate Sioux giving them the amount of access they currently have (with the limited privacy settings). 

Also, the login and password system is cumbersome meaning it isn't quick to open up the app to charge a customers card (faster to run it through the online version)"
Works good, but could be better. The app has good functionality but is missing some key aspects of the online system.  The app doesn't do payroll or purchase orders which is limiting. Purchase Orders would make it almost perfect.
Best business finance management app PERIOD!. Bomb-diggity
Best Integrated Cloud & App Accounting Solution. Using the QBO system for 4 of my business entities has streamlined my bookkeeping requirements with great flexibility in terms of user access and cloud accounting. With excellent integration between QBO, the Windows desktop App and the IOS App - I've found this to be most reliable all round solution available in RSA market without doubt. It's also fantastic that you can provide your field sales-personnel with limited access to the App to generate project quotations / estimations on the move. 5 star profuct!
Small Business. I use it for estimates and invoices really don't use it to its fullest. But... I like it
My experience has been mostly positive. With Quick books based upon the fact that I only use the basic service for sending out invoices. Biggest problems have been not being able to sign in a couple of times and having had both good and bad experiences with help desk personnel. I use 2 accounting apps. Square, which I run all cash, credit cards, gift cards and tax based revenue through. Quick books Is only used for my non-taxable customers who get invoices and pay by check. This keeps things simple for me as Square is hardly ever any problem and I have workarounds with Quick Books when problems arise. Since QB handles no money for me they cannot hold my business hostage at any time. And since both programs have numerous reports this also  makes my tax requirements easy.
No customer service. I like the application and the features which can be improved of course, but I can't give them more then two star. Is more than one week and no technical support. I can't buy this application without support.
So simple and quick to use. I have downloaded the app and have been using it for my self employed hairdressing. It is so easy to use and because I use my phone often it's great to pick it up at the end of the day and track my takings in which means I never have to worry about not being up to date. I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants an easy and simple way to keep detailed accounts!
Great App. I love this app!!!
"Brilliant app. I have tried a few other invoicing and book keeping apps and had a lot of problems with them.
I have been using quick books for nearly a year now, and it's easy, professional and complete.
I am very happy with it, and recommend it to everyone.

Thank you"
Down fall in Quality. Not a quality app.  The screen is difficult to maneuver around in. There's no back or close.
Works well so far. I installed the app this month. So far it allows me the flexibility to record transactions on the go. This is a big help.
Great app. Great app. Gives me complete flexibility while operating my small business!
Okay. I'm new to doing my own bookkeeping and find this product clunky and not very easy to use. Issues with importing transactions and program changing dates and the order compared to the bank. It's not very easy to see what account transfers are moving to/from. It's hard to distinguish credits for debits. Poor customer service. No good summary graphs. Slow to attach receipts. Multiple clicks to do basic things. Cuts off file names if there too long.
Owner, Billing, etc.. I read the reviews after I started the free trial. I have to say, that so far the app is a good fit for me. Most of my business is due upon services rendered. The app seems as though it will work fine for keeping track of those clients and how much they pay for my services.
Quickbooks is quirky. I am not a fan because they just don't embrace Mac users. The app is not reliably working.
"Vast improvement over QB Software. I can't even begin to describe how much more user friendly QBO is. I'm not just talking about the app, but about the entire online system.

I used QB 2008, 2011 and 2013. It did what I needed it to do - but it wasn't very pleasant or user friendly. On several occasions - usually around upgrade cycles - I had issues converting data to new formats. 

With QBO, viewing the data is a lot easier, and feels more...airy and open. That sounds cheesy, but when you're looking at numbers a lot, it gets monotonous.

I can do just about everything I did on the old software, with the added bonuses of doing the work directly from my phone if need be. The most important features - sending invoices, viewing customer info, and checking profit loss statements, is all there within easy reach.

A few suggestions for improvement:

1. It would be great if we could process a credit card payment directly from our phones, for clients that already have signed an agreement, and we have their cc info on file. Currently, you have to add the cc info again, manually, on the phone each time if you are processing from phone. This is especially useful with recurring invoices that need to be processed while I'm on the road, and I can't get to my laptop.

2. Delayed charges that get converted into invoices cannot have payments received against them on mobile app. Not sure why, I get a message saying that I have to process delayed charges from website.

3. When I brought my customer data into QB Online, I could not bring in my recurring transactions (formerly memorized transactions) - they had to be rebuilt from scratch. It took me nearly three months to get them all in the system, on and off when I was able to work on it. Totally worth it, but in hindsight I wish there was an easy import tool, which cross referenced the customers associated with the recurring transactions.

Overall, I am still confident that making the switch to Quickbooks Online was the right choice. Thank you and keep up the good work."
"Great for small business and photographers. We have had this for a few years and use the web, desktop and mobile app almost daily. (For Mac/iPhone) everything is flawless and the customer service is great!

Glenn Fajota Photography"
Excellent piece of kit. I've held back from making a review as the requests for a review before really using an app seems pointless. I have now used Quickbooks for around five months and to be honest I now could not imagine working without it. It is easy to use, clear and without doubt a high quality product. First class and highly recommended.
"Not a replacement. Not fast. Doesn't sync well.. These problems: 1. No employee option to add expense or salary in app. 2. Everytime you click confirm on a new expense it triggers error for other because cash isn't an option right away, not forgiving usability design to prevent errors. 3. Fields are inconsistent and don't match with fields in web interface. Whyyyyy? 4. You can't search quickly, you have to click search then click in the field adding two extra clicks which are not necessary in 2016. Should use intuitive patterns in iOS that users are used to, drag down and activate search field automatically.

This app needs a lot of work to be reliable and usable. No matter how many times I sync it doesn't actually sync to the web apps data. It keeps logging me off the fingerprint option. This might be designed in there because human fingerprints change very often? Correct?"
I'm underutilizing this app!!. This app is WAY more capable than the extant than I'm using it for! The best for of the app is on the iPad. The worst form is on my MBP.
Wow. Not ready for prime time. I don't think this has followed through on a single promise it is horribly clunky at importing bank transactions - count on spending hours recategorizing every single transaction you made   Honestly. It's barely better than a spreadsheet for the price
Wonderful APP!!!. Couldn't sing the praises high enough. I run a small, single member managed LLC and the Quickbooks Online APP is everything I need. I can create and send invoices and sales receipts on the go, even have the customer sign right on my iPhone or iPad.
Very easy to use and good app. Very easy to use and good app
It works well. Only thing I didn't like and don't like about other great apps is the persistent pop ups asking for a review. I get it and all but people will review if they want to. Great app though does everything I want it to and more. Highly recommend to everyone out there.
Does not do simple QB tasks. This app does not have all the functions as the computer online version.  I can't run simple reports and the payroll app which is separate does not allow me to make changes to the employee information.  Doesn't function like you need it to and it put me in a bind when I went out of town with just my iPad.  I would not even give it one star.  Worthless.
Transactions incomplete. Just downloaded the app. The first thing I look at is bank transactions. It doesn't show the amounts properly. First digit or two then ... And there is wasted space on the left and right of the screen. Am I missing something or is that crappy design.
"Awful app. My job requires me to input my hours for each client every week, which then gets sent to my boss to create an invoice to be sent to the various clients. Seems easy enough. WRONG! The app 'cannot find my subscription' so I have no idea how 'simple and easy' it is to create and send invoices. My desktop computer has zero issues. It would be nice to be able to input the client hours as I do them, not have to keep a note in my phone of arrival and leaving time every single day, then go home and pull up the note, log in to the site from my desktop computer, and input it all. God forbid I'm not home in time for things to be submitted for the week- guess I'm not getting paid. 

Horrible, horrible, horrible app. If you are in need of a service on the go to input client info, this is NOT the one."
Annoying. I use this app on multiple decides and have to go through a 2-3 step security process everything I try to log in. Which means switching back and forth from email to the app multiple times just to get logged in. Appreciate the security but tend to not use the app because it's such a headache. Also can't do things like make deposit tickets or print checks from app. Very limited usefulness.
"Unreliable. I don't advice anybody to download this app 
It had a major problem since two months and till now not solved."
Absolutely great - speechless. I can't believe that QB has gone this forward in app. Really impressed with the features specially reconciling bank through app. What a great feature. Very efficient - 100% from me.
Sweet. App is so easy and convenient! Greatest thing about it is that it synchronizes with Square so I don't have to worry about writing anything down anymore again. The snap is such a great convenience!
Great App. I love using this as I am away from the office it's so easy to use via phone or tablet
Owner. Great app to take of of business anywhere I'm at!
Can’t save photos or info. Every time I try to save a picture of a receipt or input data, it will not save. Feeling disappointed that I just purchased the subscription today. I’ve tried, uninstalling/reinstalling, turning off the phone, using the latest iOS, the latest app version etc. I’ve been talking to a customer service rep for an hour and they can’t figure out what is going on with error code 10000. I may just cancel my subscription completely and continuing using the BizExpense Tracker app.
Great App!. This app has saved me tons of time and I love it!
"Lots of crashes. I am a new QBO user this year. Signed up in Dec 2015 and had my MYOB converted so my clients and suppliers would be all ready in QBO for me

I have started to use the app tonight just to zero out some balances left over from MYOB import so it's ready to start using next week .... The new financial year

Have found that most times I submit data the app comes up with a note saying that it had an issue, not to worry as data is safe in the cloud and to report the error code(err 10000) using the Feedback form

Not sure why it does this as its concerning - the data seems to save OK - I'm just messing about clearing out data right now so I'm not too concerned - but I wouldn't use it for production work if it keeps doing this

I have gotten the same error a few times when just browsing the data with the app too.....

Will go back to using PC web browser if the crashing keeps happening"
Good app It works. Happy enough. Do miss the previous button on  items like supplier bills and customer invoices. App is also improving. Thanks QBs
Freelance business functions like agency. This app is brilliant. I can check the status of invoices, P&L's, reference invoices, and client trends. Best business app I have on my phone!
sales tax calculation is wrong. when creating an invoice, the app does not honor customer's sales tax setting. it applies tax even on customers with tax turned off. please fix asap!!!!
Okay App. The apps okay to keep you updated on overdue accounts and to see what has been paid.
Great App with a few refinements needed. This app, together with quickbooks online, does everything my business needs it to do, almost. But that's just my business. This is a very sophisticated system but easy to use! Love it
"Phone App FAIL. What ever opinion you have of qbo ... The phone app fails. It will not let you see the estimates and invoices for a customer. 

They exist, in your system but they do not show up in the app. 

Everything else.... Any other feature discussion... It's all irrelevant.  If you can't view basic customer info, the app fails."
Fire the entire team. Worst app. Login doesn't work. Recovery doesn't work. Craptastic adventure
Easy. Easy to use, and has all the features I need to run my lawn care business. I recommend it to everyone. My only issue was getting my subscription paid for. I worked it out by calling customer service and they were awesome.
Still needs some changes. Great program when it connects and saves correctly. Constantly crashes or cannot save work. You have to close app retry. Most of the time loosing the invoice or quote you've created. Needs addressing. This happens all the time on iPad app.
Easy to follow. App is easy to follow even if you are not an accountant.
I'm super impressed. I'm really impressed by this app for both iPhone and iPad. I just started using Quickbooks online and it was pretty cool to see that the app allows most of the same functionality as the online Mac application. I haven't yet found a critical limitation, although I suspect there are some. Moreover, with an online subscription, this app is free.
Disappointed. I love QuickBooks Online, but I'm disappointed with the app. I would really love to be able to do more with the app other than enter transactions. I would like to be able to run the prepared reports I already saved in the online version and print them on the go.
Great app. Saves me a lot of time. Very fluid with payments and bank transfers.
Participated Promoted Priceless!. It enhances your ability to multitask better than others. Sleek app for all business owner's success!
Please stop making my sign in. Every other fingerprint authentication app on my phone (banking, password manager, file managers) does not nag me to log in via password every other day. Why does this app do so?  Please fix.
"Cool app. Very convenient, I'm yet to use it to its fullest, but I love the way it alerts me to payments I need to make or should have received. 
Very happy."
Awesome App. This app really helps me keep track of all my transactions for my pool business. Easy to use and has everything I need.
Setup. It's too hard to set up the payroll using locations. There has to be a better way.
"Quickbooks customer service is atrocious. I run a small business. I did all my invoicing and accounting through Quickbooks. I paid for 14 months for this service. Now I have to find a new service, reload all my client data for over a couple years, all the items that were saved as line items for invoicing and other things as well. 

Here's the story:

Customer for over a year. My credit card gets stolen. No big deal. There is a 6 day lapse in payment while my new card is in the mail. I update my iTunes account and make sure all of my subscriptions are paid and current. The app proceeds for 2 weeks to tell me that I don't have a subscription anymore and eventually locks me out. The app will NOT sync with iTunes to see my paid subscription. I spent an hour on the phone with Apple, they can't do anything. I spent 2 hours on the phone with Quickbooks for them almost verbatim to tell me that if I don't cancel my subscription on iTunes and pay directly to them (it's $3 more a month) that it'll never work again and that ""while we want your business you don't have enough of a history for us to do anything"". I call apple back and after an hour on the phone they refund me two months, tell me to file a dispute for the last year with my credit card company, report the app and write my experience in the apps review section. 

Stay far, far, far away from this company. They are awful and I will make sure that I tell everyone I can to stay far away from them as well."
"Good start but need improvement. Good to have a mobile app but many features missing:-

> Take pic of receipts
> Journal entry
> Make Deposit

to mention a few."
Overall pretty good. Overall I'm pretty satisfied with the app. My one major complaint though is that it doesn't support third party keyboards. So when writing invoices or estimates on my phone I can't use my swipe keyboard which I've gotten very use to using as my primary way of typing. It is to allow third party keyboards, but then they took it away. It would be nice to see this return.
Great App!. I love the mobility of the app. It helps me stay on top of my bookkeeping work while I'm on the go. Makes managing multiple businesses that much easier!
GOOD GOOD GOOD. AWESOME program.  Everything you need to operate a small business.  The IPAD app is incredible. Couldn't ask for more!  We have been using QB for over 5 years.  Invoices and estimates on the go with ease/pay vendors/print checks/ manage expenses/ no sever or computer needed as its cloud based/ with the right accountant who knows what their doing he/she can have an accountant log in.  Unbelievable! And fantastic for around 30 bucks a month!  Who could ask for more..?   Some minor glitches with the phone app.  Overall 4 and 1/2 stars.  Would recommend to any small business!
"QuickBooks online and the apps for QuickBooks online are really disappointing. I've been using QuickBooks for 16 years you would think when they made online it would be better than premier but it's not.
To use QuickBooks online from an iPad is nearly impossible from the website most things on the iPad do not work very well.
When you try to use the apps for QuickBooks online they do not work very well and many functions are not even available.
I'm extremely disappointed in QuickBooks online, you would think by now they would be ashamed that they can't make their apps and on line program work better !!!!!
I have been using the online program for a couple of years, and I'm really frustrated with QuickBooks online, I was pretty happy with the desktop version of Premier."
6s (iOS 9.x). It takes a while to learn the nuances of this app (and the online interface), but once you do, a decent enough experience awaits. Note to devs: (1) the app freezes anytime you review added attachments (eg, receipts) when inputting expenses; and (2) users should be able to modify the method of payment when editing expenses (option currently unavailable) instead of having to delete and recreate the entry.

"Looking for a personal budgeting app. I have spent months looking for a personal budgeting app to replace Quicken Personal Plus.

I did like this app a lot, but it didn't do what I needed.  Ended up switching to Boomeringo which links into my bank to get all of my current transactions PLUS the ability to fully customise categories and very sophisticated budgeting."
"Prestige. This app is awesome! I work on my books as well as my clients. I'm surprise that I can do all from my phone!
Mrs. Jordan"
"App doesn't connect on iOS 9. Ever since iOS upgrade 9.3 and Quickbooks mobile app doesn't sign in, always says check internet connection.
It's a bug in the app and they know it, we contacted support to fix it and they said they are working on it and will have a solution by end of May.
This problem has been on for more than 4 weeks with no solution.
Poor app with poor support.
Not recommended at all."
Great App. Easy to setup and use.
Please add a vital function. Need to add bills but can't. How ridiculous to not have this function.  Adding bank deposits etc. Surely it's time to add this to the app. For me it's unusable
"Please fix mileage tracking, expense categories. Problem 1: if I am driving somewhere the app randomly chooses some point in the middle and I lose half of the trip.

Problem 2: when I go to fix problem 1 by manually entering in a start and end point it is painful. If I put in an address I have to open Google maps to calculate the distance and then enter it into self employed. A map interface would be nice to quickly locate the address and have self employed calculate distance for me. 

Please fix. I want to stick with you guys but this stinks. Also, your categories for expenses are limiting. NEED to either make custom categories or you need to add more. I'm sure your competitors are seeing you gain traction with this app and are hot on your heels with something similar."
Poor. Very disappointed. This app is so limited. Like stated in other reviews, It is nothing like the version you're used to using. And if you get the iPad version it's completely different from the phone version.  Editing is horrible. For example, if you're making an estimate on your phone and you want to go back up and add a line, forget about it. It's so impossible to use. Very very poorly done QuickBooks.  Too many problems to go into it. It's just a very poorly made app.
QBO for iPad Pro - only the basics. As the accountant for a chain of retail stores I need to have access when I am away to at least input bills and pay them - emailing a pdf to staff so they can print the check...  I can't do that simple task on the iPad app - I have to login using a browser, and run into issues where QBO wants me to use the app that is lacking.  The program is already most basic from the desktop - but to lose more mobility - about the only use this app gives me is for reporting purposes and only what is already in there.  QBO appears to be the only integrated system out there for 1/3 of the cost of the better accounting softwares that have been available online for years longer.  Tech support is very nice and tries to be helpful but there is so much help you can be with a software that does have the necessary accounting with all their issues.
Great app, easy enough to use!. App is easy enough to use, even as a noob.
Great App. Intuit is rewiting the eay we do accounting and genera finance for small companies, keep it ip
Love the app. Very fast an easy
Best app for small business. I love it, it's so easy and quick to use. It's become a life saver for me.
.. I had to delete the app as it was having many issues. Now I can't download it again?
Organized. Been in business for 20 years and been using this app for a year. Love it. Still lots beyond my abilities and i wish there was a little more help in the app for the accounting inept like me but i just bring the app to my accountant and they can pull all the data needed. Recommend it. See sales, cost, accounts receivable at any given moment.
Average. Like the app when it works. Every so often there's a glitch. And it takes time for them to fix. Customer service just can't help.
"So far so good. Really like the new version of quick books.  I like the ability to work on invoices while on the phone through the app.  Has made billing so much easier than the old check system.  But even then, when we do get checks, easy to process.

Only hang up is journal entries.  I used to love working of the GL and posting accounts and the online and app version of QB is just not as functional."
LOVE Quickbooks, but the app is lacking. Quickbooks has made my business a lot easier to run my business.  I LOVE IT.  The app is beautiful and easy to use if you're doing simple maintenance like categorizing bank transaction.  But the app doesn't do all the things you log into Quickbooks to take care of.  And the many things you can do in one place is the whole point of Quickbooks.   The most annoying example: purchase orders don't seem exist on the app in any form.  To read existing or write new purchase orders I have to switch from the app to the actual website -log out and re log in- in the middle of what I'm doing...so why use the app at all?
Better than I thought. I would have given it 5 stars but I would like ALL the features on the app just like the browser but is overall good. They're making by easier to use also
MultiTasking?. Would be nice if app supported multi-tasking.
Excellent. For someone who hates keeping receipts. This system is perfect, I simply photography my receipts, lose them as usual and still get to claim my expenses.  No more awful receipts for me!!
"Always on the go!. Right off the bat, an excellent application.  I read 90% of the reviews especially those that are lower than three stars, because I wanted to know what I was looking for in the negative aspects of the application.  

Only a few things I would complain about the mobile app is that there is no way to reconcile bank/CC accounts.  I understand they're in the works but in my mind that would've been one of the top function of this application since it deals with finances and bank accounts. 

It took too long to figure out how to work some of the functions versus the QuickBooks online for the regular PC usage. 

And then finally, I would like to see some of the other quit applications integrate with QuickBooks online such as QuickBooks self-employed. Other than those minor complaints, the application is a great app for someone like me it's always on the go and forget to include invoices, expenses, and payments."
QB makes me look good. QB app is fantastic. I can write and present an estimate right at the job site or give my customer an invoice, or accept payment. In brief....it makes me look good!
"Great app to use with phone and desktop. Great app but needs:

iPad Pro resolution
Splitscreen support
PIP video support"
Easy to use, even for a newbie!. Great app. Easy to use, even for someone with little accounting knowledge.
Master Electrician. This app has done everything that I have asked of it.  Fantastic of estimating, invoicing and receiving payments in the field while on the job site.  Really saves me time.
Works great for me!. I love this app! It is nice to be able to create invoices, accept payments, and email invoices on the spot. No more waiting to get back to my computer for data entry.
"Loved the app until banking disappeared. I mainly use my computer to do most of our accounting but loved having the app so I could accept banking transactions during short periods of downtime thereby keeping our bank balance up to date all the time. 

Then today I went to catch up on accepting transactions and banking has totally disappeared from the menu. 

Help! What happened?

I deleted and reinstalled the app to no avail."
Fantastic App. All-encompassing and very user friendly
Best app. I wish, I was aware of this an year ago. Nevertheless, loving this ....
"Great tool. A great app for invoicing on the fly and emailing customers invoices when they forget them or you need to look up how much they owe. 

No this isn't the full blown desktop/online version and I don't think that was the intent.  It does what I need it to while I'm not at a computer."
Great for Small Startup. Just started using the app as the business grows it has been easy to track travel expenses and everything else we need to keep growing.
Another weak quickbooks mobile app. Once again, with excitement I upgrade only to be letdown. When will intuit make a full function app? I love the message that tells me the function isn't't available for my device but I can access it from my p/c...Great, I'm still tied to my desk! Why bother with the mobile app then??
"Love QuickBooks - Improvement Always Appreciated. I really live the ease of use of QuickBooks. The desk top and mobile app are pretty clean. Keep building off such a great product. 

The down side is that some transactions such as bundling downloaded client reimbursable expenses & linking to a single invoice are not intuitive."
Thumbs up for the business help!!!. Take the time to go through the Orioles and this is an amazing app to help with any small business!!!
Amazing. All I can say is I used quick books desktop version older version, the online is amazing and the availability of this app and the notifications keeps me up to date on every aspect of my businesses
Won't sign in, incorrect subscription error.. Like the title says, can't login tells me my subscription may have expired. I can log in through website easily.
Vendors and purchases. This app is near useless. While it provides some info for sales, there are no purchase orders from vendors viewable in this app.  Just use a browser in you phone.
Limited Functionality. The app has very little of the on line functionality. And the on line version of QB has less functionality than the Desktop Pro version that I used previously. Very much regret going to the on line version.
Great app a must for business. I have waited to switch to QB online as I had read a lot of negative feedback but this is a great app for keeping in touch with the finances of you business and easy for those not trained as an accountant
"Great app. Needs to have a switch company button.. I'm an accountant and this app is great. I can use it on any iDevice and it updates everywhere. I'll give it 5 stars bc of its simplicity to use, however, the only gripe I have is that it should have a ""Switch Company"" button or have a different app for Accountants with multiple clients such as myself. Please setup the ""Switch Company"" button soon!"
Not easy to use. Simple tasks like entering a transaction are complex. App and online QB have a slow response when tapping things. Just overall frustrating trying to switch from desktop QB to the app and online QB.
iPhone App is the worst. The iPhone app doesn't work.  Their customer service people admitted it doesn't work.  Don't even try to use it - too frustrating and a big waste of time.  Online version and iPad versions are good but too limited for price - reports can't compare year over year
Great App. I love using Quickbook on my phone. Very easy to access and a quick way to send my clients invoice and get a signature! I'm definitely paying for this! It's the best app I could have downloaded to take care of business! 💯💯
Excellent App. Ease the booking... Awesome
Love this app. Works great and I can navigate and make invoices and track everything in one app! I love it
"So handy, but still so far to go. I do love this app. It allows me the mobile access to my accounts and transactions. If I have 5 mins, I simply log on and reconcile what I can.
The web based interface is far superior to the app.
I find the activity screen very difficult to interpret via the app.
I hope development continues, and features are added as this could be a 5* app quite easily.
I was a longtime Mint user, but stepped away due to the unreliable data retention.
With quick books online, I have found there have been some issues with duplicated transactions."
"Poor excuse for a very expensive app. For as expensive as their subscription service is, I expect much better from their mobile app. At current, about one out of every two photos for expenses disappears right after I take it. Also, you can't bill an expense to a client via the app even if you have the overpriced subscription package that supports that function. I don't really use the app for anything else as I do all invoicing from the web interface (yes the desktop app for Mac is just as bad as the iPhone one). Lastly, using it only one week I've already had an instance where the app didn't sync properly and lost some expense inputs. 
You can tell quickbooks is resting lazily at their position of industry lead."
Just one small bug. Great app, easy to create invoices on the road and track payments. Just a small bug, when I click on terms in invoice the app just crashes. Other than that it's fantastic.
Really sick of dealing w/this subpar solution. Quickbooks has over 735,000 users! You think they could get invoicing right. Hire me and ill get this done. Put me on your books and I wont let online version work like crap part of the time compared to the stand alone. The banking module is not done correctly as far as form and column sort. Why would you put things in like invoices and not do it right? Give me the reins and I will get it done!
Changes are not good. Unable to email with attachments. The older app will not work.
"Confusing and Cluttered App. I love that nearly all of the features in the desktop app are here in the mobile app. However the interface, especially the home page, is confusing and cluttered. ""Company Activity"" is a bit useless as the default page. Show me the charts of paid/unpaid invoices. 

I think the developers are tasked with including every single feature and that clouds their design judgement. It's not an easy ask but let's make this app more mobile friendly."
LOVE THIS APP and online version of QB 😬. I converted to the online version of QB from the desktop version and I have to say it was the BEST decision I made!  My primary laptop crashed & nothing could not be recovered, the online version of QB was NEVER an issue & continued seamlessly. This app is such a convenient perk to QB - I can't say enough how fabulous this app is. LOVE IT!
Love it. Easy to use and understand. Have recommended it to everyone I know. Great app.
What a disappointment. This was to replace my desktop version.  It did not.  Just finished the tax year and my CPA said about how difficult the online version was to work with doing the taxes.  You cannot bill multiple expenses on a single invoice.  Multiple line items mean multiple expenses.
Great app. This app is a life saver. They have done a great job with it. I have tried all kinds of other apps and this is by far the easiest to use!
Excellent. Love this app!!
Great App!. It's clear they've put a lot of thought into the experience here. Smooth UI and they keep adding features. Thank you!
"Quickbooks app. As a finally self employed electrician after many many years in the trade I decided to try QB online & it is quite simply amazing, easy, intuitive, versatile & very good value, looks professional and cannot recommend higher. Thank you, Matt 
M.B.S. Electrical,
Jersey"
Great app. First time running a business and this is everything I need I love it
Cannot edit suppliers at all with the IPad app. I think the title says it all. I started an invoice from a supplier, however I cannot continue it on the IPad. It is just impossible! It just cannot be done. So it is for that reason only I am giving it one star. On the computer it is great, the IPad app is useless.
Excellent App. Great app
Good app. Helps me run my business in paperless mode.  Crashes when I push terms while creating invoice or estimate.  Please fix this.
"Great. Efficient. User friendly.. Really enjoying having this app option for my business. Absolutely loving Quickbooks Intuit Online!! 
Really like it can upload photos of receipts. My only suggestion would be to allow photos to be upload to an itemized bill. Thank you."
Great to App to have. Loving the app. I would give it 5 stars if it was able to function the same or close to the online version.
"Forget using with iPhone or iPad. App is hopeless!. Despite downloading the app so that I can use it with my iPhone and iPad so I can cut out the amount of work I bring home it has the following issues:

It does NOT support pinsentry for online banking. Therefore it does not link with my bank. I have to borrow my daughter's old laptop.

It does NOT pull through the invoice number or client name in the ""Dear Joan Bloggs"" section on my iPhone or iPad. My work either looks messy or I have to go in and edit each document separately. Time consuming.

You cannot customise statements.

I am in dispute with quick books over these issues as I have been sold an accounting package and app which is not ready for sale to the public despite the spurious claims in the bumf above."
Too Many Error Messages. For what you pay for a QuickBooks Online account, this app for iPad and iPhone is really disappointing. I get an error message almost every single time I try and enter a new transaction. Sometimes it works despite the error message, sometimes it doesn't. But I get the error every time. I can't even access the banking functions as I get an error message and nothing will load. The only function that seems to work properly is the Reports section.
Best Accounting Software. Best investment made so far on quickbooks and the app just excels... this is really awesome :) big ups Intuit
Really disappointed. We switched from a cheap little program called Easybooks as we are now using a bookkeeper and a CPA. We thought it would be better for us as a business. Now we hope it gets better because I think we have had the worst. First we are limited on what can be uploaded. For us it was nothing. Hand entering it all. Two years of business. Next our bookkeeper went to upload our bank statements and expenses with all of us thinking it would merge the info. Well it deleted everything we had worked for 3 weeks to enter. We called Quickbooks and their answer was sorry enter it again. So I now have to tell my staff to redo everything again. I could not understand why such a large company like they are can't program an automatic backup for mass data loss as our bookkeeper was using an accountant login and not an inter-company. Anyway damage is done now we are spending the weekends re-entering. Thanks Quickbooks
Needs work!. Not very user friendly... Makes me download my companies data every time I login and TAKES FOREVER and sometimes crashes while downloading it so have to restart the download again. QBO is great but they really need to work on the app cause I could really use it when on the road. But incapable due to its functionality at the moment.
Work as expected. Good apps
Quality product. I've just taken over the accounts for the business with little experience and knowledge and I have found quickbooks online very easy to use. Issuing invoices and  running payroll is quick and simple. The support is extremely good too from professionals who know what they are doing not just anybody in a call centre reading a script.
Missing too much functionality. Basic features like looking at an account are missing. My chart of accounts are listed but clicking to view transactions says this account not viewable in the mobile app.
Invaluable tool!. QBO app is invaluable for me as a small business owner. Having access to all my funicular data, customer records and invoicing is fantastic! The app works flawlessly.
TouchID?. Would be nice if app supported TouchID since it will not save your password and logs you off automatically.
Best Accounting Software I've tried. This has got to be the most intuitive feature rich reasonably priced cloud computing package for small business I've ever seen. Waaay better than MYOB, such a great little app.
No payroll. Subscribed to payroll using desktop at the office, tried to access using iphone app on the field but could not find it. Waste of money!
Beware of the positive reviews. If you read the positive reviews they are all slanted to quick books online service as a whole. Some of the comments do not even apply to the app. This app is one of the worst I have ever used I use QuickBooks online and on my Mac or through the web portal it does what I need it to do. I can't think of a single time I have used this app and it did not crash or have a fatal error.
"Good app but could be better. Overall I love the app. I've been using my iPad pro for traveling more but we need this app up to speed. In sales view I would love a simple addition to show next to the invoice if it was sent, opened or not sent. It's a simple change and would save a lot of time instead of having to open up each invoice. Also, would like to see a total amount of outstanding invoices at the top, not just divided out in overdue and due. I'd also like in sales view to be able to sort by PO number and invoice number. 

Would also be nice to have a note icon next to each invoice number that if we click on it, it opens to show the notes we wrote.

Another note that I have been requesting on all QuickBooks online apps for a while now is the feature the billings App used to have for free. 

A simple list of all the clients emails for that particular company in a list with a check box next to each. We can select our repeats to automatically select those for estimates and invoices. But we can easily click to add others or remove them. 

It helps so much to have all of those email addresses for each specific client to select from. Currently, we have to go in to the clients info page and add the email there or go and copy / paste it into my email. Both do not seem very organized were thought out for an app it's expensive considering the free app you took over had it before. Plenty of large companies just bringing freelancers or they have different people handling billing. We need a faster, simpler solution to select company email addresses foe each estimate/invoice.

Please address these issues. If so I will change my rating to five for sure but right now there is room for improvement."
Too Much Missing. The app could be useful, but is a pain. Does not have an option to add Bills, which is most of what I want to use it for. Constantly asks for password rather than Touch ID, making it a pain to use, or worse - encourages you to use a simple password. Hopefully both will get fixed soon.
Great app to run my business. Easy invoicing have app set up and operating in less then 30 min
"So convenient. I love doing my books as I go throughout my day.  Sending invoices, estimates and sales receipts on the fly right from my phone, even reconciling accounts!  It's probably saved me at least 20 minutes a day.  

I'd like them to allow us to automatically (immediately) download transactions as I make purchases or deposits as I can do with QB for Mac, but I think they're actually updating that functionality as we speak...

I also want to know when an invoice or sales receipt was sent and see it in my sent folder...

But I wouldn't go back at this point...too many pluses."
Hate Repeated Login Verification. Decent app. Not nearly as good as full site, but I guess that is to be expected. I have to repeatedly verify my login from my devices which is incredibly annoying.
Dangerous. This app would like customer number, passcode and security number if you want to sync bank accounts. This has been confirmed by Lloyds, bank of Scotland and Santander that doing this is dangerous. As you are giving them information they need to access your account and if anything went missing you would not be protected and this information should not be inserted at anytime
App problems. Okay!! So for like 2 years, your app will not configure with the desktop version and none of the email addresses get updated. So in my case, I had been sending invoices to the wrong person and couldn't figure out why I wasn't getting paid? Fix this like it used to work 3 years ago
Easy to use but missing some features. It's a great app but missing some features. I need to see quantity for my products and be able to create purchase orders from vendors and receive inventory.
Great timesaver. I used the free app and i have made up my mind that i will be purchasing this for my small construction business.
Great app. Makes life easy. One addition will make it perfect. Add journal entry to the app.
Super & excellent apps. Very user friendly application . I would recommend this software to other people
Great. Great app for on the go use
Great app. The Quickbooks application allows me to quickly see my bank accounts, profit and loss statements, balance sheet, invoices etc.
Quickbooks all the ways. Great product, services, app
Portable. Great app for running a business on the road. I wish it had progressive invoicing....but overall I am happy.
Great app. Had quick books for a while, the app is easy to use and has most of the futures that you would need on a phone... Any bigger thing use a comp.
Great Functionality Across Platforms. I use QBO to do estimates and invoicing on a laptop, iPad and iPhone. I occasionally swipe a credit card too and they all perform very well. Little bit presentation on each device but they all work!
Saves time. Transition good. Works well. I hoped QB online would save time and allow us to stay current with renovation project costs and P&L. It has. Transition from desktop to online went well. QB phone help was easy which had me running in a few days. All entry procedures are straight forward and more simple. I am starting to enter all expenses and invoices from my phone when receipts are fresh in my mind. 1Q16 results were entered and up to date by 4/1/16 :)
Transformed the way I do business. Quickbooks Online combined with the Quickbooks App have changed the way I do business. I don't have everything figured out but that is on me to get sorted out.  Very flexible and stable.
"Constant Program updates full of bugs. QB - I'd give 0 stars if I could.  Over the past 1-2 years Intuit has apparently decided to hire lots of useless programmers to write updates.  My online reports don't run correctly too often suddenly.  I get constant error messages.  Program freezes are now suddenly common.  Even things like the running totals in my registers disappeared in one of the late updates.  Why QB?! Why?!

Suddenly my transaction order in my registers got reversed, supposedly because that is how bank statements show it that way.  Though not my bank.  Thanks for nothing QB!

Suddenly instead of just logging in with my userid and pword, QB has decided that I additionally need an emailed access code now to log in each time.  Why?!  I already enter an id and password to log into my computer, and another to get into QB, and now yet ANOTHER by email or text just to log in to QB.  Why?!  Why?!

This is an AWFUL accounting program.  I'm a cpa and know how to evaluate an accounting program.  I quit recommending QB to clients.  And anyone in the market for accounting software should NOT buy this awful program."
"Brilliant app with loads of features!. So easy to use. So easy to learn. Instant bank feeds. Invite your Accountant & Bookkeeper & other users.  So much support from Intuit & the Australian team. What's not to like? 

Intuit have put together a great product for the small to medium business owner. 

Thoroughly recommend this product."
Fantastic for on the go.. Customers pay me and I put it right in the app. No waiting until I get home to forget. Love this app.
"Ties well to QBO. The app is very easy to use. You can adjust invoices easily and take payments within an invoice. It ties to quick books online very well. 

I wish it was easier to take payments outside of invoices, but I guess that's what the gopayment app is for. But that app doesn't automatically import the inventory items I'm tracking in QBO so there's no perfect solution."
Works Great!. For an app this is very powerful and lets you know the basics on the run.
Easy to use. Love this app, easy to use.
Terrible App. You are unable to view and use the register, reconcile accounts and other simple everyday banking tasks. Logging into your company through a mobile browser, such as the Google Chrome app for iPad, does give you access to some but not all tasks. Isn't the purpose of online banking to be able to perform all banking from mobile devices?
Streamlines my life. Love the app. User friendly. Will give it 5 stars when it has photo recognition of my receipts and auto populates data from the photo.
Bank transactions not loaded. There are several limitations with this app. But my major issue is the inability to load bank transactions. The connected bank account goes sometimes for weeks or months without the transactions transferred to QB. Other times they are uploaded every couple of days. There is no option to upload the transactions manually through the app. I called customer service but no one helped. This makes the phone app pretty much useless.
Convenience is nice. Nice to be able to access clients remotely and get most information. Would be nice to have full functionality in app. Some functions are slow going from screen to screen.
iPad functionality very limited. The app doesn't let you do everything, eg. payroll, tax filing etc. Exactly the stuff that is time sensitive and therefore needed on the go. Unfortunately even the website direct refuses to let you do everything when accessing with an iPad. iPad's and iPad pro's are as big as laptops yet we can't use them for Quickbooks online - needs to be fixed or users will be forced to migrate to one of the many many other automated online options that let you function through the online portal regardless is device.
Well done. Good app to compliment online services
Awesome app. This is a brilliant app. I have all my invoices and expenses at my fingertips. Very easy to use and synchs perfectly with QBO on my Mac. Keeps me on track with daily reminders of overdue invoices. No one gets away with not paying me now.
Great for invoices on the go. Being able to do estimates and have it linked with the office is great.
Simple, yet Capable. Does everything I need and I love being able to use it online, iPhone and iPad. On the go flexibility is a must and this app does that flawlessly!
Excellent App. I used to use invoice2go and since moving to quick books online it makes everything so much easier I can sync to my bank accounts and this itself is saving me time reconciling is a breeze now.
QBO App. Very good indeed!
Awesome! Just needs mileage. I really love the ease of adding expenses on the go. I can take images of receipts easily on my phone and it updates to my Quickbooks online. I can easily categorize by class and it's great. I wish the receipt feature would do a smart scan and import details and make the image look better like Expensify does. Also, this app (and Quickbooks Online Plus) really need to add a mileage tracking system to integrate so it's all in one place. I travel a lot for business and would love that!
Not good for multiple businesses. This app is very basic.  Can't even view multiple accounts without logging out and logging back in.
Great for my small business. Integrates well with my online booking app and square reader. Helps me to stay organized, spend less time doing administrative duties and more time to focus on what I love to do.
Good app. Very useful
Limited but powerful. The Quickbooks app for the iPad works well with the online system. Some limitations are inherent with the app that you have to go to the web based system from the desktop to accomplish. You can't create a statement with dunning notices, but you can send the invoice! From the job site, a quick invoice to the client helps improve cash flow and enhance customer relations.
Linked bank account. Locked out. No customer service.. There is literally no phone support whatsoever for the mobile app. I'm still locked out of this app after linking my checking account.
"Great app. I don't understand what some people are complaining about it. This app works great. 
Thank you"
Excellente app!. Excellent App!
Convenient.. This app makes book keeping a breeze. Billing can be done on the go. I no longer end up behind on my billing do to not being in the office.
"App works well on high speed LAN, not so much on slower and spotty connections. This app is not really a thick client app, it is constantly going to a server for data.

That works well in a perfect LAN setting, not so much in say a hotel room or using the built in networking of the IPad.

Example: sometimes the vendors list won't populate when creating a transaction. Trying to create the vendor won't work, because it does check back with the server to see if the vendor exists already. So your stuck, you can't add the vendor to the transaction. Workaround: just add the vendor name, then append 2 or 3 or 4 after the name to get past the server check."
Owner. Useful for small business. Able to use mobile app and coordinate with online.
Great invoicing app. Works great for invoicing needs.
Great app. Love this app!
Great accounting apps. Great apps..
"Very Nice!. I love have this power in my phone! I can email invoices or print them out, ALL on my phone! 
This app is Easy to learn and soooooo fast when you get used to it. There was A Lot of thinking when they designed this app, WOW"
Awful. iPhone app pretty much unusable in the real world.  Always wants to be signed in each time you open it, Touch ID feature doesn't work.  Today it's complaining the app needs to be updated before I use it, it then directs me to the App Store where it shows I already have the latest version!
Great app. Very happy with this app!
"Dissapointing. Update- now my iPad ap asks me to rate it, but it locks the whole screen up. Kills me. 

Used to love this ap. but it has been garbage for some time now. Takes forever to login and load on my iPhone (even slower on my iPad). Once you are finally in adding new customers or saving estimates is just as bad. Have called customer support to find out what is going on and received the response ""we know about the issue and we are working on it"". This was over two months ago. I was added to their escalation list and have yet to receive an update. Horrible customer service. Actively looking for a different direction for our business."
If only I could run Payroll. The only thing the App is Missing is the Ability to run Payroll from the App. If it had Payroll it would be a 5 star App rating.
Great App. Just started my own business and having quick books is a lifesaver. Easily customized and user friendly. The app saves time since I can maintain my books on the go and my cpa sees the same thing instantly. Great app for a service business
LOVE THIS APP and online version of QB 😬. I converted to the online version of QB from the desktop version and I have to say it was the BEST decision I made!  My primary laptop crashed & nothing could not be recovered, the online version of QB was NEVER an issue & continued seamlessly. This app is such a convenient perk to QB - I can't say enough how fabulous this app is. LOVE IT!
Great Mobile App. This app is perfect for my business. I'm out of the office majority of the day so being able to send or create estimates and invoices is very nice. Quick and easy
"Great for one business. I have been using mint for the last two years and I really like that because of the versatility. The only thing that bothered me was it wouldn't let me import into TurboTax. I upgraded and everything is great except I wish that it was more customizable. I have three different businesses that I report on but it only lets you separated into either personal or business. Then it clumps all the transactions together. Also, you can't add categories. I give regularly to charity and there is nothing to differentiate that. 
I'm going to have to use both apps now which bothers me because all they really had to do was add the ""deduct your miles"" function and let me upload to TurboTax and the $12 a month would've been well worth it. Right now I would say that this is ""mostly worth it"""
Good but could be better. Overall quickbooks online is a reliable usable and productive app. It continues to lack obvious things like an A/P screen on the landing page and better shortcuts to accounts. But it does the job well.
"awoolridge. I like the app and actually find it easier to record payments from customers than the online version. However, it is frustrating that you cannot perform all duties ie. creating estimates and invoices etc..
Let's ramp it up QB. ;-)"
Perfect App for Any Small Business Owner. As a QBO Pro Advisor my opinion may be somewhat biased but I can not brag enough about the software, customer support and resources offered by QuickBooks/Intuit.  QBO has allowed me to become a completely virtual bookkeeping firm, increasing my service area, customer satisfaction and turn around time. Love love love them!!
Great So Far. Using quickbooks for the first time, so far, input is quick and easy. This app is making it possible to start my own business.
"Absolutely Fantastic!. This app is incredible. Having been using for 6 months, and it has revolutionised the way we are able to do business.
So easy to setup, use and understand.

I highly recommend to anyone that needs an easy order/invoice/sales system for their business."
"Not as Quick as Desktop. This is a good start for working while mobile, but needs a lot more work to compete with the desktop version.
Expense entries made in webpage are not showing in the expenses in the iOS app. They show in the bank account. This looks like a glitch or compatibility issue.
Tricky to work with, due to not having consistent features (Webpage and app).
Hope this improves, as this is very useful."
Perfect app. Perfect app
"Big help but needs more. The accessability of the mobile app is a very nice feature. I love to scan and enter receipts right when I make purchases. 
I switched from the desktop version to the mobile version but I was not aware of the major changes in the platform. The desktop version does so many more things than the mobile version does. 
Overall it's worth using the mobile app. I discovered I was losing thousands of dollars in deductions per year because I was losing receipts in the field.  My CPA is much happier with me now."
Love QB Online. I love everything about it. My favorite features are the QB app and being able to process bids and invoices from my phone!  And being able to accept online payments thru the invoicing feature is awesome too.
"Not seamless, very frustrating. Why isn't ""Transactions"" listed as a choice in the left menu bar?! I wish the choices in that list were the same as they are on the web version of QuickBooks Online, making it a truly seamless solution. I also can't edit a transaction in the app once it's been saved, or make it a split transaction. So I have to go to web version anyway. This makes the app useless much of the time. It's incredibly frustrating, and if my accountant didn't ask that I work in QuickBooks, I would abandon it in an instant."
Great app!. Super convenient to track all my business transactions on the go. Recent updates have made it much easier and more features are accessible.
Great mobile app but.... Great mobile app, very convenient. However, I could really use a way to do bank deposits on the mobile app.
"Lacks a lot of usefulness. This app is pretty good but misses a lot of the functionality that you would hope to have. It can only run a few of the reports and can only assign some of the expenses in the banking features. 

The app continues to get better, just wish it made the big leap."
"Excellent accounting software. Subscribed to Plus version. Good value compared to others with same or less functionality. 
Love how it is always updating adding new features. If you like this app keep posting your suggestion and eventually the Tech people will make it happen. 
What could be better? Be able to send Purchase order to supplier via the app and able to customise the PO form both online and on App. I have been saying this all the time. When is it going to happen guys!! 😊"
Great App. I've been using QBO for about 6 months and I love it. I own a real estate firm (small scale, 5 agents and below) and quickbooks has saved me a lot of time and helped organize my business.
Problems with users that have limited access!. One of my employees who has limited access rights is encountering error messages when trying to add a customer and also cannot select and income account to tie a new product or service too. Both of these things work correctly for him on the web version but the iPad app seems to have errors in it.
Best version yet!!. I run a company with revenues over  2 million dollars annually with QB. I can take care of everything I need from invoicing, estimating and Accounts payable to payroll and everything in between. The app adds even more flexibility by not requiring my laptop or tablet to create these. The reports and reconciliations are second to none.
"Not useable in multi-user environment. Yup, yet again another update, and still not useable in multi-user.  My business has more than 1 user account.  Locations and Classes do not work in their accounts.  How many years will this take to fix a bug that has been present since day 1?

Another update and I stand behind my previous review(s).

Seriously? Another update, and still not multi-user friendly.  But, oh boy, something works with Apple Watch.  When will Intuit fix the multi-user issues?  Someone else mentions they fix bugs.  I can say the exact opposite - they leave bugs for years!

I want to use and like this app. I've looked at every update since the very 1st version.  It does seem to be slowly improving, but is still not useable for my company."
Excellent. Great mobile App from Intuit, QuickBooks online is great and although a bit different from the desktop version it has greatly improved the way I work with my clients
Spam generator. Don't get involved with intuit. They're stalkers. Whatever utility the app has is outweighed by the spam
Great app. I love QuickBooks online for business. It has helped me make Tree Service a lot easier. That needs a few adjustments I would like to be able to change the name of some of the fieldsin the program like shipping address change to job location also it would be nice if you could change the shipping address with the mobile version the way it is now when you change the shipping address changes it for all of the invoices for a specific client. I would like to be able to change the shipping address on each estimate or invoice separately through the mobile version. Great product that makes life a little bit easier👍
Great mobile app. Mobile app has more functionality than online version. Having the ability to take a note on a customer and add a photo. I only wish those notes were visible to the online version. Currently they are not.
Everything I need at my fingertips. The app is great for my service business, especially when a prospective client calls needing immediate help.  There is no need to head to my office to start a client file before billing them.  Everything can happen is seconds, on site, as they watch.  And I can send them a receipt showing the balance paid before I back out of the driveway.
Great app. For my business is been really helpful app. I'm a painter contractor, check job all day, if I need to send estimates and invoices now I can do it on the road.
Elecsmart Electricians Ltd  London. Great app could do with some tweaks here and there but 5 stars are given !
"Missing the ability to record bills in app. Really can't believe they missed the opportunity to take photos of invoices we receive using the iPad.

Apart from that it's a excellent app"
Great App!. 2 thumbs up!
Excellent tool for my biz. Since I got this app on my phone I hardly need to go to the office, or open my laptop. Love it!
Mobile Office. App works wonderfully makes life easy on the go for mobile office.  Keep up the good work!!!
Cool app. I would have given it 5 stars, but it just doesn't have the power that I'm used to with the real quickbooks, but it's ease of use and functionality is still great for a new app.
Awesome app!. I love this app.  The ability to check the status of an invoice or review an expense on the go is amazing.
Quickbooks is fantastic!. This app is fantastic what a wonderful job they have done if you minor glitches in the expense area making expenses billable on iPad or iPhone is broken otherwise fantastic app
Awesome. It's taken me a couple of weeks to figure everything out but wow this a well thought out software and app!
Great App. Love that I can get estimates approved right on my phone!
It's okay. I like being able to do banking on the app but need more.  I can't record a bill to a vendor, I can't mark a payment to undeposited funds.  I would love these features
Great app. I am running a smal business LLC for a tattoo parlor, great app for even simple tasks. Definitely worth the money, and I wouldn't use anything else.
Great app for small business!. I love being able to enter my expenses and invoices from my phone.  Very convenient and makes tax time much easier!
Owner. Great app to take of of business anywhere I'm at!
Great!. New to the app, but so far it is great! Especially when coming from doing everything manually with spreadsheets and boxes of receipts. MUCH better than the QB for Mac 2015 I tried.
Super Simple. I love this app! So easy to take pictures and attach receipts to my transactions, send invoices, take payments, sign docs... Very easy and simple...love it!
Life is Easier. This app has made invoicing for my business easier and more mobile. I no longer have to be in the office to create estimates, invoices, receive payments, etc... Perfect for my marketing business!
Best accounting app. The best accounting app by quickbooks . Made accounting easy
Good software, app needs work. Quickbooks online is a great way to manage your business.  This app, while functional, still needs some work
Great app!. Help you keep track of your business records.
This makes business owner life that much easier. I love this app, intuit is the best period. I also have mint app but this is easier for me as a business owner as weird as it may sound
Intuitive and very useful!. I'm surprised at how easy this app is to use and how much functionality it has. I'm able to do pretty much all of my typical day to day tasks within this app. It's extremely useful to be able to quickly put together an estimate for a client from my phone or categorize a transaction. Intuit, you've done a great job here!
"Almost five star. The app is good, no crashes , 
Only problem is that there has to be away to enter  supplier bills , posted to accounts payable, not only  as cash credit card payments"
Keeps getting more user friendly!. The new video tutorials make it easy to learn.  The portability of switching between the mobile app and the desktop version online is a priceless feature, thanks for all of your hard work!
Download app just to be taken to the browser.. Not the self employed version.
Love this version of Quickbooks!. We have multiple companies and run Quickbooks in everyone of them. However, the last company we started I decided to use the online version to run this company mobile and absolutely love it! The app does need some accessibility features that are only available on the full version but it is still very user friendly.
Love this app. As a small business contractor, I find this app very useful and an asset to our company. Especially when we are on the go, and need to send something over to a customer or view what we've done prior. When I don't have my desktop available to me, this is definitely where I go. One click wonders of converting one document to the next.
Awesome app. This is a brilliant app. I have all my invoices and expenses at my fingertips. Very easy to use and synchs perfectly with QBO on my Mac. Keeps me on track with daily reminders of overdue invoices. No one gets away with not paying me now.
Easy to use.. This app is very straight forward. I hope there are more upgrades in the future.
Good but not perfect.. Some features missing that you get on the website for example, taxes. I haven't been able to add taxes to an item on the app. I'm sure there is an option but hard to find. Also, why does it keep signing me out every now and then. I have to resubmit my password and then setup Touch ID again.
Love it but...... I Hate when I have a hard time logging in. Same password for years but somehow this app throws a tantrum about me login in on different devices. Not cool! As long as the password and username is correct I see no reason for me to have to get a code sent to my email. It wastes my time.
Decent app missing features. Overall the app works good. I wish it had some of the website features such as the ability to post deposits considering depositing money is a mobile activity.
App problems. Okay!! So for like 2 years, your app will not configure with the desktop version and none of the email addresses get updated. So in my case, I had been sending invoices to the wrong person and couldn't figure out why I wasn't getting paid? Fix this like it used to work 3 years ago
Great to App to have. Loving the app. I would give it 5 stars if it was able to function the same or close to the online version.
Handy app.. I've struggled for a while with record keeping and this app makes it very easy to keep records and do my day to day book keeping.
"Fix the receipt picture big please. On the past several months I've had to take every receipt image twice before it shows up in the app. I actually lost several receipts (because I didn't realize that the first image was not uploading) before even realizing this was an issue. 

Otherwise, this has been a great app for my purpose. I'll bump this to a 5 star if that issues gets resolved."
"Awesome App. Used QuickBooks for a number of years professionally and this App gives my clients awesome flexibility to do ""do"" their bookkeeping on the move. I recommend it to all my clients."
Good. So far so good. Wish more things were accessible on the app.
Everything I need at my fingertips. The app is great for my service business, especially when a prospective client calls needing immediate help.  There is no need to head to my office to start a client file before billing them.  Everything can happen is seconds, on site, as they watch.  And I can send them a receipt showing the balance paid before I back out of the driveway.
Still needs a lot of work. I like the idea of having a mobile app, but it's nearly worthless, since most of what I need to do can only be done on the desktop. I find that I rarely use it - unless I'm out of the office and need to reference something. Even then, it's very difficult to find the information I need and sometimes, there's no way to access it. It just doesn't exist on the mobile version.
"Disappointed. This app falls short. For one you can't see inventory. 
Can't create P/O. Can't enter a bill against a P/O. 
On the online version one cannot enter a partial bill against a P/O. 
Cannot creat inventory level alarms. Come on man!"
"Too much it won’t do. For me, this app is long on promise and short on delivery.  If they called it QBO Transactions, it would be much closer to right.  Unfortunately, they sell it as an app version of the real thing and that’s just wrong.

Among the can’ts:
- can’t click click into report elements
- can’t change reporting basis (cash/accrual)
- can’t run reports on most of the chart of accounts
- can’t get vendor details
- can’t make journal entries
- can’t....

Unfortunately, the things you can’t do really take away from the other features.  I’ve given up trying to use the app, because I kept getting in middle of something and couldn’t take the next logical step."
"Great Mobile Billing App!. I use QuickBooks on my iPad and iPhone.

Pros: It supports Touch ID for convenient security, credit card payments, and invoicing from anywhere! It is great for professionals who work in the field like me. It can even automatically input your clients address using your GPS and your contacts.

Cons: First of all, automatic GPS address input only works on iPad and not iPhone. The iPhone version isn't nearly as easy to use either. Secondly, the mobile app lacks the ability to issue a credit memo for refunds or discounts/donations.

Recommended new feature: It could also give you the option to find directions using your favorite navigation app like Google Maps instead of only Apple Maps."
"Wonderful app for Freelancers. Likes:
-Stores repeat client info
- allows for CC payment 
- allows me to include my company logo and information on each invoice.
- alerts me of tardy invoices
- provides me with easy to read charts and measure each months income/expenses

Dislikes:

- credit card payments incurs a hefty fee rather than a monthly charge
- all of my invoices have an InTuit logo 
- customer service is not great"
Not bad but lacking OCR features. Great app but the expense features is lacking OCR functionality that other apps provide for free. QBO please add OCR and auto input of date, merchant and amount in the expense fields. It will be so much quicker to match.
Horrible. This app and their customer service is terrible.
I recommend for on the go companies. I have been using the app for a year and it has work great for me no downtime and easy access on my phone. Great app!
Nifty App!. I really enjoy using Quickbooks mobile app. Can't get to the laptop or pc? No worries. I can work as I go. Love it! Love the layout too!
Love tracking expenses.. Being able to expenses right at the gas pump just makes sense. Taking photos of receipts just makes things easier I wish I would've left the desktop app a while ago.
Excellent app. Keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
Statement from app ?. Works great for me but I wish you were able to print off a statement from the app.
Looks Excellent, Just Too Complicated For Me. I've been testing various apps that would suit my small business/freelance needs. The app is limited which forces you to the website for certain deletions, updates etc. I also had difficulty navigating. I've since switched to FreshBooks which was easy for me to figure out.
A reasonable resource. While it doesn't have all the features that the web application does, it is still an invaluable resource to have at my fingertips to ensure I am staying up to date on most of my expenses and invoicing. I am happy with this app.
Mr. Brilliant app
Major Flaw. The app UI is pretty good and I really like the interface. The problem is that a lot of my invoices are not even viewable on the app. Basically anything that has a delayed charge on it won't show up so there is a major glitch there or something.
"Give us usable features!. Give US time tracking! I've been requesting this for 3 years now but I have Yelp connections! Yay who cares!  People who are working to make a living, need real functionality not stupid stuff like Yelp. This makes no sense!

I want to add my time after getting done working at a client but I can't.  The point is to help YOUR CUSTOMERS WORK and MAKE MONEY!  But you release stupid features.   The whole reason I went to Online was to be able to access it anywhere and if I have my non 3G laptop, I can but I got an iPad with LTE so I can put my time in but I can't do that!  Please give us usable features in the iPhone and iPad apps!    Basically QB online is only good if you have a computer, not a tablet of any type. 

This app is good for entering in my received checks and that's about all.  Thanks for caring about your customers Intuit."
Please add a vital function. Need to add bills but can't. How ridiculous to not have this function.  Adding bank deposits etc. Surely it's time to add this to the app. For me it's unusable
"Forget using with iPhone or iPad. App is hopeless!. Despite being sold this online accounts app so that I can use it with my iPhone and iPad so I can cut out the amount of work I bring home it has the following issues:

It does NOT support pinsentry for online banking. Therefore it does not link with my bank. I have to borrow my daughter's old laptop.

It does NOT pull through personalised invoices, estimates and statements on my iPhone or iPad. My work either looks messy or I have to go in and edit each document separately. 

I am in dispute with quick books over these issues as I have been sold an accounting package and app which is not ready for sale to the public."
Helpful app 😊. So far very satisfied with this app.  Able to record expenses and deposits on the go and quickly.  Less time spent doing tedious book work.  Two thumbs up! 👍🏻👍🏻
Easy to use, innovative and mobile friendly. We have been using QB at Australiance.com for almost a year and I would not go back to my previous accounting software. The interface with Paypal works well and save heaps of time for our online sales. It s easy to create expenses (e.g. Business lunches etc), quotes or invoices on the go with the App + always know your bank account position as it interfaces directly with it.
Convenient app. Fast and easy way to update my account plus banking syncable
"Too much it won’t do. For me, this app is long on promise and short on delivery.  If they called it QBO Transactions, it would be much closer to right.  Unfortunately, they sell it as an app version of the real thing and that’s just wrong.

Game Changer. I love the seamless transition this app allows me to have between physically being present in my office working or out of my office. Every entry is reliable and super quick. Easy to navigate through billing, issuing PO's and even receiving payments with scanned documents attached ALL FROM  MY PHONE!! Love it. Syncing issues? Nope Never!!!! If I could only generate reports within the app so communicating figures while on the go could be seamless too. Until then 4 stars is where it's at!
better than others. I do recommend QB Online and from my desktop it works perfect.  But for an Intuit product and compared to the desktop version, trying to work on my iPad, it sure doesn't do all it should. It took quite a while to figure out the quirks and logistics of the app, I'm still annoyed with the lack of certain features after a year of use.  Like why I can't print directly from my iPad/iPhone which is what I mainly use. and I don't like the form layouts, and that it's hard to change the Shipping address under the same client from the app. BUT, it does sync well with the web/iPad/iPhone and does a reasonable job of keeping things organized, which is very important and the problem I had with the previous app we tried.
Great book keeping app. Use this app with the online version at home. Very happy with it indeed. Support could be a little better. But support is adequate. Been using it for a couple of years and I'm very pleased.
Very Frustrating. I can't understand why QuickBooks refuses to put time tracking in their mobile app. Time tracking is weak at best on a desktop but excluding it on mobile makes no sense. As a graphic designer who only sells time, this is close to worthless.
Great companion app to the main QBO. I like this app a lot. It really helps run my business and to continually update my main Desktop app.
Latest update rocks. Now you get your bank feeds in the app, so you can easily process your incoming payments and expenses. The only thing missing is the ability to attach a file during that process. Hope it's something that will be included in  a future update.
"Best app for start up company. Hands down this app is the best for any size company, once its all set and customized to your company you & your employees will operate more efficiently.
Take your time to learn it don't be afraid to call customer service they are very friendly and helpful."
Improved quickbooks. It has many features than can help small businesses. The app can help you to organize, make use of spare time to do work.
"Constant Program updates full of bugs. QB - I'd give 0 stars if I could.  Over the past 1-2 years Intuit has apparently decided to hire lots of useless programmers to write updates.  My online reports don't run correctly too often suddenly.  I get constant error messages.  Program freezes are now suddenly common.  Even things like the running totals in my registers disappeared in one of the late updates.  Why QB?! Why?!

Suddenly my transaction order in my registers got reversed, supposedly because that is how bank statements show it that way.  Though not my bank.  Thanks for nothing QB!

Suddenly instead of just logging in with my userid and pword, QB has decided that I additionally need an emailed access code now to log in each time.  Why?!  I already enter an id and password to log into my computer, and another to get into QB, and now yet ANOTHER by email or text just to log in to QB.  Why?!  Why?!

This is an AWFUL accounting program.  I'm a cpa and know how to evaluate an accounting program.  I quit recommending QB to clients.  And anyone in the market for accounting software should NOT buy this awful program."
Changed the way we do business. I love this app. We needed something that we could easily use in the field. We can create estimates, invoices, receive payments and even attach check images to those payments. Our productivity has skyrocketed. QuickBooks has figured out the mobile accounting software. Customers for life.
A1 app. I love this app ! I'm using it all day !
Still needs improvement. There's still lots of room for improvement. One area to work on is having the mobile app work seamlessly with the laptop version of the app. I should be allowed to attach receipts to estimates & invoices in draft on the mobile app.
cannot link to AMEX. caution, you can no longer use the mobile app to link to your American Express account. I first installed it in 2015 it was awesome because it linked to my American Express account and I could go through and enter them into QuickBooks very easily. Now unfortunately they have just simply discontinued that feature for some reason and their technical support people refuse to even acknowledge that they used to do it in the first place
Helpful app. Massively scaled down from the Quickbooks online browser version. But it is not intended to be a full service app. It gives a good, quick, and simple snapshot of your business on the go. It also is easy to add expenses and take pictures of receipts from within the app itself. I find it helpful on the go. Worth downloading for sure
"Great system easy to use. One year with QBO now !
And still I have nothing bad to say
There are still some things that need to be integrated into the app
Like if your customer pays you 50$ and owes you 200$ the app won't let you add the payment from banking. But the QBO on my desktop will. 

There are some other things like not being able to have customers send me work orders and some small minors that I can live with out.

All over all I give quickbooks online and the app a 5 star for simplifying my life as a business owner."
Great tool for those on the go!. While there is a lot of functionality missing that would make this app even more convenient, what it does offer is a tremendous help while on the go. From creating invoices to recording expenses to seeing your P&L and Balance Sheet, this app is a great tool and extremely easy to use!
Support. Very sad that for a pay per month app does not work properly.  Have emailed support on numerous occasions with no response.
Simply doesn't work. My companies all use QB online.  I access it via browser almost daily.   This app routes me to an advertisement to switch to QB online, even if I use the admin credentials.  I'll assume it's something with all of my accounts and not a shameless advertising plug.
"Better than Xero. Brilliant app. 
Seamless to use.
All of my clients now use it!"
Great timesaver. I used the free app and i have made up my mind that i will be purchasing this for my small construction business.
Great when it works.... This was a great boon for our mobile business. Gives us versatility and makes us streamline our accounting. BEWARE OF APP UPGRADES.  All our iPhone 5s phones suddenly stopped creating invoice items which rendered us unable to charge customers. For two week we attempted to remedy the problem with Intuit to no avail. They finally told us to contact Apple about their (Intuit) app. Made no sense. They get you to depend on their app then don't support it.
"Alternately great and lousy.. They have now added an additional layer of security that makes it very difficult to use this as a mobile app. It has cost me money twice. The story I Get from SUPPORT is that it was a decision made in the ""board room"" and their is no work around. Every time you use this app from a new location you are required to enter a six digit code that is emailed to you.  Their system is S L O W generating emails. If you are wanting to use this app in the field it's difficult. I am looking for new software.

Marketing with postcards by date is still very difficult. It's a problem I was promised a fix for over 10 years ago. 
The APP updates every time you open it, so your computer thinks it is a new program.

The suddenly and without warning added a new level of security to the on-line and Windows app versions that that requires an email verification. I had a task that should have taken 60 seconds and after 10 minutes trying to fix it myself and another 45 on the phone with tech support, I was invited to call back in the morning.
I am looking for another program.
Recently they have taken to making unnecessary changes without warning."
"Glitch. I like this app in general, but the request to review came up just after the screen to choose which company I want to open. I only have one company but due to a double billing glitch, I am left with an extra step every time I log on the app.  
Not I big deal, I understand, but was no fault of mine and no one at qb can change it... that's what gaffes me. And will apparently continue until, ""at some point it will drop off"", probably next year. Ridiculous."
Great. Great app does everything it says it will
Great for business. It's great that you can send invoices from phone. It would be even greater if it had a deposit feature. That way when you're at the bank you can just look on the app and see and check off your deposits from undeposited funds.
Accounts Receivable. I only use QuickBooks for Accounts Receivable in our mom and pop's Orthodontic Lab. This app allows me to use my iPad Pro to enter invoices but I have to use my iMac to create end of month statements. The app also has limited access to reports so I'm using both the app and the website. I'm giving it four stars because it's quick and convenient to enter invoices and receive payments on my iPad. I look forward to any additional features.  Thanks :)
Handicapping of Mobile Platforms versus online. Numerous important reporting tools and account management features do not exist in the App version. QB developers have heavily impaired the App experience. The huge complexity of importing transactions is an unacceptable burden on the user. Also, this is Not iPad Pro optimized.
Good App. App does what it says it will do!
"Needs to improve. I've used qb for years but this is the first time I've used the online version. Best bit for me is the storage of receipts and invoices in the cloud and the ability to enter expenses on the app. As I'm away a lot that feature is excellent. The invoicing feature is good as well.
The not so good bit.....
Why can't you enter bills via the app?? I get bills when I'm away in the same way I issue invoice and pay for expenses so why not bills. It means I have to remember them when I get home which sometimes doesn't happen.
The app requires an internet connection to function so when not have an offline function so you can record expenses for instancewhich would   then upload when a connection was available."
Owner. I have been quite impressed! Small owner-operator, able to send invoices, estimates, et al. from my truck--Love it!
Great app. Makes life easy. One addition will make it perfect. Add journal entry to the app.
No Purchase Orders. For years now QuickBooks has withheld the ability to create Purchase Orders through the mobile app. This is a huge issue for our company and it is quite frustrating that QB has willfully omitted this feature. I wish there was a way to convince QB to change course on this decision...
Not there yet. I still have to use QBO or desktop app to make deposits. Kind of silly when I'm standing at a client's office taking a credit card or stopping in the bank with a few checks on the way home.
Really helpful!!. I am a computer engineer and being able to make estimates and invoices in the field has really helped me!
Limited functionality. Can't do a bunch of stuff on the app.  Largely useless.  Editing invoices is a nightmare.
"Great app. Easy easy for an accounting knucklehead like me. Just give my acct the password for taxes and keep going. 

Love it"
Love it. This app is very helpful for the business side of my lawn care business.
Mr David Prince. Great app. I use it all the time on my phone and tablet.it works seamlessly with QBO. Invoicing, receipts, checking my account, giving it to my Bookeeper all easy and on the go. I couldn't do without it now.
"Great app. Great app for someone on the go.

Chris"
Best Mobile Accounting App. Great improvements in the latest version. Easily the best iPad/iPhone app for accounting, that sits well alongside the full featured QBO software.
Major Flaw. The app UI is pretty good and I really like the interface. The problem is that a lot of my invoices are not even viewable on the app. Basically anything that has a delayed charge on it won't show up so there is a major glitch there or something.
Amazing that I can make invoices and take payments literally anywhere with cell service.. I think it's an amazing app. The only downfall is I can't add invoices from vendors that I haven't paid yet. Only expenses that are already paid.  Hence the 4 stars. If they had that feature it would be a five star for sure.
Very Good App.... I truly love this app!  It permits me to oversee my business' financial condition in real time.  I use the QBO plus, it would be nice if it had more of the options present in QB Premium for Consultants.  The project management and customer billing customization would make this an even better app.
The best. This app is the best for my businnes, when I use him as a contractor is the best, because I never lost money or forget charge any work. I love it.
Not trustworthy. Quickbooks has some issues with taking multiple accounts under the same email. I can not access my account because my email was used to open a second trial and I can not access my data any longer. Choose better accounting software, overall. This app has no visible way to logout or troubleshoot.
Great update to already great app. The latest update is great! Being able to reconcile through app is awesome. Best accounting app out!!!
Yep. Great app...appart from the lack of multi currency function...and would be great if we could easily switch company as on the web
Top Notch program. I use it everyday for business!  Easy to use and cut my estimating time in half.  I can even send estimates from the program.  Definitely worth the money.
"""Quickbooks + square"". Great app!!"
Disappointing. Anemic version of QuickBooks Online. Not very useful. I would love a more full featured app since the web version is terribly buggy on mobile Safari and Chrome.
Brilliant mobile app. It has changed my life . I am able to do quotes in the run and save so much valuable time .
Qbo. Pretty great app, I hope they add some additional features; like printing a pick list, and a few other things.
Amazing. At last I can invoice on the move and do the rest of my book keeping as I go. Great app and easy to use.
"QB non compatible with new iPad Pro. I recently purchased an iPad Pro and was excited to use quick books online to manage my business. I downloaded this app but when I went to sign in, a message came up saying that I am unable to use the app if I am using quick books for Mac or Windows. Well I'm not. And to add on to the problem, there is no iPad version of the quick books ""self employed"" app (which I'm assuming is what this app was intended for.) Hopefully someone can address this issue soon so I am able to use my iPad for what it was purchased for and able to enjoy the ease of using quick books."
"Not great, but no other options on phone/iPad. This is terribly buggy software. Intuit is not on the ball with development. 
Enter a transaction or invoice on this app, then find it not entered on Quickbooks online. Won't sync. 
Menus don't work or show on the iPad or iPhone. 
Called intuit and they said it's still a young app and they're working on it. I have little faith. Hope this all gets fixed."
Love QB Online. I love everything about it. My favorite features are the QB app and being able to process bids and invoices from my phone!  And being able to accept online payments thru the invoicing feature is awesome too.
Ok but needs work. We have 4 ipad2 running his app to invoice and do estimates on the go. Much better and faster than previous versions. Would still like to see some type of service form so we can make multiple service calls on a project then tally up and invoice together. Also the new activity page doesn't show sent info on invoices and estimates. That was very helpful. They should put it back in. Overall better.
App is Digressing. Over the weekend, a change made the customer not viewable or searchable for invoices. Extremely inconvenient as this has always been the case and now it has been removed and all you can see is invoice numbers.
Excellent App. I like the QB app better than the online version of QB. The app is easier to use and allows me to operate my business with NO PAPERWORK and less time spent doing bookkeeping and office work.
Excelente. Es una App genial me a facilitado el trayecto administrativo un 100%
"Good app but could be better. Overall I love the app. I've been using my iPad pro for traveling more but we need this app up to speed. In sales view I would love a simple addition to show next to the invoice if it was sent, opened or not sent. It's a simple change and would save a lot of time instead of having to open up each invoice. Also, would like to see a total amount of outstanding invoices at the top, not just divided out in overdue and due. I'd also like in sales view to be able to sort by PO number and invoice number. 

Would also be nice to have a note icon next to each invoice number that if we click on it, it opens to show the notes we wrote.

Another note that I have been requesting on all QuickBooks online apps for a while now is the feature the billings App used to have. 

A simple list of all the clients emails for that particular company in a list with a check box next to each. We can select our repeats to automatically select those for estimates and invoices. But we can easily click to add others or remove them. It helps so much to have all of those email addresses for each specific client to select from. Currently, we have to go in to the clients info page and add the email there or go and copy / paste it into my email. Both do not seem very organized were thought out for an app it's expensive considering the free app you took over had it before. Plenty of large companies just bringing freelancers or they have different people handling billing. We need a faster, simpler solution to select company email addresses foe each estimate/invoice.

Please address these issues. If so I will change my rating to five for sure but right now there is room for improvement."
New Business. Great App, easy to use when building my own business.
Very good app. Have a small transport business. This app is already (after only 3 weeks) showing me where I can save money. Up until now we were guessing!!!! Never a good way to operate a business and the data I'm seeing will certainly help me to make our next purchases required for the business. I would recommend to everyone who is in business or just to track your personal financial status. It only takes a few minutes each day at home or take it on the road with you. Works great..
Switching between account requires logout and login. So annoying, especially since there is no support for Touch ID. Why can't you let us switch from within the app?
Love it. I'm no doing anything super sophisticated but I love the app.  Easy to Use to keep invoices and expenses current on the go!
Good app. Haven't had a problem with this app.
Great Program. Very user friendly and much better than the traditional one.  Love how easy it is to track all of my expenses and can just snap a picture of them. Highly recommended!
The App is limited. I like that the App gives me the ability to create invoices and receive payments. However, I cannot create bills in the App which is very frustrating.
Poor. This app makes very poor use of the screen real estate of phablet style phones and even worse on iPads. They also removed the comma from the keyboard, so adding additional email addresses to a customer is impossible. Generally a poor design, this app is years behind where I should be.
"Would like to like it better, but it gets worse!. I personally like the iPad app better than the online version for interface, but it has so many bugs!  Constantly gives me error message that I'm not authorized to do something (add/edit a customer, etc.), but then it lets me do it.  But I keep having to close out all the error messages that pop up.  Often won't let me email an invoice.  Won't let me add customer off of creating a new estimate (have to add customer, close, then do estimate and choose customer again).  The list of basic things that should not be an issue goes on and on.  On the iPhone app, there is no place for my reps to view the contact person's name at the company!  I'm sure there are other things I could think of, but I've just learned to compensate and work around things.  However an app with this many bugs should not be out there - it's pretty pathetic!

UPDATE 11/18/15 - after update, all the previous bugs are still there.  Pathetic to issue an update and not fix what was wrong!

UPDATE 1/14/16 - even worse!  Now I can no longer add an item to an estimate or see the customer name on Estimates or Invoices under ""Activity"". What is wrong with you people?  If you can't make it better, leave it alone! Now it is completely useless!"
Great app!!. Just switched from Quicken, and I don't know why I waited so long. QB is very versatile and comprehensive.
"Recent Changes. I love the app! Very helpful when i am out and about ..
Why did it recently change - making all entries for customers the same. I can no longer see what invoices are open or overdue.  This HAS to come back!!!"
Great app. Very functional and easy to understand. Works well with desktop version.
"Not pleased. I put the QB online app on my new iPad thinking I wouldn't have to lug my laptop around the country anymore.... It does not have the functionality or settings I need in Canada.  It's made for the states, which normally isn't a huge deal because we are very similar.  But I couldn't input my tax codes or even my province! 

LAME........"
"Love QB. Hi, my name is Alexander, I would like to let you know that I love QB, it's easy to use, I can access information anytime, anywhere, and on any device.I have an iphone, ipad and mac,what I like most is being able to work with QB on the road with my iphone. I'm en exterminator and handyman and I invoice on the spot and keep track of my expenses on realtime, no more worries of forgetting to come home and register my expenses of the day and looking for reciepts. I also love the feature of emailing invoices to clients, no need to buy or make reciept books for clients.
An addition that I would like very much is a calendar with reminders like in invoicing so I can make and keep up with  appointments. The way I do it now is I use the calendar on my iphone to check on appointments or to make a new one, the thing is after making an invoice or entering a payment I forget to make a new appointment and my appointments get mixed up with my personel agenda. A cool feature would be after I save an invoice the app asks me if I want to make an appointment. It would be a great update.
I hope my request gets considerd and approved, if not, will love QB anyway"
App glitches. I get an error message 6000 every time I try to add a customer, payment, or any new information. Basically it's not functioning, I have to use the desktop version.
Great but........ I love the app but it could use a bit more integration. For instance, you can AirPrint an invoice but you can't AirPrint a paid invoice. Seems like an oversight.
QB makes me look good. QB app is fantastic. I can write and present an estimate right at the job site or give my customer an invoice, or accept payment. In brief....it makes me look good!
The best billing and accounting on the go. I run a computer support business month go from this app. We used to have QB desktop and had issues with mobility. It was stuck on the computer. With QBO we have the mobility we need to access our accounting anywhere. We use the app everyday to lookup customers, take payments, send paid invoices, create estimates and even get them signed to begin wok in the field. In addition to that I can pull up reports like my current profit and loss to see how profitable the organization is. The only thing I miss in the app is the option to get directions from google maps instead of apple maps (I can't even copy the added on a customer card) or copy the phone number attached to a customer to paste into Ringcentral (our VoIP app)
Spotty & Unreliable. I rarely review any apps that I use unless they are particularly great or particularly terrible. In this case, sadly it is the latter. This app doesn't have basic features that should be included, and about half of my invoices I cannot open from the app because apparently it uses some feature in their API that is nonsupported or not working. Regardless, if you are looking for a 21st-century accounting solution and app this is sadly not it at all.
Major Flaw. The app UI is pretty good and I really like the interface. The problem is that a lot of my invoices are not even viewable on the app. Basically anything that has a delayed charge on it won't show up so there is a major glitch there or something.
Great app but missing some things. I think this is a great start to the QuickBooks app!  It is clean looking and well organized.  You are able to enter in or download transactions, refer to client information and many other things.  My only complaint is that you cannot reconcile any accounts in the app. I would love to be able to reconcile.  It would get 5 stars from me if the app could do that.
"Great app. Accounting on the go!. Ahh my favorite part of the day just got a whole lot easier. 

This app lets you track you individual transactions on the fly. It also lets you categorize and itemize expenses. If you like neat books and your on your phone a lot this app makes things easy. 

It's free so just try it out."
"Good app. I like simple, this is efficient for my small Busines, updates are making the app better.
I can Recomend it is supper easy to use."
Handy app.. I've struggled for a while with record keeping and this app makes it very easy to keep records and do my day to day book keeping.
"Really Frustrating App. Very frustrating app both on iPhone and QBO. Very glitchy and customer support is TERRIBLE. If the they didn't force you to use a subscription-based model, I'd use the installable version on Quickbooks. 

I'm sure other have less problems, but it has not been a good experience for myself or my company."
Great app. Makes life easy. One addition will make it perfect. Add journal entry to the app.
"Pretty good app. This has turned out to be a pretty useful app.  Very nice to be able to add receipts as I make purchases.

Very nice to create estimates!

I would give it five stars if they would add reports for each customer.  The current reports is lame.

Also very lame I can't add and pay bills!!! Come on QB's!  It's a business app. We pay bills!!!!!"
Great invoicing app. Works great for invoicing needs.
Responsive to feature request. We have enjoyed the transition from the desktop QB to QB Online. The QB App was one of the deciding factors. In the last version of the app, we made a request for bank feed updates that can be initiated from the app - such updates are already a standard feature in QB Online. Well, just a couple of weeks later, the latest QB App has the requested feature. We were likely one of many making the request. 5 Stars to the QB Team for being responsive. We are happy customers. Now, if we could only get a discount in the online version for having multiple business accounts...
Excellent App. I used to use invoice2go and since moving to quick books online it makes everything so much easier I can sync to my bank accounts and this itself is saving me time reconciling is a breeze now.
"Keeps getting better. I've had this App since its first release. I can finally rely on the phone / iPad app without needing to boot up my computer - including accurate profit and loss accounts and easy invoicing.
The new bank reconciliation for the App works perfectly and is a very welcome addition for my business. I look forward to international currencies being supported in a future release."
Why are the layouts for iPhone and iPad different. Running this on an iPhone 6 Plus and iPad Pro.  There are more options on the iPhone than on the iPad.  My biggest issue with the iPad version is the fact that in order to invoice a customer you must click on customers and have “No status” selected in order to invoice. Problem here is that at the top, in very large print, it shows your total sales.  I’m sorry but while sitting at a clients table, and they are sitting next to me, the last thing I need them looking at is my sales totals.  I end up having to use my iPhone to invoice the client while my iPad is sitting right there. Very annoying Intuit, very annoying! Why can’t the apps look the same and have the same features?
"PLEASE: GIVE US DELAYED CHARGE ALREADY!. How many times do we have to ask?
FOR THE LOVE OF GAWD, WHY CAN I NOT ADD A DELAYED CHARGE ON THE MOBILE APP??????  This is something you actually WANT to do when you're at a client, not get them to sign for an invoice every time you visit them during the month."
QB 2.4.0. I just installed the newest QB app on my IPad Pro and am still disappointed.  I do not have the same access as on my laptop online version.  I need Purchase Orders and it is still not available on the Mobile version.  This is 2016, this should not be a hard task to incorporate.  In addition, when I go to the online version through Safari on my IPad Pro, it does not respond very well.  It freezes or refuses to update saved info just entered.  Give me a good product please!!!!
Limited. Not much functionality compared with the desktop app, frustrating. Unable to access banking or create bills.
Horrible app.. When the app is down more than few times a month, it's not convenient especially when you have to hand write the invoice and than re-do on qb later on , it's frustrating when this becomes an every week story.
"Good but needs more. I wish I can record bills in the expences area, and on the banking it will be nice to be able to do transfers, and deposits.
Other than that this app is been working ok for me."
Plenty to be desired. There are options such as making expenses billable is not available. Previously had issues with adjusting tax in the app and the support team told me to use the web based version. What's the point in having an app with features when the support team just tells you use the web version.
Excellent. QuickBooks Online has created a whole new dimension to bookkeeping and accounting for small business. The iPad app is very useful for an overview of transactions
"Expenses not current 1-8-16. 1. Somehow my current expenses are not listed under my checking account. The last entry is for 2012. Please update. 
2. It will be super to have the Quickbooks Payment iPhone App also.
3. QB Online Plus is what I use mostly to have a current accounting report and I am hoping it is useful for my CPA when he checks my account."
Good app.. Very nice program. Works best with my IPad.
"Weak on the Vendor side. Great app but needs some improvements ( example when Recording an expense, this app does not have the capability of recording the item count you spending For example ( 50 gallons of diesel * $3.25  = total) this app can't do this.
Very weak on the billing and statement for vendors"
So far so good. So far it does everything I want it to do. If you're looking for an easy to handle app that keeps u up to date look no further.
Quickbooks online. Don't usually write reviews but this app is definitely worthy of a review.  If you are in the market for an invoicing program this is the only way to go!!
Lifesaver. I love this app, it saves me so much time on the road and so much paperwork later.
Good apps. Its a excelent, but in 1 mounth are problem to connect in sometimes!! For all is good!
"Alternately great and lousy.. Marketing with postcards by date is still very difficult. It's a problem I was promised a fix for over 10 years ago. 
The APP updates every time you open it, so your computer thinks it is a new program.

The suddenly and without warning added a new level of security to the on-line and Windows app versions that that requires an email verification. I had a task that should have taken 60 seconds and after 10 minutes trying to fix it myself and another 45 on the phone with tech support, I was invited to call back in the morning.
I am looking for another program.
Recently they have taken to making unnecessary changes without warning."
What's happened?!. Usually excellent for uploading expenses it's now decided not to communicate with my online account. I can see all my expenses in the app but not online. So now, do I do it all again online? Scan every receipt individually? Or do I wait until it perhaps decides to work? I really don't want to then have to remove everything if it doubles up! Pls fix :(
Best business App. Very quick, no bugs or errors. Love it!!!
Lacking Functionality. If you have multiple accounts you have to sign in and out individually.  Additionally, this app has still not been updated for the latest iPhone and iPad graphic sets such as the iPad Pro.
Great but could use a little more. Overall pretty great. Clean easy to do basic tasks, would love access to a few more advanced features...but overall it's a great app. The app is Stable, Love the Fingerpint login (even though it's still a little buggy at time of writing the review), it's clean & easy to read, good navigation. Overall I'm very happy with it!
Some great functionality some really missing.. I don't understand how I can add a bill from a vendor through the app.  And I can't see some really important reports either.  Two of the big things I would really like to do with mobility.
Not bad, not amazing. It's quick books. The app gives you access to some information, but not everything.
Not a replacement. Not fast. Doesn't sync well.. This app needs a lot of work to be reliable and usable. No matter how many times I sync it doesn't actually sync to the web apps data. It keeps logging me off the fingerprint option. This might be designed in there because human fingerprints change very often? Correct?
QB App Liberates and Empowers Me. I use both the app and the online version to much satisfaction. The app lets me easily edit an invoice and see which invoice and recurring billing have been paid. I do use recurring billing yet I set that up via the online version at my computer. I can access my books on the go, and that is what I needed from the app.
Great app. Very easy to use voice to text is amazing can't believe I hadn't done this sooner.
Impressed.. Very impressed with how far Intuit has taken the QB online product, and this app is a nice extension of that! All the talk of cloud and mobile being the future..is NOW thanks to this cloud product. I refer many accountants in my network the QBO accountant version, which is the best solution for most small businesses in my opinion.
Unexpected error 10000. iPhone 6s Plus. Would love to know why I always get this message. I'm unable to use app at all.
Meh. Still not sure how quick books became the market leader and they have been resting on their laurels for years. The app is no exception. There are lots of improvements they could make but they are too lazy.
Great App. QuickBooks Online works really well, fits my needs as an independent consultant.
"Virtually useless. For our SME this app is terrible, but has showed slow signs of improvement over the last 4 years. All I use it for is uploading director expenses. This works well, the only reason I gave 2stars rather than 2.

The online version is great, but the app has most of the functionality missing. Rather than re-invent the wheel I think it would be better to make the online desktop version work on smartphones and stop wasting time and money improving the app.

Missing functionality in the app that comes to mind is:
1) Lack of foreign currency a/c support. 
2) P&L report is very limited e.g. the online version allows you to click on cogs and you see a breakdown, not on the app version
3) All the reports from online version are missing from the app (apart from p&l which is poor). Not even balance sheet!
4) No export to pdf/excel
5) No clear homepage that gives overview of total outstanding invoices, overdue invoices
6) No chart of accounts
7) No reconciliation
8) No purchase orders"
Best app for my business!. Not a good app when it doesn't download your banking, nor did it make good invoices/estimates. I love InvoicesASAP, but this app needs help.
It's okay. I like the ability to send invoices from the app.  However a balance sheet or bank balance view is really necessary for anyone who truly manages their company.
Great but WIP. Better than the competition and BEST customer service in the space!  Well worth it.
Great app. Love it! Easier than the desktop version!
Needs improvement. The bottom line is its a half attempt at a usable app the key features such as updating and access to registers don't work and the work around snare to tedious
I love Quickbooks Online. I love Quickbooks Online & my accountant does also. This app is really good for doing your expenses on but as far as invoicing I still do it on the computer. It's very handy for a small business. The fact you can enter an expense, take a picture of the receipt & go on your merry way. I'm sold.
"Broke a good product.  No longer prints service dates on the invoice.. QuickBook broke a good product.

Invoices no longer print / e-mail forms with the Service Date.

The old version would give you the option to bill by the hour and when you sent out invoices it would list the date of service.

The last few updates keeps removing the service date from the invoices.  The product use to let you update the form to add the service date back.  This version no longer allows the invoice forms to be edited to include the service date.

This does not work for our clients.  They will not pay a invoice if they do not know when the services where preformed."
Great app. Coming from Microsoft Office, I enjoy quickbooks so much. It is so mobile and easy to use. There have been a few questions I had, but a quick search led me to the answer. I recommend the program and the app.
Great costumer service. I hope that they improve the app but so far so good. Very satisfied with the product.
Convenience is nice. Nice to be able to access clients remotely and get most information. Would be nice to have full functionality in app. Some functions are slow going from screen to screen.
"Average at best - limited functionality. This app is not a first release but still lacks many features needed to make it worthwhile. The app doesn't offer full functionality and will let you do thing like create and send invoices but won't let you run your business from the road or while on vacation. 

The bank feeds you set up in the desktop cloud interface are not viewable and you can not categorise transactions. This is offered in the USA version though. 

The invoices look sharp on screen on the app but when you send them they revert to the ugly templates Intuit provide. Also if you run a business with multiple brands / sub brands or trading names you can only use the parent company business name and logo. Massive flaw if you sell over different channels. 

Intuit have a good base here but the development is incredibly slow. Look back at the forums and see that feature requests have been asked for over 12 months and not been developed even though they are basic things that Xero offer. 

Worthwhile having the app, but don't be fooled thinking you can use it for running your business books."
It does have a fingerprint option. I haven't used the app enough, I use it mostly online with an iMac, but since I use it mostly as a sales tool, and to give insurance, CPA, loan officers ect a quick recap of my sales vs investment/loss it's come in handy there. The fingerprint sensor always works for me in these situations but I'm a sole proprietor and I'm not sure if contractors/employees are given this option. I do everything on my iMac online, even invoices, but I also keep a paper trail (hand written, I'm in the service industry). No ones used intuits e-mail payment option, but I hope to convince large customers and vendors to use it next year. I used the mobile app to make a few purchases classified as tools (loss) and use it to make sure square card reader scans go through before I update the invoice online. It's going to take time to learn the ins and outs of this app on mobile, but I do see it replacing 90% of Mac/PC work in the future. Till it can be all be done without a Mac or PC my review remains 4 stars.
Weak weak app. This app is very basic.  Can't even view multiple accounts without logging out and logging back in.  Terrible
Super functional..extremely helpful. Quick books app is fantastic! Makes using my phone for invoicing and estimates very easy! Recommend to anyone..... No glitches, no hang ups..... You won't be disappointed!
OK. Good app but there're better ones
Great flexibility. Love being able to do estimates and invoices on the go.
A Glaring Weakness. This a pretty good mobile app.  One glaring weakness is that it does not allow the manual recording of bank deposits and transfers so they can be matched later. This leaves you at the mercy of the slow banks before you can see these transactions.
Solid App. The app works well with the online service and gives access to the basics so while out of the office you can still stay up on your business.  Would like to see the ability to add and see bills through the app instead of only expenses.
Best app ever. It works awesome I recommended 100%
Easy to Use!. Love the app!
Great app & program - must improve search ENGINE. Fantastic program with brilliant features. It does need some urgent fixes. One being to be able to search through an account such as cash sales and be able to find a name, address or phone number.
Best Accounting Software. Best investment made so far on quickbooks and the app just excels... this is really awesome :)
Paid app. App costs 8.99 a month
Very good app. Good
Wonderful app.. Wonderful app. Makes my life so much easier. Wish I would have signed up with QBO earlier.
Great app. First time business owner and have to say it's a great way to stay organized
better than others. But for an Intuit product and compared to the desktop version, it sure doesn't do all it should.  It's pretty basic and does pretty much what I need as a small business owner.  It took quite a while to figure out the quirks and logistics of the app, I'm still annoyed with the lack of certain features after a year of use.  Like why I can't print directly from my iPad/iPhone which is what I mainly use. and I don't like the form layouts. BUT, it does sync well with the web/iPad/iPhone and does a reasonable job of keeping things organized, which is very important and the problem I had with the previous app we tried.
"Disjointed. Nearly everything I do with this app requires amending in QBO.

Paying an invoice always pays money in to Undeposited Funds instead of my Business Account.

When adding an expense it only offers 3 payment options and doesn't pull down the options from your own account.

It would be great to see these creases ironed out so that something done on the app doesn't have to be corrected online."
Need fingerprint login. QuickBooks is critical to our business but the mobile app slows us down. Every time you open the app on an iPhone even if it's protected with the password you still have to type in your QuickBooks password. Since we use strong passwords for our QuickBooks online it is very annoying to have to keep retyping that on the app. Why doesn't allow us to use the fingerprint sensor?  When you take a picture of a receipt and then accept it, QB still leaves it in your photo stream so you have to go in and manually delete it. Also it's very annoying to have to search for account names and vendor names instead of typing a few characters in the box and having it auto complete the entry. To enter a receipt on the fly takes about two minutes total instead of 30 seconds.
Invoicing on the go!. The app is a great companion to the online version. Allows me to invoice and keep track of billable items on the go. There is so much more it does but for me invoicing right after the job is done gives me freedom to do my office work while having a coffee.
"Extraordinary App for Business beyond traditional desktop. Quickbooks rules a new dimension on simplified business processes. 
It is a great App well synchronized with online services, so you can manage different critical aspects of your business on the way and connected. Its interface reflects trust, flexibility and fluidity."
Great but........ I love the app but it could use a bit more integration. For instance, you can AirPrint an invoice but you can't AirPrint a paid invoice. Seems like an oversight.
Deposits take too long. Overall the app is convenient for clients to pay me, but it takes entirely too long for deposits to be posted to my account.
Is an average app. Is a good app but with all these update is confusing my customers and sometimes they can't pay online. I can't access it from my phone. It's in and off so be warned!!
Great app. Very happy we use if for all our companies and recommend to our clients
Notes Problem. Customer notes in mobile app do NOT sync to customer notes in web version.
"Constant Program updates full of bugs. QB - I'd give 0 stars if I could.  Over the past 1-2 years Intuit has apparently decided to hire lots of useless programmers to write updates.  My online reports don't run correctly too often suddenly.  I get constant error messages.  Program freezes are now suddenly common.  Even things like the running totals in my registers disappeared in one of the late updates.  Why QB?! Why?!

Suddenly my transaction order in my registers got reversed, supposedly because that is how bank statements show it that way.  Though not my bank.  Thanks for nothing QB!

Suddenly instead of just logging in with my userid and pword, QB has decided that I additionally need an emailed access code now to log in each time.  Why?!  I already enter an id and password to log into my computer, and another to get into QB, and now yet ANOTHER by email or text just to log in to QB.  Why?!  Why?!

This is an AWFUL accounting program.  I'm a cpa and know how to evaluate an accounting program.  I quit recommending QB to clients.  And anyone in the market for accounting software should NOT buy this awful program."
No Purchase Orders. For years now QuickBooks has withheld the ability to create Purchase Orders through the mobile app. This is a huge issue for our company and it is quite frustrating that QB has willfully omitted this feature. I wish there was a way to convince QB to change course on this decision...
Needs a calendar interface. Great app, a clickable calendar link would make it more user friendly. Also needs the ability to edit notes on products and services.
Took a while to get used to. I used the web version for 2 years before attempting the mobile app. I was confused at first because the first screen is of the company's Recent Transactions, which I rarely use. A much more Intuitive home-screen would be a mobile version of the company's snapshot, just like the web version. Other than that, a pretty good app to complement the web version.
Super & excellent apps. Very user friendly application . I would recommend this software to other people
Still needs some changes. Multiple addresses for a company is still a drama as it changes all previous invoices and quotes. Plus iPad app continually won't save edited quotes. Have to use desktop version to edit invoices or quotes successfully. Annoying!
Works great for me!. This app is very convenient and easy to use. My business is not complex so it handles all of my needs quite nicely.
Love it, but. I love the app, but different devices have different functions. Some things I have to do on the laptop. The internet version will crash and I have to reload it. Not sure if its my internet connection or not. It is helping me get more organized and ready for 04/15/16,  UGH!
Great small business app. I've been using it for a year and it has made my life so much easier.  Customers can pay progressively.  I log on 20-30x a day for inputting expenses, billing customers, creating quick estimates and I have never had it not work for me. Although it is very expensive combined with quickePay (quickens version of the square reader)
Great invoicing app. Works great for invoicing needs.
👌🏼. Not a bad app
"Quickbooks On-line has many software issues. As a decade long Quickbooks user.  We upgraded to the Quickbooks + nearly as soon as it was released.  This option allowed for mobile device support.  Worked great.  Then with a 30day noticed we were switched to QBO and this app.

This is where our love affaire with Quickbooks ended.  

The program has give us hundreds of hours of lost productivity, spent on the phone following red dot with tech support only to be told ""this issue needs to be upgraded to programming"" or something of the sort.  System will go offline making all your information unavailable during the day.  New and constant programming issues with nearly every update.  Issues have cost us thousands with our CPA trying to resolve issues caused by QBO.  BTW- Our CPA firm says the same, QBO is a problem for many of their clients, resulting in a lot more billing hours for them.  Bank account suddenly stop syncing, sometimes for days or weeks at a time.  Credit cards will process, but not register to banking at time, throwing off banking balances.  Extremely limited on invoice or estimate layouts and designs.  In ability to customize fields.  First time we tried to print a check register in reverse order, program reversed the order on who the checks where written to, but not the amounts, so nothing corresponded.  Another programming issue.  

For over a decade we encouraged fellow businesses to use Quickbooks.  With QBO, we highly discourage this unless you prefer spending hundreds of hours trying to correct QBO related and caused issues."
Really helpful!!. I am a computer engineer and being able to make estimates and invoices in the field has really helped me!
Great app. Easy to use for on the go business. Wish it had check printing feature.  Please add that.
Great app for managing your accounts.. Great app, would definitely recommend it.
Lacks some functionality. My biggest problem is the app does a poor job of reconciling obviously matching expenses.
"Love it!. Quick books merging your gmail contacts and being able to add and subtract expenses 
lays your invoices out really well and makes everything so easy! Clients get all the information this way and it leaves them without surprises. Because of the convenience it forces me and reminds me to enter all the information that I would otherwise forget to include."
"Very Nice!. I love have this power in my phone! I can email invoices or print them out, ALL on my phone! 
This app is Easy to learn and soooooo fast when you get used to it. There was A Lot of thinking when they designed this app, WOW"
Don't waste your time and money .. Really waste of time to have it since its down at least once a week , not only that it does take few HOURS to back working and good luck talking to a live customer service also .on few occasions I couldn't issue invoices since its always saying that it's not connected to the Internet and or can not save invoices at that moment . They really need to work on better version before they start charging people money for a bad service .
Should do More. I'd give a zero stars if that was an option. People have complained for years this should do more AND IT SHOULD. To limited and basic. Like create auto billing directly from a current issue and not have to make a template and set it up should be simple right in an invoice. Needs to be able to hide estimates from employees yet merge all into a master (owner) account. Employees who use this for estimates should not see all transactions and expenses! This is a joke and extremely limited and yes I have used it for a year and read how long people ask for this stuff. Change and email anywhere and it should change it everywhere else but it doesn't you have to go back to original creation and edit it. Not easy for deposits and partial payments. The list goes on and one. Very generic but still likely better than the alternatives. But if I ran my business to never improve and listen to my customers I'd be out of business not them just another corporate conglomerate making money on the small folk yet won't fix what we need to run our business. Could be done so easily.
Awesome app. Feature rich and also user friendly
The best. Buy an iPad. Shred up your paper estimates/invoicing. Stop using pens. Download this app. Holy crap I've been in business 4 years and feel stupid after downloading this. Plus u look awesome w an iPad. Plus everything's stored forever.
App crashes. This app crashes or cannot save my data on every entry I make.  Horrible app!!
App. Best app
"Quickbooks Online. QBOL is totally different from the standard desktop version of QB.  I like some of the features such as directly updating my accounts by getting the latest transactions directly from my bank and from PayPal.  But there were a lot of mess ups due to me not knowing what QBOL was doing too. Thus many duplicate transactions.  I think I have a handle on it now (I say that every month).

The app for iPad works better that the desktop browser version for most of the common items, but some features just seem to be missing."
Great app, But!. This app has been great for my mobile business. Invoices and estimates look really nice. Like most mobile apps this one has many limitations. If you pay for an app you should get all the bells and whistles that you would get on a desktop or laptop computer. Hence the word mobile!
Good app.. It works good with my Ipad mini.
Works great for what I use it for. I run a simple personal business and this app has all I need!
"Unreliable. This app is buggy and slow.  Logging in is very hit or miss.  Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't for no apparent reason.
I have not been able to log in for a week.  All I get is an error message telling me to try again later.  Called support and I was told that they are working on it.  This app has been out for years, and there is no excuse for it being so unpredictable."
Quickbooks App. Last update is much better. Use for day to day operation and quick entries.
Intuit QuickBooks Review. For a PC Computer repair guy this app for the iPad is great. It is easily configurable to my situation. What it can't do on the iPad it can do online like in those rare occasions where I might need a report for my bookkeeper the online version covers it nicely, else the iPad for everyday transactions is excellent. I love how it prints to my iOS enabled printer remotely via AirPrint. It's very fast to use to get my invoices out quickly. It keeps track of who's paid and best of all my bookkeeper is happy with me using it.
They ruined this product. Run, don't walk, away from this app. The idiots at intuit have destroyed all utility in it.
Online version is a work in progress. New to quickbooks online. Easy to pick up. Issues with duplicate transactions. Laborious to shift in between screens frequently. Not ideal for basic businesses. No ability to make an account inactive without deleting all transactions. Home screen not useful. Mobile app not useful for credit card transactions.
Buggy. Obviously the desktop version is great. But, the portability of the online version makes it convenient. The mobile app is very buggy and very frustrating to use. For example when adding a payment to an invoice, once you click 'save', there is no way out but 'back' therefore the transaction looks like it was undone. But wait - it wasn't even though it still looks incomplete.  These types of issues and lack of updates to fix them make me angry when I then have to pay $26 a month for something I can't even use for the way it was intended - mobile.
Great app. First time business owner and have to say it's a great way to stay organized
Mr. Great app. I use it all the time on my phone and tablet.it works seamlessly with QBO. Invoicing, receipts, checking my account, giving it to my Bookeeper all easy and on the go. I couldn't do without it now.
"So much potential... so little delivered!!!. Such limited information available to users, can't even see a list of invoices due by customers or bills due to suppliers... I can look up their phone number and address but that's what I thought the contacts app was for...

Intuit, pull your finger out of your proverbial and actually write an app that does something... can't see expenses unless I enter them with my phone.  The iPad version is the same, no excuse for that, it's not like the screen isn't big enough or anything.

I'm sure a 12 year old with limited spending money could write and match this app for functionality.

Yep, I'm disappointed with this..."
"Only real option for online small business bookkeeping. Quickbooks on line is really the only workable online bookkeeping solution for small business.
It still needs a lot of work to make it worth what they charge for it.
Also be very careful when upgrading from one level to another. A very slick customer service rep had me upgrade to a level of service that cost twice what I was paying claiming that I would have a certain functionality that I needed.
In the end, not only did I not get what I needed, but I could not return to the basic level, unless I wanted to close out my account and loose all my data.
Still all this being said, as far as I can tell it is the best of what is being offered as a web based service."
"Not useable in multi-user environment. Yup, yet again another update, and still not useable in multi-user.  My business has more than 1 user account.  Locations and Classes do not work in their accounts.  How many years will this take to fix a bug that has been present since day 1?

Another update and I stand behind my previous review(s).

Seriously? Another update, and still not multi-user friendly.  But, oh boy, something works with Apple Watch.  When will Intuit fix the multi-user issues?  Someone else mentions they fix bugs.  I can say the exact opposite - they leave bugs for years!

I want to use and like this app. I've looked at every update since the very 1st version.  It does seem to be slowly improving, but is still not useable for my company."
A1 app. I love this app ! I'm using it all day !
Excellent app for small business. Been using this app for 2 years and we have no complaints. Most efficient app for operating a small business. A+
Landscape company. I like this app as it helps me stay on top of the billing before I leave the site.  But the client care and billing is HORRIBLE CUSTOMER CARE IS THE WORST IN NORTH AMERICA.  STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY.  THEY BILL YOU WHEN THEY ARE NOT SUPPOSE TO.
Convenient. A very nice app that gives me power to monitor and control my company accounts anytime, anywhere.
Ridiculous omission. I can not believe that with all of the updates that you still can not create a purchase order with this app. Ridiculous.
Exactly what I need. The app combined with the online system does exactly what I need it to do. I can invoice clients as soon as I've left their premises, no more trying to keep a record and doing the paperwork later. Invoice matching and bank data feeds make reconciliation so easy. This has reduced the amount of time I spend on my accounts significantly. Goodbye Sage, hello QB online. Happy customer.
Online version Frustrating!. We have used various QB versions since 1999. The desktop versions were also difficult to startup, but eventually worked until we switched to the new and IMPROVED! Then we started over. The online version was to be an improvement we wished for due our service organization, and in the field invoicing. There were many glitches we tried to work around. Several issues we tried to work out with little success, we took to the Tech Service advisers.  Spelling out our primary problems and items we would like them to add. We were told that all our issues were valid and that they would keep a ticket open for us to see the progress, and that they would be in contact with us during the process. Well it died there. The ticket was closed later that same day, and we were never contacted. There advisers (in our experience) are quite useless.
Great App. I love quickbooks online as well as the mobile application for iPhone and iPad. I basically run my business from my tablet and smart phone. We truly are living in the future.
"Updates to features Needed. I am a subscriber. Sad to say that the phone and iPad apps are useless.
They do look pretty but have none of the functionality that is useful on the go or made me convert to quickbooks online in the first place: 1)You can't access bank data or enter transactions. 2)You can't record bills 3)you can't process the pay 4) you can't view invoices that have mileage or time put against them. 5) you can't enter timesheets.6) can't submit or edit tax data 7) no access to Chart of Accounts 8) can't see or edit employee data!

But you can access useless features that are just gimmicky: use your fingerprint to log in. View profit loss because that's where you do your deepest analysis, which frustrates even more because you can't alter anything.

Common guys get those features in and I'll alter this to 5 stars!"
"Best app ever. I am a tech on the go , and we made the switch from paper invoicing to quick books online.
I cannot tell you how much this app saves me on time and frustration , everything is there at the tip of your finger.
Thanks intuit for making my work that much easier!"
Awesome, but somewhat lacking. I'm an IT Professional who does commercial & residential repairs, contracts, services and sales in person and on my eBay store (I'm self employed and do all this from home) and the quickbooks online version is way easier and faster to use than the traditional computer installed version. Also, I didn't have to cough up $400-$600 for the desktop version (heavy program & used way too much memory) that will eventually be outdated. The desktop version had more options within the software, but the online version is more versatile if your utilizing multiple devices to run your business. As for me, I have a dedicated eBay room with iMac the dedicated tech/repair room with Mac Pro server, the main office AKA my office with iMac and I work from my iPads when I'm in the family area (I have a bluetooth keyboard and treat the iPads as if they were mini-iMacs and I can take signatures while out on a job-site and add receipts and pictures to estimates and invoices or the note section for each customer. If you have a regular wifi ipad like me, now with most companies like Verizon, I can turn on the personal hotspot for free and turn my iphone into a wifi hotspot for my ipad. Remember to turn off your personal hotspot when finished, otherwise it can continue to use your cellular data in the background. So, I utilize the flexibility of using the online version wherever I go. Its paperless and I can run my business literally from anywhere. Over-all I'm impressed and can work-cross platform or even from my phone if I'm out in the field working. HOWEVER The main features are lacking in the iPad and iPhone/Mac app versions. You have to use a regular computer internet browser such as explorer, chrome or safari to see and use every quickbooks online option available, but don't have access to those options in the iphone, ipad and mac app version. There are times when I'm working with my mac app version or ipad and then I have to enter new business or administrative detail like a new credit card or bank account or more specific details and then the options don't seem to be in the apps at all. Then I have to switch to the internet browser or go to a computer with browser in order to view some of the options I need to complete my task. Kind of disrupts the flow, plus doesn't give 100% full access to all features with the apps, but is very close. Every update it seems they add a lacking feature to the apps so, hopefully they keep adding until the online version AND APPS are full and complete. Got 4 stars for overall versatility and convenience. Didn't get the 5th star due to lack of features in the app version which makes me have to always use or switch to the browser. Inconvenient when I'm out on a Job utilizing my mobile devices then I have to dread finishing up loose ends on the computer when I get home. Also, I would rather use the app because of its quick response and interface, because the internet browser always seems to be clunky and use more computer memory. My suggestion to any Quickbooks rep reading this is to CONCENTRATE ON THE APPS and let the browser be the backup option.
Easy to use. No experience needed. You can perform 95% of what you can do on the computer on this app.. The only things you cannot do include things like personalizing invoice colors and options, and I had trouble sending a single invoice to two recipients.. I was able to do both successfully on the computer but not the app.
"Would like to like it better. I personally like the iPad app better than the online version for interface, but it has so many bugs!  Constantly gives me error message that I'm not authorized to do something (add/edit a customer, etc.), but then it lets me do it.  But I keep having to close out all the error messages that pop up.  Often won't let me email an invoice.  Won't let me add customer off of creating a new estimate (have to add customer, close, then do estimate and choose customer again).  The list of basic things that should not be an issue goes on and on.  On the iPhone app, there is no place for my reps to view the contact person's name at the company!  I'm sure there are other things I could think of, but I've just learned to compensate and work around things.  However an app with this many bugs should not be out there - it's pretty pathetic!

UPDATE 11/18/15 - after update, all the previous bugs are still there.  Pathetic to issue an update and not fix what was wrong!"
Rave. I have enjoyed having customer information at my fingertips on this app.
"Brilliant!!!!. Works like a dream with QB online. I can finish a job and then send the invoice from my phone (whilst sitting at home drinking a cuppa!). Just include ""totals"" for estimates and sales invoices please!"
"No Support - Update. Update: last year the screwed up my account just before tax time, see below. Now with the latest update I am once again being told my subscription does not exist even though I paid for the whole year. And once again, I am unable to access critical features or anything useful in the app just before tax time. I begin to think this is a scam.

Previous: I loved this app until there was an issue with my subscription. I was locked out of the app when the payment processed a weekend late. Intuit says Apple has to fix it. Apple says Intuit has to fix it. Intuit says they will contact Apple then contact me, the sound of crickets rings through the house. It has been almost a month, no one has fixed it. Meanwhile, I have no way to modify invoices, update my budget, bill, or track sales because the app asks me to subscribe in order to do anything but login. When i push the check subscription button, it confirms that I have one then logs me out and the dance begins again. Best part: Apple won't refund the subscription for the month only stop it for next month and Intuit says they cannot refund anything, so I am paying them to be locked out. This is no way to run a business. No way to retain consumer confidence. And after the New Year I will be using something else. It is a great app, until it breaks."
"So frustrating. ""Updated"" the app... Telling me now that I need a new version of the app and since I already have it, not sure what I'm supposed to do.

Even my accountant agrees Quickbooks Online is too confusing. Waiting for 2016 to close out my books and use a new program."
Great invoicing app. Work great for invoicing needs.
What happened?. This app used to work perfectly. After the last update I can't use it how I used too. If they do not fix it soon I am going to have to look into other options
Great app. I'm a new business owner and I couldn't have been successful without this app!!
Awful. iPhone app pretty much unusable in the real world.  Always wants to be signed in each time you open it, Touch ID feature doesn't work.  Today it's complaining the app needs to be updated before I use it, it then directs me to the App Store where it shows I already have the latest version!
App not working - version 4.3.3. App not able to connect. Consistently showing ‘Temporary Unavailable'
Quickbooks online app A+. App is very easy to use, even people without lots of knowledge in bookkeeping can manage their small business with quickbooks online through the app.
PLEASE: GIVE US DELAYED CHARGE. FOR THE LOVE OF GAWD, WHY CAN I NOT ADD A DELAYED CHARGE ON THE MOBILE APP??????  This is something you actually WANT to do when you're at a client, not get them to sign for an invoice every time you visit them during the month.
"Amazing for Bussiness. This App is the best thing a small Bussiness owner can have 
Two thumbs up and five stars"
Great. Makes invoices and estimates from phone look right professional. I use the desktop version as well and it would be great if the different versions spoke to each otherwise best solution by far
"Needs more functions. Not a bad app but is lacking better search modes. There needs to be a way to look up customers by address or phone numbers. 
Also, many of our customers have multiple rentals, buildings, apartments etc. There isn't anyway to keep these addresses under the same customer.  I have to look at each and every invoice to find the address in the memo section. 
I don't like having to start the search all over again when I have looked up a customer with the same last name and it's not the correct one."
"Disappointed.... I had high expectations for this App., but it just doesn't deliver. Half the features advertised return a message ""feature not supported at this time, please log on from a computer""! So what's the point? Why not just not release the App until it works? Looking for another option."
Hi. App don't work
It's good enough. This a good app helps out when in the road.
Lacking several important fixes. Initially the app was incredible... Unfortunately after an update on my iPad, the ability to email my invoices got much more difficult, no longer populates my contacts, have to manually enter every time, it doesn't store or remember emails. I get connection lost or you are not connected to the Internet error messages constantly. Spoken with customer care who said I should enter them manually.... REALLY? Thousands of email addresses, maybe you should fix your glitches!
Life saver. I would not know what to do without this app! Yeah I would have to fight through receipts every month to balance month end report. With the app I just input the info when I make the purchase and it makes it so much easier. Recommend the app 110%.
Almost there!!. Please, please, please QB🙏🏼 you're a few key functions away from making this app the mobile office.
Great app. Great for on the go owners.
Great app.. Wonderful!
Good app. Easy to use
"Confusing and Cluttered App. I love that nearly all of the features in the desktop app are here in the mobile app. However the interface, especially the home page, is confusing and cluttered. ""Company Activity"" is a bit useless as the default page. Show me the charts of paid/unpaid invoices. 

I think the developers are tasked with including every single feature and that clouds their design judgement. It's not an easy ask but let's make this app more mobile friendly."
Very happy with app. The app is very good, and provides a lot of useful information that can be sent anytime, anywhere.
Ok but needs work. We have 4 ipad2 running his app to invoice and do estimates on the go. We do field service but often gave problems whether server related or just speed/connection issues. This app is overall ok but need work. AN OFFLINE MODE WOULD BE GREAT! It is very very slow at saving images or signatures and sending emails with documents to customers. Often I have had to stop and reset the app to save a signature and many times I end up writing it up because of the issues. Good luck with it.
"Great app. I don't understand what some people are complaining about it. This app works great. 
Thank you"
"Quickbooks Web is Perfect, but App still needs improvements. I have subscribed quickbooks essentials over web. The web version is perfect. It has all the key elements that ideally any accounting system should have. Moreover it has very nice and easy to use interface which makes data-entry experience wonderful. 

However the mobile app on the other hand needs some improvements. Although you can do most of the transactions through your mobile but certain things are missing;

1- Creating sales receipts it saves the transaction but the amount goes in undeposited funds and there is no facility to transfer those funds to your bank account

2- Reports are missing. I cannot view any report from the mobile app except for profit and loss report. Even a bank statement is not available"
Love😻this app. Must have for small business owners.. Or even for personal use. Don't know what I'd do with out it. Been using for 3 years now😊
Love it.  Done right.  Password defeats purpose of Touch ID and Apple Watch. Finances done right.  Only quirk is the need to type password fairly regularly, plus only prompted Touch ID some of the time.  Apple Watch app often wants me to log in on phone first.
"Nice, But Not As Good As It Could Be. Great for staying on top of purchases. But, it's too cumbersome to move around within the app efficiently.  
  Needs to have the ability to post deposits and merchandise returns/credits from within the app."
Essential Tool. This app is the greatest tool for invoicing.
Don't count on it being 100% reliable!. Have been using this program for a couple years. In the begging, it was great (for the most part).  Lately it's been denying my employees and self access, giving me a variety of errors. After spending over an hour with customer service, the conclusion is - their version of the software doesn't function with each and every iOS update. My company sells fresh truffles to hotels, restaurants, resorts, etc... And so, we weigh the truffles on-site, create their invoice while we're in the kitchen and MUST collect a digital signature (through the app itself) to ensure their accounting department will take accountability and pay us in a timely manner. Aside from Truffles being the most expensive food on the planet, they're also the most perishable (90%+ water, which means they/I lose weight/MONEY each hour I sit on them)!  So, beyond not being able to deliver my product in a timely manner, as requested by our customers, we've been forced to SIT on our product and not be able to sell until they fix the problem. All in all, we've probably lost AT LEAST $500-1000 from money literally evaporating into thin air, thanks in large to Quickbooks! Let alone the embarrassment of having to tell our customers we have their product but can't sell it to them.  Not saying the app/software is bad, just don't count on being able to rely on it like we have. Caveat Emptor :(
Owner. Love the app. Makes running my business so easy. I would give it five stars except once I was using the app and the system was down for little while. Made me feel a little uneasy
"A pretty good app. All in all, this is a pretty great app. It does just about everything I need it to while on the go, but it is missing one key piece of functionality. It does not allow the recording of deposits and that is really important for me. 
Other than that it functions flawlessly and has never given me any trouble. Overall, I love it!"
Not bad. App is good. Qb online is lacking.
App not working. All how I enter the correct username and password it is say that I am unable to sign in please try again later. However the app works fine on my android. Is there a problem with the iOS version of this app
Can't login in app. Why can't login in app?!
No customer support. This is potentially a great app, but customer support is non-existent - 3 emails sent and 2 weeks waiting for a reply to a subscription issue.
Love it.  Done right.. Finances done right.  Only quirk is the need to type password fairly regularly, plus only prompted Touch ID some of the time.  Apple Watch app often wants me to log in on phone first.
Great app. I use Apple products and it works great for us. Get paid quick with credit cards or bank transfers.
CrapApp. Quickbooks program is nice though the company's blatant lack of interest in the osx platform baffles me... This app is basically worthless and does not update to changes made online FOUR weeks ago... They have light years to go before this app is worthy of being used...
Seems fine. I have a small business, so this app does what I need it to. May I suggest adding a minus button in the number keyboard area that pops up when you add a product price in the invoice? I like to show a discount amount and it's not possible without the - key.
App crashes. This app crashes or cannot save my data on every entry I make.  Horrible app!!
Permissions issues. I would rate 4 stars if the app permissions were accurate. Whenever adding a note or signature to an invoice I'm informed I don't have permission to make that change, however I do have permission to make the changes and the changes are reflected in the invoice/estimate.
Limited. Desktop app for Mac is brutal slow. Mobile apps ok but limited graphic reports
User. Good app but needs more features
Great app. So easy a caveman can do it
Beautifully done. I have recently made the switch from Quickbooks desktop to Quickbooks online and this app gives me more than I could ever need when I am out meeting with clients!
Great app. Just started to use. Easy to navigate. Have had no issues.
Barely useable. It's a great idea, but too many features of the online version are not accessible on the app. Perhaps the QB folks are working on upgrades
Can't wait for more!. Yeah, it's not going to be the only way you use Quickbooks. But having the opportunity to have a mobile capability is immensely helpful. It's how you use it and when to that makes this app great!
Super & excellent apps. Very user friendly application . I would recommend this software to other people
Great App. I compared couple of similar products and Quickbooks was defiantly the best. I still believe that they could enhance their app to have identical features of their web version.
Great App. Need to be able to make statements from iPhone. Just make the app able to do everything you're able to do from laptop. Love quikbooks.
Very good for any kind of business!. Quickbooks is great app for managing the everyday finances. It's very fast to send invoices, with this app all income and expenses are simple and quick.
Could use improvements. Really like this app! However, it won't even add my phone number or business address on my invoices, so I add it in the message section.  QB creators, please test run every possible business need.  I've already done business via this app, so I can't afford not to have it at full & complete capacity!  Please!  Make me love it!  I want my partners to use it too!
I am truly Loving this app. Been hunting for a simple app for managing the finances of my farm business. This helps me with capturing and analysis of all my expenses and income. The reporting is also amazing. I also love the fact that I can even get more stats and reports via the web. Amazing stuff. Already introduced it to quite a number of industry colleagues. Truly an amazing app
President. This app is great for small (mobile) business owners doing paperwork on the fly. It keeps office time to a minimum.
"Ok, but should have more features. It seems like this app has been stagnate for a while, were are the updates ?
You think that intuit would have pushed this app further along as far as functionality.
Just the fact I can't search for line items or notes, makes me wonder about the integrity of app, surely if it's web based like the online version, then make those features available to !!!!
There will be a better app out there someday, and hopefully Intuit will wake up and smell the coffee !!!"
Best invoice app. Easy to use quickly paid
Works great. Really like the functionality of the app.  Having it available no matter what device I want to use is a real time saver.
Functional but could be better. I use the app on my iPhone and iPad to keep on top of my business books. The app is great for simple things and entering everyday expenses, but I still can't enter time activity from my phone and when I have an invoice with billable time and materials, the app won't even open it. So I have to use the mobile browser which is a pain. I've had to setup a remote connection to an actual desktop browser so that I can do somethings that the mobile browser and the app just won't do because the features aren't developed. It would be nice if some focus would go to making all access points equal. If I could do everything in the app that I can do from the desktop browser, then I think that we'd be in business.
Very good for business!. Quickbooks is a great app for managing the everyday finances for my business that I just start. No matter what is a small business, this is the right one.
Missing Features. It would great if it could read data from receipts and auto fills the fields.  I can't get my clients to use the app, because re silt entry is too cumbersome.  Reports are lacking.
"Love the convenience. Love the app, but please add an option for ""inclusive tax"". So easy to build and send invoices, post payments, create estimates, etc....."
Exelent app. Recomended. Exelent app. Recomended
Love it!. I love quickbooks online and I love this app!
Much better than the desk top version. I really like this app as opposed to the old desktop version. I'm sure there are updates that could make it better, but I'm satisfied with how it works for me.
"A long way to go. Basic but does the job 
Not the best app"
"missing key functions. Unless I am daft and can't see it, there is no option to add a bill.  I just want to add a bill from a supplier to the company. Adding an expense won't cut it, because some of the bills are not due upon receipt. 
I don't see the chart of accounts.
I don't see the ability to pull up the supplier history to pay the bill or simply check up on the account. 
If these functions are available, they are not easily found, therefore making this app not very user friendly 

These are not super advanced needs.  These are pretty basic functions that are not available on this app."
Great app, continues to get better. Best decision I ever made for my business was moving to QB Online. Saves a ton of time being able to conduct business on the fly.
Excellent app. Keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
QuickBooks online app. Very simple use, efficient and stable. I have no complaints!
Great & Up-to-date!. This is a great little app to give you access into the back end of your QuickBooks online account. Great for doing simple invoicing and adding expenses. I still use the desktop browser for more complicated reports and such. Well done and Intuit keeps the app up to date thank you!
"Fantastic features. All the features that works under this single app. I used to work with excel spreadsheet, invoice app, expense app to complete the business on the go. 
Now everything has being simplify into this one subscription saving me time and double entry. I am absolutely happy that I can email invoice, take pictures and enter expense using my iPhone. Best of all these is update into the cloud.
Great excellent accounting software nothing comes close after trying others accounting software."
"Great but behind the times. Need more options. This is the best mobile document APP I have found but needs more options such as attaching pictures, need options for the different ways different businesses need to enter and file information. You can't change a invoice to a estimate if accidental option is selected. Contractors have investor customers with multiple job site addresses but no way to separate on this APP and before and after pictures option to attache to invoice would be helpful. Vendors with various merchandise need ways to keep track of items NOT customers. ""Antique""  Dealers need a fast way to keep track of items with pictures of item and tag attached with item number and description."
Perfect. I can't speak for large business but for a small business like mine this app is almost perfect.  The only thing I need added is a milage manager for vehicle use. I love it, my tax guy loves it, what else could you ask for.
Excellent tool for my biz. Since I got this app on my phone I hardly need to go to the office, or open my laptop. Love it!
Would like to like it better. I personally like the iPad app better than the online version for interface, but it has so many bugs!  Constantly gives me error message that I'm not authorized to do something (add/edit a customer, etc.), but then it lets me do it.  But I keep having to close out all the error messages that pop up.  Often won't let me email an invoice.  Won't let me add customer off of creating a new estimate (have to add customer, close, then do estimate and choose customer again).  The list of basic things that should not be an issue goes on and on.  On the iPhone app, there is no place for my reps to view the contact person's name at the company!  I'm sure there are other things I could think of, but I've just learned to compensate and work around things.  However an app with this many bugs should not be out there - it's pretty pathetic!
Great app. User friendly for billing and collecting payments. Also help with keeping up with customers invoice balance!
Many tech issues - Poor customer support. After weeks of connecting to my bank account and importing my transactions automatically, the app decided to stop doing that. Customer service was not helpful. Also the reporting capabilities and graphics are very limited.
"Works exactly as accounting software should. I installed QB with some trepidation. I was sceptical as I have been of invoicing software in the past. They've usually promised a lot, but delivered very differently in real world situations. 

However from the time I installed QB, it's worked brilliantly for me. The ability to customise various accounting heads, the intuitiveness and simplicity, yet power of the mobile iPad app has been a revelation. 

We're in the first fiscal year of using this software and converting from our manual accounting methods, but so far with us being in the third quarter of the fiscal, the software, reports and everything about the software has worked as it should! 

It has taken the pain out of manual accounting and manual report generation entirely! 

Get your accounting systems up and running on QB. You won't regret it!"
Improving. Each new version a little better than the last. Just like QB Online for Mac App, both need more features to compete with the rest of the QB product line. Still has a long way to go.
Great App!. Very user-friendly and convenient. Great for people who are needing to create invoices and estimates and track expenses. The iPhone app is fantastic!
"Very Nice!. I love have this power in my phone! I can email invoices or print them out, ALL on my phone! 
This app is Easy to learn and soooooo fast when you get used to it. There was A Lot of thinking when they designed this app, WOW"
"Great App. It's good to use this to add pics of receipts to your account while you work on the Mac. 
I have been waiting for this for such a long time. I needed something to replace the outdated ATO's E-record."
Very handy.. Great app for when I'm away from my pc and need to sort invoice or sort my accounts.
Growing apps. Always getting better and better
Great. Great app I use it everyday, makes invoices a breeze and makes it easier at the end of the year for tax purposes.
Like it better than the PC version. Easy to use, categorize expenses, and use. It's actually easier to use than the full version on a laptop browser.
Game changer. This has been a fantastic app. Having the ability to access our estimating and billing from any devise has been great !
"Some critical shortfalls. There are many great parts to QuickBooks online and the app, however some of the shortfalls are not worth it. 
- cannot invoice a % of an invoice, it's all or nothing
- USD clients do not show up on the app
- if an estimate is changed, there is no record of the change and the older versions are gone
- does not allow for a templated terms and conditions on invoices or estimates, you have to copy paste into the memo section, which has very limited space"
"Dissapointing. Used to love this ap. but it has been garbage for some time now. Takes forever to login and load on my iPhone (even slower on my iPad). Once you are finally in adding new customers or saving estimates is just as bad. Have called customer support to find out what is going on and received the response ""we know about the issue and we are working on it"". This was over two months ago. I was added to their escalation list and have yet to receive an update. Horrible customer service. Actively looking for a different direction for our business."
3 stars. Doesn't do everything I would like it to do but overall pleased with this app.
"Perfect App ,but not!!. This could have been a perfect app if it allowed two important features.

1) Ability to add supplier bills 
2) Ability to add attachments while emailing estimates."
The best app ever. Now we can run our business with this app.Very convenient and easy to use.
"Getting better all the time. Still needs tweaking.. I use this app for my business every day, and the mobility is excellent. Saves so much time in paperwork.

I am waiting for a couple of fixes in the iPhone version.

1. There is no way to change whether a discount is before or after tax as in the desktop and iPad versions (it's locked to discount after tax and to change it requires logging in on another device to make the change).

2. I'd love to see a couple more report options, particularly Invoices by Month as on the iPad version.

Other than having to log in on another device for these things, it's solid and I'd encourage anyone in a similar business (service industry) to use this app."
"Not useable in multi-user environment. Yup, yet again another update, and still not useable in multi-user.  How many years will this take to fix a bug since day 1?

Another update and I stand behind my previous review(s).

Seriously? Another update, and still not multi-user friendly.  But, oh boy, something works with Apple Watch.  When will Intuit fix the multi-user issues?  Someone else mentions they fix bugs.  I can say the exact opposite - they leave bugs for years!

I want to use and like this app. I've looked at every update since the very 1st version.  It does seem to be slowly improving, but is still not useable.
My business has more than 1 user account.
Locations and Classes do not work in their accounts.  Not in any sales forms.  Not in expenses.
When my other users go to Customers, they see total sales for the last 90 days.  They do not need to, nor should they see this.
If I cant't have my employees use this app, it is useless!"
Quick book User. Amazing app ever
Could be better. Does not perform the same on my phone/tablet as my desktop.  I.e automated emails on my desktop autofill my clients name, my phone does not.  On my desktop I can switch the order of items on my invoices and estimates, on my phone I cannot. The simple editing features are extremely important on a device that smaller than my hand.
"Brilliant App. Quickbooks is an amazing App. I'm an electrician with a small business, so I need something quick and easy when I'm in the field.
Entering expenses and creating invoices is so easy on my tablet and/or phone saving me hours per week. 
Great work...I'm very impressed!"
High hopes cause big fails. The app crashes all of the time. No integration with desktop versions but ok. I though I would have something on the go for small invoices. I can't get through the first invoice. All progress gets lost with the crashes. I love how much time I save with the desktop version. There customer service has always been terrible. They can't even have a fully working version for the trial period. Fail!
"Poor customer support. In general the service is good UNLESS you need help ,almost no response from customer service , payroll service is poor .no follow up ,nothing 
Invoice on IPad doesn't accept the customer signature anymore on IOS 9 ,no update to be found either no phone number ,end of year will be a good time to switch provider"
Signature issues. The app crashes every time I get a signature or it doesn't save the signature. Please resolve this issue. It has now been a week and this is still an issue.
Excelente app. Intuit ha hecho un excelente trabajo de poner a la mano literalmente los libros de contabilidad de la práctica y de los clientes. Totalmente funcional y fácil de usar.
"Great little app. Excellent app for basic book keeping invoicing  etc and keep up with the book keeping on the fly.
But to do the serious stuff you still need to work from a laptop or desktop."
"iPad perfect until iOS 8.5. App hasn't worked since 8.5 update. Have sent several request about the app crashing and no one has gotten back to me. I've deleted and redone loaded, rebooted iPad, etc.
When not crashing it's a 5 star app. Please fix asap!"
Owner. Love this app work great.
Fantastic app for a superb product!!. I've been using Quickbooks since I began my private voice and piano studio. I am able to easily track invoices and payments and send reminders to my students and their parents. The app has helped me save time when adding payments so I can focus my time on my students. I also love how I can send receipts and reminder invoices even when I am on the run! Definitely a 5 star product & app!
IOS 9. With the new OS signatures on the iPhone are no longer saved to invoices, instead the app just crashes.  When people become dependent on specific features and then they stop working it leads to a lot of extra work. Please fix this feature ASAP.
"iOS 9 broke it. iOS 9 broke the app and now every time it's trying to download company data just crashes. Uninstalled and reinstalled. 

Also wish you could accept transactions on this."
Incompatible with iOS 9. This app is great in iOS 8 and even supports Touch ID. However, it does not work in iOS 9 and needs an immediate update.
Unprepared and Unknowledgable. As an app developer myself, I'm thrilled with the desktop experience however I was looking forward to using the mobile benefits of this app and have yet to be able to. iOS9 and this app are NOT compatible and the app crashes when downloading company data. I understand ios9 is new but it has been out to developers (like intuit) for months and they were still not prepared. Customer support then has no information on when it will be updated and claimed there is no known issue. Very disappointed and losing trust by the day.
Signature issues. The app crashes every time I get a signature or it doesn't save the signature. Please resolve this issue
Frustrated. After doing the IOS 9 update whenever I go into this app after I sign in and try to do any task it completely boots me out of the app!! I am assuming it has something to do with the IOS 9 update but it is very frustrating. I don't believe it has anything to do with the tablet because every other app is working fine. I have plenty of storage to support the app 111gb available. It worked fine before the update. I have done a hard reset a few times. I have deleted the app and reload it. Still no success. This is very frustrating and this app is very important for my job. I sincerely hope this gets fixed very soon!!!!!
Great app that scratch. Is freezing and scratching often
"Pretty good. Although the online version of QB leaves quite a lot to be desired (having used the desktop version for 15 years, the so-called all singing and dancing online version is still clearly a Beta version!)
But this is very handy when I'm on the move, although I don't understand why the fingerprint access works only part of the time, i.e. I logged in (with password), used the app for some minutes, then answered the phone, only to have to log back in with password again within 2 minutes, yet yesterday, having not used the app for several days it was happy for my fingerprint! Inconsistent!?
Does have useful map facility and shows clients addresses, nearest to furthest away if planing a day in the road!"
"Difficult to use at best!. WOW talk about a over complicated software!! I have a small business and all I want to do is track deposits, expenses, and tax info. Well good luck, the platform is different on all devices, try and find a very simple ""deposit"" button. After digging I have but why did I have to dig? Still can't find it on my iPad. I am going to keep playing with it until the free trial is over, but I don't think I am going to stick with it."
Excellent app. Helpful reports and nice review of recent transactions to make sure operations are in tact.
IOS 9 crashes. crashes on iOS 9.  spent over an hour on the phone with tech support! their solution to the app not working on iOS 9. downgrade to iOS 8.  what a joke! they said there are no known issues with iOS 9 then in the same sentence, there's an update coming at the end of the end of the month! I'm beginning to question the security of my companies info in the hands of a company that openly lies about compatibility just to make a sale! peach tree is looking like a more trustworthy solution.
Not working on iOS 9. Hopefully you all are seeing the crash logs, but after I login to the app it crashes when downloading my company data.
Ok. App ok
Crashing after iOS 9 update. App continues to crash after updating to iOS 9. Just after opening it crashes. This app has been an excellent tool to my business. Looking forward to a quick bug fix.
Works great. Good app. Works great on the road for creating fast invoices on site.  Great companion app for quick books am dos fully functional.
New update changed invoices. The app shuts down every time I get a signature!!
"Crashes w/ iOS 9. App crashes after you enter password. 
Intuit has had 3 months to test on beta. Customer service has no idea what iOS 9 is."
"Ok but could be better. I'm hoping the developers read this I use this app about 5-15 times a day for receipts for my customers I have 2 complaints about it and hope they fix them 
1 the app continuously says it's not connected to the internet so it can't save customers or transactions when the rest of the phone connects just fine 
2 the app logs itself out and you continuously have to log in again and it's supper annoying as sometimes it takes forever why can't it just stay logged in till you log out like this should be a no brainer"
Keeps crashing since update.. App is pretty good, unusable with crashes since the new iOS came out.
Great app for business. Love this app. Great for my work as I'm mobile 90% of the time. Certain features that I can't access on the app easily than on the desktop.
Intuit Provides Poor Service. One would think a powerhouse like intuit would provide at least an acceptable level of service, however the service from Intuit and this QuickBooks online division is in my opinion very poor. Most Intuit services I have use have outdated software and poor customer service, so it runs across the entire company as it seems. The other option is Xero and I've heard some good things about this though I've never used it. In addition to the poor customer service, I probably run into at least one software issue a month and calling them on that issue is a pain because they do a good job hiding their phone number. I would have rather posted a positive review and have had great customer service and great software, however while the software is functionable, everything around it is not so great.
Great app. Very good photo function. So, no need to save receipt.
Great app!. Very user-friendly and easy to use!
Great for billing while traveling. This app is very hearty.   I was worried how it would work from the iPad but it was so easy.   Let's me bill while I'm on the road so that I can keep my cash flow in order.   Great job, Inuit!
Love but.... great! Except would love to be able to make a deposit with the app
Upholstery shop. Very good app, help me a lot at upholstery business!
Essential for my small biz. Very useful app. Does have some annoying issues ( crashes,signs out often, etc) but overall great app.
A+. Awesome app. This makes my life so much simpler! Super easy to use. 5 stars from this guy!
Missing basic function. The inability to create deposits is a huge flaw with this app. Quickbooks defaults to receiving payments to Undeposited Funds - you would think that they'd remember that when creating an app.
App is satisfactory - Quickbooks Online is not. I am very unhappy with QuickBooks online. If you are anything more then a landlord of one rental property, then you will find QuickBooks online to be greatly underwhelming.  It is clunky, glitchy, and virtually void of any mechanism for customizing the program.  It is not a replacement for Quickbooks Desktop.  Perhaps after a few years of unfortunate beta testers abandoning Quickbooks Online it will get better.  For now, though, don't do it.
Great app. 👍🏼
Best accounting app I've used. This makes my business run smooth and conveniently, I hope they bring more functionality to it still.
Small Business. The use of quick books has helped me in my invoicing and tracking of my expenses. I have learned to apply the app to my work. Waking away with a signature and sending the invoice on the costumers  dime is nice.
Great app. Keeps me up to date with my rental properties. I always know where the finances are. Makes the end of the month so quick and easy to finalize. It's fun.
No multi currency in app. There is no multi currency function in the ipad app making it useless for entering overseas travel expenses.
Quickbooks is genius. I don't normally write reviews for apps. But quickbooks online is simply A-M-A-ZING. I've been using it for over a year and I absolutely love it. I can download transactions from the bank so no boring data entry and can create invoices on the go on my phone. So good.
"Somewhat useful, but UI stinks. If you're using this app in conjunction with the desktop version, you're best bet is to bring your laptop rather than you're iPad while you're on the go. 

The UI totally stinks, looks and feels NOTHING like what you're used to. 

My expectation was that I could replace the laptop while on the go and use the iPad app, needless to say I carry both because this app stinks."
"Great for my simple business. I love quickbooks online and would give it 5 stars except I send many estimates, invoices and sales receipts by email and frequently they are not received and unless I follow up I do not know they were not received. When it is sent I need the satisfaction it will be received. 

Again I love the program."
"It's scam don't download 19.99 per month they took from my account. I just did download almost 8 month ago this app they took from my account almost 19.99 per month after cancel also they are robbing very bad don't download at all even no customer service to help you to talk also 
Bad bad super bad"
Great app, here's my issue. I'm on the go with my business. I use quick books on my iPhone and my iPad mini. It's great in the field, quick and easy to use with ZERO crashes. I pull up everything I need EXCEPT I cannot go online from my phone or tablet and update my cc information. My card expired and since I don't have a computer I'm stuck having to call and get help for an easy fix. I really hope you guys are working on that update asap.
Comprehensive App for a small business. I have excellent experience and is easy to use with all functionality that I required. Have tried Xero, MYOB as well but Quickbooks stand out for me as far as feature & function and good value for money.
Powerful mobile app!. Love this app and use it all the time while on the go.
Only good thing is the price. It is a good value for the price, unfortunately that is about the only good thing about it. They need to set up some way to let you pay for the app from your company checking account instead of having to go thru an App Store. They need to make the print function available on anything you are looking at. The need auto-fill on email addresses. This app could be so much better but they rarely upgrade it because they are the only game in town. I would switch to another companies app in a heartbeat if one ever becomes available.
Fairly Good . . . But. I can't believe they offer milage tracking with the intro version, but as soon as you up grade to a more powerful version it is dropped.  I need this option too and now have to go to a completely different app to record milage.  That is a real waste of my time.
Great app.. Can do everything while on the move.
Great App but signs you out a lot. This is a great app and It works almost perfect but there's one really annoying issue. The app signed you out a lot and doesn't give you the option of entering back in with touch ID but rather having to annoyingly enter your password. Please fix this as touch ID makes life so much more convenient rather than entering your password. Doesn't always happen but more often than it should.
"Do not sign up using the app. Signing up from the App Store restricts how you can use Quickbooks online. 
You will not be able to change basic setting like email address or password. 
Sign up from a desktop. Then you can login to the app later."
Not an intuitive product. I'm very disappointed with this product. I've used Quickbooks on my laptop for two years as well as the GoPayment app. This has been extremely frustrating to setup and use for both my accountant and myself.
"Amazing app!!. Our business reconciliation just became simplified. Easy to use and online access allows us to work on the go. 

Highly recommend if you wish to save time."
Great product. Please please don't stop the mobile app
Fantastic app. Love that you can attach photos on the fly!
"Excellent product. I'm a freelance videographer and recently migrated from QB for Mac Desktop to QB online. QB online is a fantastic product and the iPhone App is an immensely useful tool. I can quickly generate invoices and keep track of my business while in the field locally or on the road anywhere. Most of my day is spent with a camera in hand far away from a laptop or office, so I use the iPhone App all the time. It's great! Only additions I might make:  Improve the ability to insert or move item lines while editing/creating invoices, make it easier set up a Customer so I can email multiple individuals within a Customer field when invoicing, make the addition of receipts easier to include (I currently snap shots of paper expense receipts, save to my camera roll, then use the ""add note"" feature in the App. If I have electronic receipts, I have to take a screenshot, then save that to my camera roll, and follow the same ""add note"" routine) It works fine, but it's bit clunky if you have many receipts, which I frequently do. All in all, an indispensable tool for my little business. Thanks!"
I'm getting used to this. I struggled at first trying to figure out what to put where but now I am inputting invoices on the fly and keeping track of my expenses and my revenues gained
So far so good. I've been using the app for a week and love it so far. I find it extremely easy to make invoices in the field, and also very convenient to accept payments.
"Incomplete and not easy to use. Privacy settings are lacking as they previously were in the online version. To be useful, I need to be able to pass the iPad to a sales associate Sioux giving them the amount of access they currently have (with the limited privacy settings). 

Also, the login and password system is cumbersome meaning it isn't quick to open up the app to charge a customers card (faster to run it through the online version)"
Brilliant mobile app. It has changed my life . I am able to do quotes in the run and save so much valuable time .
Quick books. Great app
Limited for multi user. I wanted to be able to have a an app that I could send with my field employees. This one does not allow more than gross limits on data.
Convenient, convenient, convenient!. As a small contractor always on the go this app is great with easy access to all my info. Only downfall is lack of progress billing from an invoice, but I have found a work around.
Good App. Good App great for mobile/road sales. Only wish I could view current in stock inventory qty in app and product item cost as well as retail price.
Great app. Great but fix the unicode and sync problems. And please add more functions
"Terrible!. I find it incredibly infuriating that the same issues and headaches remain with this software. How has this company not been kicked to the curb by a superior competitor yet? Marketing? I researched other competitors for hours! I've tried numerous other options. 

I hate this product and so badly hope that somebody will produce a better option. Have 2+ businesses? Quickbooks says, ""Kiss my grits!"" Quickbooks doesn't care if you are paying for multiple QBO accounts. Access from their app is limited to 1 account per device. Want to see your accounts on the run? Buy more iPhones."
"Good user experience. Found the app very useful. Made easy for me to update on the go. Report wise, might be useful to have a report that prints out the attached receipt as well. 
Good job guys"
Co-Owner. Most of our business is at the customer sites and this app makes real invoicing, estimating and other accounting possible right at the customer site. It's constantly improving, too.
Awesome!. Fantastic app.  As a freelancer I am often away from my office.  Being able to create estimates and have my clients sign them on the spot has been great.  And being able to send invoices from anywhere has absolutely changed my life! Love it.
Keeps getting more user friendly!. The new video tutorials make it easy to learn.  The portability of switching between the mobile app and the desktop version online is a priceless feature, thanks for all of your hard work!
Mr. Great app for when I'm running around out of the office.
Great Accounting App. I've been using the QuickBooks app for a over a year now and I love how it allows me to stay on top of my business accounting. I love that the app allows me to take a snapshot of my receipts and link them to their corresponding expense transactions within QuickBooks.
"Almost great but not quite there. Very useful in collaboration with desktop or online version, but does have a few annoying quirks.

I wish the most used item codes would be kept at the top of the list instead of alphabetically with the rest of default ones.

And there really needs to be a way to access and review emails sent directly from the app"
Love the app!. Absolutely love this app. I can do everything on my phone on the go and hardly ever need to pull up QB on my computer. Beautiful lay out, intuitive design and easy to use.... I'd rate it an A+ 👍
Almost great. So, the limited features in the app seem like just a lack of time to include. Otherwise, easy to use, and great way to keep track.
"Doesn't like ipads or phones. I don't find the app very useful. On a desktop, you can find your way around easily enough. On the ipad or phone, you cannot. I have yet to be able to bring up our main register balance....it takes forever and then gives me a ""no transactions"" screen. I have been a CPA for over 35 years. This app, although it has some promise,  needs a little work."
Super functional..extremely helpful. Quick books app is fantastic! Makes using my phone for invoicing and estimates very easy! Recommend to anyone..... No glitches, no hang ups..... You won't be disappointed!
"App is good for an app, online version is 4 stars. I ""upgraded"" from quick books 2014 pro on my PC to the online solution so that I could see my finances wherever I'm at, create invoices in the field with customers, and for that it is great. That's why I love the app. However the online solution as a whole is a little less feature heavy, and of course you have to pay per month. One thing I liked about quickbooks pro was that I owned the software and didn't have to worry about an additional monthly expense"
"Finally!. Ah, finally...an app worth paying for. I've been shopping around for ages trying to find a business program that suited me...there were lots suited to photographers, but the interface was kinda annoying. Quick books is great...it's simple to use, it's an app not web-browser based and the design layout is pretty nice!

Something that's missing, is I can't add my banking details or a Paypal link for different ways a client can pay me...which is a little annoying....and I'd love if we could make prettier invoices, but I guess not necessary...just my creative side wanting a bit of flair.

Overall, great so far!"
"iPad app review. I use this app for daily business. The app is great, the response from a question or change is nonexistent. 
For the type of business I do it works pretty well, would like to see the ability to bill partial or progress invoices and not have to create additional invoice or estimates if changes are made. Also, if you merge from desktop to online most of your items will not work. You have to enter new items or descriptions or the invoice will never save. 
I love how quickbooks forces you to move to the product they want you to use by discontinuing the products they don't want to support any longer, then ignore problems or concerns from customers with the new product."
"Very frustrated. I came from using a desk top Quickbooks 2010 version and now on to the Quickbooks online. I can't get a good template because it doesn't allow you to add a box or take out things you don't need. The few templates they have would be fine if it allowed me access to remove or change the name of the boxes. I need it to work for MY business and I've called customer service twice and both times they say well I'm sorry it's suppose to do that oh well. What kind of customer service is that for ""helping"" you?? Also apparently according to customer service the server is down in my area for sending emails and he can't tell me how or when it may be back up and he doesn't have a number that you can contact to let them know that it's down."
Pants app! Does not refresh, to many glitches!. Poor show on the app! Creates more work for me then needed, stick to logging in online. Far easier than trying to refresh the app manually, I'll get grey before I can do any accounting with this app!!
Great app. Great app. Only wish that it had payroll on it.
APP okay, customer SVC bad!!!!!. I've used the app and I like it, but do not use the pay online feature when sending invoices. I had a customer pay two invoices at the same time and three weeks later, I haven't received the payment. I've called Quickbooks, Quickbooks payment center several times and the only thing they do is put you on hold. The wait time is from 30 minutes to an hour, I waited on hold for an hour and was disconnected. They deposited the monies from the two invoices into a account that's not mine, and getting them to correct the problem is like pulling teeth from a hungry lion. Very dissatisfied with there customer service. I Like the app, customer service and online payments not so much.
Functionality Bugs. App works pretty well but have noticed a lot of features do not work from time to time. The logo for instance does not allow me for the past few days to upload or make changes. Then all of sudden it may work or process. Other then that the app seems to work great and fast.
"Brilliant app with loads of features!. So easy to use. So easy to learn. Instant bank feeds. Invite your Accountant & Bookkeeper & other users.  So much support from Intuit & the Australian team. What's not to like? 

Intuit have put together a great product for the small to medium business owner. 

Thoroughly recommend this product."
Not Mobile as promised!. This app is fine as a standalone, but has never been able to update any information input, and reflected on all mobile devices. It treats each device as a separate entry. Therefore, when entering a customer on one device, any attempts to then activate and reference that customer on the same device is not possible, because the customer is not found her on that device, even when it tells you it has saved the info. Likewise with transactions. Transactions entered on your PC, do not show up on your mobile devices. All of this seems to contradict the main benefit of QuickBooks online. I will be switching to desktop version as soon as possible.
Great. Good app...Need to be able to accept credit card or debit..I'm sure u guys are working on it
"Very good App.. I am an electrical/mechanical contractor and I have recently switched from Quickbooks Desktop to QBO. Mainly for the mobile ability. I do not do too much with the mobile app, but I do make an occasional invoice or receipt. It is never going to be as fast and easy as doing it on a computer, but it comes in handy. I like to look up past invoices, customer info, or my prices for various materials. The only thing I can really say that I would like to see changed, is the ability to see the vendor/supplier info under a product. I take the time to enter the ""description on purchase forms"" on the computer, but I can't see it on my phone. I have an iPhone 5s and it works great. The map function transitions to the map app seamlessly. I can add photos easily into the QBO app via the ""Notes"" function. Another thing that can't be done on the mobile app is that you can't view inventory info, and if you make an invoice on your pc and added an expense to the invoice, you are not able to view it on the mobile app."
Truly mobile accounting apps. I have tried for a few days and it give me an impression that i can finish all my accounting without going back to desktop. It use the camera of phone wisely.
STATEMENTS!. PLEASE add the ability to send a statement(s) from the mobile app. Thank you!
"Great system easy to use. I really like the online version better than the windows.
The app is easy to use 
I highly recommend this app
Quick books has completely changed the way I run my business.
Every thing is so organized and neat now. I don't lose recipes any more. Witch is a plus
The total functionality of the system is great."
Love it!. This app is great. I can almost do everything I need to on it. Great way to check accounts on the go.
"Saving expense takes forever... Didn't used to!. When you save an expense with an attached photo/receipt, the beach ball spins for so long, I simply can't use the app. I wind up entering all my expenses at the end of the month on my computer. 

I wind up having to manually kill the process, then go back in and see what didn't save, I.E. The receipt. 

Fix this!"
Great Accounting. The app is great and syncs perfectly with my quickbooks online account. Makes billing from multiple sites quick and easy on the go.
Best App for Accounting. I used another app before but quickly switched to Quickbooks. It is by far the best out there in the market in terms of features and ease of use. I am not an accounting expert but now I can quickly generate my financial statements and get funded. Thanks a lot!
Improving. Each new version a little better than the last. Just like QB Online for Mac App, both need more features to compete with the rest of the QB product line.
Great. I haven't had any trouble with quick books. It's easy to create customers and vendors. I am able to quickly submit expenses/sales transactions into the app and emailing customer receipts is a snap. It gives my company a professional edge and my account is going to be a happy camper!
"Fantastic features. All the features that works under this single app. I used to work with excel spreadsheet, invoice app, expense app to complete the business on the go. 
Now everything has being simplify into this one subscription saving me time and double entry. I am absolutely happy that I can email invoice, take pictures and enter expense using my iPhone. Best of all these is update into the cloud.
Great excellent accounting software nothing comes close after trying others accounting software."
Need o and p. Really need to add a way for someone to mark up of the invoice and show change orders to estimates.
Almost right. Love the Quickbooks online app. Use it on both my iPhone and iPad--very easy to generate quotes on-site.  Just wish it allowed me to do purchase orders!
Crash, crash, crash. This app will crash and after every single thing you!
"Weak iPhone app, no customer service. Really weak app, no customer service. After trying to contact qb customer service, I got no response from anybody at qb.
After paying big monthly fees $ I'm switching back to invoice2go, where I got great customer service and my feedbacks were used in improvements."
"Great app. The fusion is terrific. Quick books online plus this app had already simplified my life. No more double duty entering transactions. Plus I now know who owes, and who's late without having to sit in front of a computer combing a bank printout. 

Some things that could make it better...a linked PayPal pay option in the invoice email, and a way for a customer to easily send a notice of payment. Also, if I could pull in new customer or supplier info from my iPhone contact list it would save a fair bit of redundant data entry, as I need the listings both places. 

But all-in-all a real winner."
"Getting better all the time. Still needs tweaking.. I use this app for my business every day, and the mobility is excellent. Saves so much time in paperwork.

The iPad version is very solid. 

The one issue we regularly run into on the iPhone version is that we haven't figured out how to select whether a discount is before or after tax. On the iPad it's a simple arrow that makes the change, but if it's a possibility on the iPhone, it's a mystery to us how it's done. If that issue were fixed, I'd rate it 5 stars, since I really love the app overall."
Amazing app!!!!. Love Quickbooks and also the app. Excellent layout design. JUST ONE THING IS NEEDED. PLEASE allow the app to support TouchID for the login process. This would be just the best update ever! Thanks
Great Small Business App. Just opened up my first company,being a one person office ,secretary, and boss this app is great to help micro manage all your small office responsibilities. It's a great app to email quick quotes onsite for that customer who looking for the job to get done asap. Have to say this made my work day is alot easier and definitely is less complicated!!!!
Owner. Makes life very easy for me running my small electrical contracting business. I spend less time writing estimates and invoicing.
Owner. Great app
Great app for on the go guys. Great for the road warriors who are in the field working and don't have time to do office work
Good app. No complains
Great app. What a great app and ease of access across all platforms.
A+. App works great
"Absolutely Fantastic!. This app is incredible. Having been using for 6 months, and it has revolutionised the way we are able to do business.
So easy to setup, use and understand.

I highly recommend to anyone that needs an easy order/invoice/sales system for their business."
"Not user friendly. Not a simple app to use, most of them aren't though. If your a tradesman and want an app that's like filling out a carbon copy job invoice I only found one, and then they screwed me -and many other people- by changing it to a subscription service. 

Might as well just keep using the old format on quick books on my computer. Pain in the butt to navigate, as are all of these, but at least it's paid for and I own it. I don't have to pay a monthly ransom to use or access my own business property."
Great app. I using this app for my business is so easy the handle it thank you guys for this great app
QB app. Excellent app is very funcional
Excellent app. Keeps all my invoices, estimates, espenses in order and easy to use
Great app. Easy to use. Love the 4 digit log in option.
Business on the run. Quickbooks online with the IOS app make operating a travel based business on the run simple. Log invoices as you go. Input estimates along the way. Print and mail or email all at once at the end of the day. Not to mention the helpful reports and expense management. I couldn't run my business without it.
Quickbooks. Super easy to use!  I was able to backlog and bring my business up to speed with quickbooks within a few hours after downloading quickbooks!  Operating the app is fun and accessible!
"Not useable in multi-user environment. Another update and I stand behind my previous review(s).

Seriously? Another update, and still not multi-user friendly.  But, oh boy, something works with Apple Watch.  When will Intuit fix the multi-user issues?  Someone else mentions they fix bugs.  Don't be fooled, they fix the bugs they want to fix, but apparently none of the bugs that keeps my business from using this app.

I want to use and like this app. I've looked at every update since the very 1st version.  It does seem to be slowly improving, but is still not useable.
My business has more than 1 user account.
Locations and Classes do not work in their accounts.  Not in any sales forms.  Not in expenses.
When my other users go to Customers, they see total sales for the last 90 days.  They do not need to, nor should they see this.
If I cant't have my employees use this app, it is useless!"
Great app. Very happy with the app so far. There is a couple thing that would be nice to be able to do from my I pad and not have to go to my computer hopefully in the next update they will.
Serious billing issues.. The app started out wonderful. I could do anything I needed on the fly, then my monthly renewal came along. My card had expired, so I had to update my info and resubmit, not a big deal. It has been 8 days and they say they can't do anything about it, except convert me over to Intuit billing, which is almost $10 more a month. I would not recommend using this until they get things figured out with Apple billing.
Brilliant. Used other software apps before now and this one knocks socks off them, can access all my account details and add bills and send invoices so much easier during the day now, knocks about 30minutes a night off my admin
Still needs some changes. Multiple addresses for a company is still a drama as it changes all pervious invoices and quotes. Plus now on the iPad version it says I can't access until subscription is paid but it is.. Works on computer but can't use my iPad. Annoying!!!
Fantastic Accounting App. I love that this allows me the freedom to work and to monitor my accountant's progress on the go. It's extremely user friendly and easy to use. Many features save tons of time on simple book keeping tasks. Smashes traditional softwares like UBS and MYOB into the dust!
Quickbooks. Super easy to use!  I was able to backlog and bring my business up to speed with quickbooks within a few hours after downloading quickbooks!  Operating the app is fun and accessible!
"Great little app. Excellent app for basic book keeping invoicing  etc and keep up with the book keeping on the fly.
But to do the serious stuff you still need to work from a laptop or desktop."
Great tool for any business owner.. QB Online is a great resource for any business owner AND any individual that wants to get away from the paper-and-pencil ways of managing their finances. It allows for quick invoicing, keeps client/vendor information handy and auto-populates their info on forms, allows you to run tons of reports and is fully customizable to suit my business needs. All of my products and services are ready in drop down menus so I just tap a few buttons while I'm out in the field and I can send receipts, invoices, anything. It's smart and can connect to ALL of my accounts and imports that info to a digital check register. When my CPA need info, I can email it straight from the app or, if you're lazy like me, just give them the login info and they have access to whatever they need.  I've been told that QB can also be automated to send out docs on its own, after the right set up, but I have yet to get to that level.
If it worked.... Won't load my bank balance in the app I have to do it on the laptop, it's frozen twice and can't connect to QB online. Had it 12 hours so far
Great job. Great app. Very well designed and very user friendly
Great App. Coming from using Xero for my accounting software, I can say this app and platform as a whole is far more superior. I would recommend to anyone to switch to QuickBooks.
"Best idea yet!. Run a one-man business on this app, it's the best idea. Once in a while, life has its financial surprises, and would be nice If there's an option that you could pay your dues without having to call, especially on weekends when no ones there so the business doesn't stop or on a stand still.
And would also be great if intuit would allow an online payment for our customers that can be tag onto our own websites...that would be a nice touch, one option monthly billing!
Still, awesome job! Love the app so far!"
Needs a lot of work. Needs the ability to update bank accounts from the bank, as for now it only syncs with updates made on my Windows or Mac computers. Needs access to all reports available. I had hoped this app would be a full version substitute when a laptop or desktop computer is not available.
Great app only downfall is.... I like the app the only downfall is if your an employee you can't track your hours on here like you can with the QB on a computer.. Also you can't delete a payment if you see you already added it. If so idk how to do these things.
Total crap. This app doesn't work. It shows numbers which doesn't make sense, you can't rely on it. I just go to safari web and login to my quick books account. Please change it if you can.
"Easy to use. As a small business I find this to be a fabulous experience of accounting software integrated across all my various devices. 

I feel far more in control of my books than any other format or program I have used before.  

Highly recommend this to any mobile business."
Small-business Rocket!. Great app. This is making my small business very productive. Especially since the account is device agnostic. I can use it on my device or login online and be just as efficient.
Works and convenient. Easy way to enter sales and expenses. I've had no problems with this app.
"Pretty app, but not up to the job.. I downloaded this app to look at it for a client.
I was disappointed that it would not process supplier invoices and could not handle banking accumulated cash. It seems to handle VAT alright but it does not produce a report to help you put you fill in your VAT return online.
On the plus side the sales invoicing is smooth, although I had a minor issue with a technical error. I like the ability to review the status of your customer and supplier accounts and manage business contacts. The ability to e-mail contacts from the supplier/customer interface is useful.
Overall if this was sold as a sales control app with additional functionality I might not have been as disappointed as I was.
I hope 
Intuit get their act together and upgrade this soon as it has the potential to be very good."
"Great system easy to use. I really like the online version better than the windows.
The app is easy to use there's some issues with it though, i would ole like it better if you could use and access every thing as if you were on your computer. I don't always have time to sit down at the desk and go threw every thing."
Killer app. Killer service.. The app is great, arguably better than the online version. Great for keeping track of transactions and uploading photos of receipts.
Love it!. We've used QB for about a decade, and LOOOVE the new app. Makes life easier!!
Great UI and mobile to desktop experience. I just started using QuickBooks about two months ago and I don't know what I would do without it now. It's simple, easy to run a freelance business with. It's helped me become a freelance business and get paid which is the most important part :)
Great app. The app is easier to use than the online version on a laptop. Well done.
Could be better. While it's great to access your company file while mobile it lacks certain details and/ or functions that make it a complete app. The option for creating Purchase Orders is available but only for an expense not an inventory item. Disappointed.
Great app, very useful and always improving!. This app is the greatest tool in our businesses ability to streamline work, easy to use.
WHY!?!. This app and online program is insanely buggy. Every time I try and open the app it takes five or six trys before it loads. Once it loads I am satisfied at best with the user experience, but if my internet connection isn't a gig a second the app crashes. I wish I didn't pay for a years worth of service or I would delete it with extreme prejudice.
Fits my needs. Easy app, portable. Thank you
Actually makes accounting a little bit fun. I absolutely love the way this app allows me to record, photograph and categorise expenses from receipts. So easy that it actually is fun. Delighted that I can get rid of all this paper!
Quickbooks ONLINE is a nightmare!. BIG MISTAKE. If you are considering Quickbooks ONLINE talk to some bookkeepers first or you may find yourself doing the books because so many of them refuse to work with the ONLINE version. Once you upload your data to the online version there is no way of downloading the data to go back to regular Quickbooks! As for the APP, well it's as frustrating as as the online program.
Super functional..extremely helpful. Quick books app is fantastic! Makes using my phone for invoicing and estimates very easy! Recommend to anyone..... No glitches, no hang ups..... You won't be disappointed!
Missing Critical Feature. The app is decent but is missing the ability to add a Delayed Charge. This breaks the workflow of employees in the field. Anything available in the web app needs to be available in the mobile app as well.
Great app. Great app!
"What are the transactions for??. I want to like this app.  It would be so nice to do a little mobile on the go bookkeeping, but how is it helpful to have all of my transactions in front of me if the app fails to download any of the supporting data including the NAME of business of where the expense came from??  It's impossible to even know what anything is!  All I see are dollar amounts and dates.  An expense and accounting software is pretty useless unless you can see what your transactions are actually for!

Keep trying Quickbooks!"
Awesome. This app is great and very robust
Great App. Very good app to manage Quickbooks when you are away from your desk.
Great app. I have no complaints.
QBO is awesome!. We've been an intuit customer since 2001, this past year we converted to the online version of Quickbooks; never been happier. The simplicity of the app(s) and how easy it is to do common tasks saves us time and money. Keep up the good work!
Good features and functionality. Lots of functionality right from your phone. I like the fingerprint sign-in when resuming the app. Would be good to see a save as PDF feature on invoices and quotes. I'd like to be able to upload them to the cloud from my phone or attachment them to an existing email I am writing rather than having to email separately.
Works great!. Having the app, makes it easier to give my clients an exact total immediately. It also makes it easier to track payments and purchases.
Works like it should!. The app works well and most everything is in the same place as the desktop version.
"Very pretty but lacks functionality I need. The two main things I would like to be able to do with this app aren't possible. 
1) I want to look up my open/unpaid bills to suppliers and see how much is outstanding. The suppliers section only gives me their contact details??? Who decided that would be useful??
2) I want to look up the employees/payroll section to verify payroll info. This isn't there. 

Thankfully I don't need to do create invoices from the app - I can't do it without access to my extensive pricing list (have to just enter an amount).

I also can't do any of these things in the iPad app, nor by logging to the webpage from my phone. I need an actual computer to do it. 

I have found that I can look at my profit and loss graph. It's very pretty. But doesn't help with day to day running of my business. 

Whoever is in charge of designing the functionality of this app - I seriously hope they will be making some changes in the future."
Nonexistent customer service. I have had some very poor experiences with QuickBooks desktop versions. The product itself is generally fairly good but customer service is ridiculous. So when I was looking for a accounting program to use on the smart phones, I was reluctant to go with QuickBooks after using three different companies and having a good experience with Fresh-books. In the end I only went with QuickBooks because the they were the only ones who had a Canadian payroll system available. So far a horrible mistake. I signed on with my credit card to turn my trial basis into a regular subscription, complete with printed receipt. Now it is still not giving me what I paid for and warning me that my trial period is about to end. That in itself is annoying, but trying to actually contact a real person in their customer service is virtually impossible. In comparison to when they were trying to get me to sign on and were phoning me personally.  So my recommendation is to go with anybody but QuickBooks. Oh, and if there's an actual person who works for QuickBooks, my invoice number is B1–7383544. In case you actually want to fix this disaster.
Very Mobile. The App is excellent for anyone on the go. Easy to upload info from the app. User friendly. Tried a few other book keeping apps and found this to be the best by far
Great app. I use this everyday and love it. Very easy to use.
Great Functionality. Great app! Great way to keep up with receipts on the go.
So far so good. Very good for tracking expenses on the road to avoid paperwork when back at the office. Nice simple mobile interface.
"Couldn't ask for more!. Everything you need, intuitive and great access with mobile apps!

Can't believe the value for money!"
Seriously Easy Software. Great app for a great product!
Upholstery shop. Very good app
Excellent. First time setting up a new business and first time I've used book keeping software. You can do so much with just this app - it's incredibly intuitive and so easy to use. Stops me being afraid of the numbers side of my business and just lets me get on with work! Absolute game changer. Love it.
Freedom!. As a small business owner my time is extremely precious.  While I do a lot of things extremely well paperwork and filing is not one of them. I have found QuickBooks online to be extremely beneficial in not only meeting my clients needs but in helping me maintain the day to day of business finance. Tracking job expenses, invoicing onsite, and managing credit / bank accounts from my phone are just a few the features I use daily. Well worth the money in my opinion.
Owner. This application and online service is the best I have ever used. It keeps me up to date with all book keeping. The reports it provide makes doing taxes a synch. The only thing I haven't mastered is tracking all jobs separately. If I can get this program to give me a report identifying what the profit was on each job that would help tremendously. I am fairly a new user about 2 years off and on. Other than that, I give this app
"Like it so far.... I am glad they have a mobile app to support QB Online. I have used the desktop version for years but hated having to upgrade all the time. One change I would make is when entering expenses, I would like a ""debit card"" button with the cash, credit and check buttons. I use the ""check"" button for them now."
Great APP. Works great for customer signature!
Waiting for updates. Quite frankly, it's been totally useless. The app does not sync new data entries with the online database. I've already spent well over three hours with multiple customer support reps. The idea of creating invoices is great....only problem....IT DOES NOT WORK!!!
Quickbooks online is lacking in a number of areas. First of all the payroll service and the support that comes with the payroll service is substandard based on my experience. The support staff is not very helpful. Also the software used to be better, but it stopped doing all the forms as of recently and you have to manually do some of the forms. Intuit once an innovator of financial software has been lacking in recent years on a number of their products, they just don't seem to care about customer service and the quality of their software's as they used to. At some point, I am probably going to switch to Xero as I find both the customer service and the progression of the software not to par and even amateurish in many aspects.
More of a headache than a help. Registered online, used same login info for the app, and the app says it's a free trial. Online service not communicating well with app and I was hoping to use the app most of the time. Sigh.
QuickBooks App. It has all the tools I need and is very convenient
Best app for my business!. Not a good app when it doesn't download your banking, nor did it make good invoices/estimates. I love InvoicesASAP, but this app needs help.
Great app. I love it. Great!
Excellent app!. Anything that can please my accountant and help me stay organised gets my vote!
Needs a calendar interface. Great app, a clickable calendar link would make it more user friendly
Works well. Works great across all devices. Very convenient. Great time saver. Excellent app.
Freezes. Freezes when saving a new client. App is useless.
Love the convenience. Great app
"Nice app that works well!!. Works well, well thought out and presented. 

Helps me day to day for sure!!"
Worthless. I can hardly wait for retirement. Then i won't need this junk from this company any more. I have been using the quickbooks online through Safari browser on my ipad for quite some time now. Did what i needed it to do. Then intuit decides to upgrade and now i can't get it to work on my browser. I have tried every browser with fake user id but no go. Now i have to either buy a computer or buy a windows tablet. Or perhaps i should find another accounting program ?  The ipad app is useless as teats on a goose. How can they even offer such crap.
Small business owner. This app is PERFECT! 100% of what I need all the time!
Landscape company. I like this app as it helps me stay on top of the billing before I leave the site.  It is quick and easy to use once set up with your desired pricing.   Customers are surprised at how quick the bill is in and how great  the invoices look. If you are just starting or want more family time I suggest this oh and for receipts you can take pictures and save them in the phone. The only part i hate is the billing is monthly only by credit card.   They need a yearly subscription.  First year buy a box set as it is cheaper i am now in my second year of using this and madly in love with it.
Great app.. Love the app, it's just what I need to do my work.
Very nice app. Very easy to use and make my all estimates and invoices very smooth and keep the updates very soon
App is great for any business. I have a small business and this application is awesome. Especially if you have a mobile business. This make like so much easier for your customer to pay online. Inventory management is very easy to use and update
"Not useable in multi-user environment. Seriously? Another update, and still not multi-user friendly.  But, oh boy, something works with Apple Watch.  When will Intuit fix the multi-user issues?  Someone else mentions they fix bugs.  Don't be fooled, they fix the bugs they want to fix, but apparently none of the bugs that keeps my business from using this app.

I want to use and like this app. I've looked at every update since the very 1st version.  It does seem to be slowly improving, but is still not useable.
My business has more than 1 user account.
Locations and Classes do not work in their accounts.  Not in any sales forms.  Not in expenses.
When my other users go to Customers, they see total sales for the last 90 days.  They do not need to, nor should they see this.
If I cant't have my employees use this app, it is useless!"
Good start. I wish I could log my time on the app. I suppose I have to pay extra for that. Big disappointment.
Great app!!. This is a fine app, help me to run my business on the go.
Great!. Continues to impress and improve on this very useful app. I use it daily for bids, invoices and expenses. The addition of the ability to record expenses and photograph receipts has made my life so much more easy. and to be able to quickly add clients, easy estimates and quick invoices and finally receive payments is unbelievable and wonderful.
Finger print capable. You can now log into the app using your finger print
"Receipts no longer a 1 person job. If you purchase it, you expense it directly to QB! Saves me, the accountant, hours. Don't worry I can still reconcile to our bank and credit cards plus double check entries. Never been so easy. 
Only disadvantaged is I use a separate app to scan receipts versus a picture. Scan is much more document friendly. Maybe next release?!?!"
Great app. QB app is great and it's only improving. I can't wait to see how this app will operate in a year.
"Awesome app. I run a small business and I use quick books to manage my entire business! From estimates to invoices to getting paid its all so easy and fun to use! 
Thanks guys"
The Best App Ever!!!!. There's no word I can use to describe this App. This is the BEST App I've ever seen. The Functionality and the ease of use on iPhone is amazing. 95% of my daily transactions are done on my phone. I Love this App. Good job intuit. No App does it better.
Perfect software for the right companies. I absolutely love it! I have a small freelance design company, so I'm billing for services and commissions. There is nothing I need that it doesn't do and do well. I don't need inventory, estimates or payroll, so this program is about as friendly to me as it could possibly be.
Great App!!. I love it! This program has totally transformed our family business!!
Great app. Good for a non accounting person like me. I can keep track and give it all to my accountant and it gets done. I love that I can send invoices from my iPad and enter info etc. two thumbs up!
"Very good. Good job I would like to add pictures to the estimates

I would like to see a calendar with all the jobs and I would like to drag them to change it to a different date"
Perfect. Great App and works terrifically. Thanks.
"Pretty Great App. I've been using the app for 4 months now. It's great if you're a small business owner that wants to be able to pull reports on the go without having to carry your laptop around. 
Touch ID support was a great addition"
Great For My Business. This app has been an absolute vital part in helping me run my business.  I love it!
Just what I needed. I run a small contractor business doing remodel work.  The mobile app has been a god-send.  I can track all my estimates, invoices & expenses in one place.  Helps me track clients that are late payers too (which sometimes happens).  I like it.  100% worth the subscription
Good, but needs to get better. QuickBooks Online is a welcome change from the shackles of the desktop version, but there are still key features and functionality missing (in the app as well as in the browser) to really make this useful. Like.... being able to manually adjust the amount of sales tax on a general journal entry.
Rubbish. Doesn't work. Need to add bills but can't. How ridiculous to not have this function. Deleted. No support from Customer service
Getting better and better. The app was mediocre a couple of yard ago but still useful. It's getting more polished and even better now. Good app!
It is ok. The mobile app is ok. Limited access. Really not much use to it except check your P/L and entering transaction.
Great app. This app is a great supplement to the Mac version very very helpful
"Great app. I don't understand what some people are complaining about it. This app works great. 
Thank you"
Great app, continues to get better. Best decision I ever made for my business was moving to QB Online. Saves a ton of time being able to conduct business on the fly.
Amazing. This app is a life saver! Started my own HVAC company in March of 2015 and this is the only app I use for keeping track of finances, invoicing, payroll and taxes. It really makes running my business as easy as possible! Love it, thanks Quickbooks!!
WHY???. FOR THE LOVE OF GAWD, WHY CAN I NOT ADD A DELAYED CHARGE ON THE MOBILE APP??????  This is something you actually WANT to do when you're at a client, not get them to sign for an invoice every time you visit them during the month.
Intuit Keeps Working it But Stumbles on Occasion. I've been a QBO user for 32 months now and run my whole one-man business on it. Each app version is a bit better than the last and they do fix bugs when notified. I continue to be happy to see Intuit continue to improve the app and the web interface. The latest version of the iPad app significantly improves the Reports category. The invoice and estimates form disaster of May 2015 has been rectified they've rolled dissatisfied customers back to the old forms and are reworking the new ones.
One thing missing.... This app is super convenient for managing our business on the go. But I can't see a way to create an iPhone contact from within the customer details screen. If that feature was added this app would be perfect!!
"Reduced feature set. Previous version:The feature set of the web based app is not matched. (Previous mentioned currency and time records).
Update: Removed a lot of preexisting functionality and did not add any missing functions. Much worse than before.  Cannot find a list of invoices due to a supplier.  Clicking on a particular supplier brings up only the address particulars."
Good app. It's come a long ways since it was first introduced.  Can't be without it!
Works when you're on the go!. Easy app navigation. Easy to create, send,invoices.
Good enough for read-only. This app is good for knowing which clients owe money and how much.  Great for seeing payments and invoices.  But don't try to get my real-work done on this.  So I use it in a pinch when I need to look up a client or vendor.
"Good for Basic Mobile Use. I've been a Quickbooks desktop user for years and switched to the web-based mobile app a year or so ago. it's VERY stripped down in features and custom form options in comparison. While I had to compromise some of the robust power I was used to, the mobile options makes it worth it. I'd like to see a few extras especially in customizing forms, but it is usable as long as you're flexible. If you are a small business owner on the go who needs some reliable basic bookkeeping options with invoicing anytime, anywhere, then this app works. 

Reports are pretty solid as well. Here, I definitely prefer it on my iPad."
Intuit Disappoints. I've been a QBO user for 32 months now and run my whole one-man business on it. Each app version is a bit better than the last and they do fix bugs when notified. I continue to be happy to see Intuit continue to improve the app and the web interface. However, the latest change, the revision of the invoice and estimate forms, is a total mess. Fields aren't wide enough and user data gets merged and crammed together. Completely unprofessional forms pushed out to users without warning or recourse.
Good but needs more. I love this App and use it every day - it has taken me from doing my accounts once a year and being ridiculously late with invoicing, to On the spot invoicing and totally up to date with everything ... EXCEPT receiving payments
Great accounting app. So far i like it. Pretty much easy to use
Awesome app. Feature rich and also user friendly
Very good app. If I could link my ICall to it, it would be perfect 5 stars
Effective app!. Truly effective application.
"Fees on fees. While the app itself works and is fairly handy, I strongly advise against quickbooks as a company. I signed on as a business owner for $6.95 a month and was immediately slapped with over $100 in fees hidden in ""fine print"". Worse is the utter inability to get any customer support from Intuit. I canceled my subscription and despite already paying for the month, lost access immediately and lost all of my records. Then I got billed AGAIN. Stay away."
I love Quickbooks Online. I love Quickbooks Online & my accountant does also. This app is really good for doing your expenses on but as far as invoicing I still do it on the computer. It's very handy for a small business. The fact you can enter an expense, take a picture of the receipt & go on your merry way. I'm sold.
Awesome app. Love it
Best accounts app. Seems to be the best one out there, easy to use on iPhone
First class. Really a great app makes life easier
very efficient. very efficient app, very handy
"Not at all what we had with desk top version. We have been using QuickBooks desktop since 2008 decided to switch over to QuickBooks online to streamline our business. After spending hours on the phone with tech support for some of the basic features that were on the desktop are no longer available in the online version. Their support was please provide feedback and our tech-support guys will see what they can do to Ed and handsome it's to the system since the program is not 100% the same as the original versions and desktop. I do have to ask what they pay for. Especially when cannot copy and paste when adding product or service information. I line items on the product cannot be highlighted or made bold. Cannot get a check number to be shown on paid invoices. Cannot assign more than one email to a customer this is much required when one department handles billing and another department handles estimating etc. sub customers or just a waste of time in a new QuickBooks you cannot provide customer information as a sub customer and have it being billed to the primary customer without the sub customers address and the primary billing address on the estimate or the invoice. Searching for customers or addresses can be aggravating especially if you don't type it in the exact way that you and put it into QuickBooks. There is no fax number option or box. The drop-down menus you cannot expand the width of those to view your product selection nor does the mouse always work when you have a pointed on your product to see what the full description is. Some other things that would be nice to be able to freeze the top bar of your product list or customers or reports as well as possibly changing to bold format to highlight your products and services primary category from its subcategories. I have recently been trying invoice to go which seems very more user-friendly if QuickBooks cannot get their act together that maybe my go to program.

Basics what about spell check!!! If it's there it's not easy to find or it doesn't work!!!"
"Very good App.. I am an electrical/mechanical contractor and I have recently switched from Quickbooks Desktop to QBO. Mainly for the mobile ability. I do not do too much with the mobile app, but I do make an occasional invoice or receipt. It is never going to be as fast and easy as doing it on a computer, but it comes in handy. I like to look up past invoices, customer info, or my prices for various materials. The only thing I can really say that I would like to see changed, is the ability to see the vendor/supplier info under a product. I take the time to enter the ""description on purchase forms"" on the computer, but I can't see it on my phone. I have an iPhone 5s and it works great. The map function transitions to the map app seamlessly. I can add photos easily into the QBO app via the ""Notes"" function. All-in-all it is a good interface."
QB Rocks. This is a great app to stay on top of your business while on the go. Whether in the office, at home, or on vacation, make sure your payables and receivables match.
Taking our business to a new level. We have been SO happy since we switched to Quickbooks Online Plus! It has allowed us to streamline our invoicing and bookkeeping. Our clients love how easy it is to pay invoices online. We love knowing we've received payment for each cleaning performed! QB customer service is excellent.
Love the mobile app. They have made huge improvements to the mobile app. I don't have to access my desktop version as much. Has greatly improved my ability to send invoices to customers in the fly. Has decreased waiting for payments of invoices dramatically.
Nice to Use. App puts info at fingertips. Run reports, check balances and review transactions easily.
Jtw1234567. Awesome app. I don't have time to do all of this and run my business too.
Pretty good. Pretty good app. Could use a little improvement. Doesnt have all the functions of the regular version.
Ran into unsupported transactions within 1 minute. Very disappointing.  It seems like the app isn't complete.
Yep. Great app...appart from the lack of multi currency function...
"Online is the only relevant version for today's small to medium business.. We originally bought 2015 Pro with Payroll and were very disappointed when we realized that it was not accessible remotely. 

Who makes a product today that has ""Pro"" in the name, but is not mobile!?!

Anyways, after loading all of our information, invoices, expenses and customer information; we realized its limitations. After calling QB, we decided to move to QB Online. 

QB Online has a much better and easier to use interface then QB Pro. It was easy to load everything on to it, create invoices, document and categorize expenses, and see reporting. 

This will be the version that we stay with."
Perfect software for the right companies. I absolutely love it! I have a small freelance design company, so I'm billing for services and commissions. There is nothing I need that it doesn't do and do well. I don't need inventory, estimates or payroll, so this program is about as friendly to me as it could possibly be.
Like the app but need update for iphone 6 plus. App and software work well for my business but i was disappointed that the app on a iphone 6 plus is just magnified from the 5s. I really hoped it was a scaled iPad experience. Really... NO Landscape mode?
Good app. Good interface. Most frequently used functions included.
Needs Work. For such a big name app, I'm very surprised that it still hasn't been updated for iPhone 6, especially considering we all pay $15-40 a month for the service. The app could also benefit from Touch ID login, instead of requiring a PIN code.
Love this app!!. Could run our company without it!!
Great start. App is perfect for a small business. The sooner you get organized using the app the less work you have to do down the road. Love it
"Good app with a few issues. Easy to use. Easy to enter receipt into it. Switching between companies is s pain you must log in and out to do that.  

Overall a useful tool."
Flawless. First app that I've used that really hasn't had any problems at all. I do most on my computer but this is nice to have in case you're in a jam
"Great for small business. I am a partner in a small mobile based business and the financial dealings are my responsibility. 

Quick Books Online along with the app make everything so much easier than what we were previously using. Using the app is pretty intuitive and you can accomplish anything I need to at a job site."
"Horrible. If anyone wants to make a fortune, it would be creating a software that actually works for a mobile small business. First of all, if you have inventory of different types, finding the item requires you to go through pages, making it unusable on your phone. Second, intuit cannot seem to get it together and integrate the different services- if you have a problem with the app, you get transferred to people who are supposed to be help, and say things like ""oh, I know a bit about the app because I play with it at night on my phone"". If you do things like download the app and create a n account on your phone, and service changes (even upgrades!) require hours of transfers to confused service people who have been put in a horrible position of trying to make a completely ridiculous issues sound easily fixable. I really can't say enough how awful this experience has been. Would someone please design an option?!?!"
Excellent for the IT Service Provider. As an IT Service Provider, this app allows me to log my hours and mileage in the field. I can even email customer invoices immediately after services are performed. This is, of course, paired with Quickbooks Online Plus, which allows you to log hours per customer. Highly recommended!!
Most productive app. Using this app on my iPhone and iPad hs made my life so much easier! I've been able to invoice my customers without having to lug me laptop around. Truly an awesome app!
"Very Limited, please just make QBO work on Safari!. Update 2015: One reason I want to use QBO Plus online is for use on the iPad.  Functionality on Safari and Safari mobile seems to get worse over time.  I don't want to have to put in my long and complicated email and password every time I use the app.  I want integration with 1Password. Every time I look at the apps I waste hours of my time trying to get it to work.  BTW the Payroll app does have even have the basic functionality to be useful for me.  Sometimes I wonder - I am paying QB quite a lot of money every single month but every use is full of annoyances.

2014
I just want to get it into Intuit's online site for payroll and QB.  It works fine, and I could do a lot from it, even on the smaller screen of the iPad.  This app does nothing I need to do and the mobile site is useless too.  But the browser is always redirected to the mobile site with no way to go to the normal website.  

The iPad is my new laptop now and usually very functional.  As long as functionality is not purposefully broken!"
Anytime Fitness Owner. Great app. Intuitive, clean & high functioning. Just wish Transfer money and a help link was a function. If it is, please advise.
Still does not allow entering employee time. The ability to enter employee time is a must for professionals that are on the road all day. Other services like Freshbooks already have this ability. Until Intuit makes this VERY IMPORTANT addition to the mould App, it does not deserve 5 stars!
Great App. Very user friendly. Easy to edit and add customers.
Great for Start Ups. I am wanting to know if it has been considered for users to use their finger print as an option other than the password to sign in on the app?
Quick books on line and app. Would be a great program, if it supported Merchant Services, and multiple customer pricing, I  like the convenience of having it on my phone to bill customers. Can't customize invoices either, so another issue. Hope they make a few of these changes so I can switch from my desktop version.
Good app. Good app
It's a good basic app. I like the app and I really enjoy Quickbooks online. I would like for the invoices to allow my clients to pay through paypal and  to be able to scan receipts instead of manually entering the data. The app is fairly limited but it's good enough for a quick overview when you need it.
"Needs a little improvement.. Not able to transfer data from invoices to sale receipt but from estimates to invoices you can?!?!??? Also customs changes for customs style for invoices, estimates, and sale receipts don't save correctly but overlap one another.

I have been using this app for a few months and other then those issues i hope developers improve, I think this app is very good with invoices, accepting payments, creating sales receipt and user friendly setup. I really do like the app and is very clear just needs basic improvements. Hope to see them really soon."
On the go. The App is excellent for anyone on the go.
Best accounting app I've used. This makes my business run smooth and conveniently, I hope they bring more functionality to it still.
Makes life easier!!. Quickbooks online, the app, and gopayment have all made my life so much easier. I can now track things in the go and accept payments right on my phone. It works seamlessly!
"Great for people on the go. Has made business so much easier!

Can't send Purchase Order to vendor from mobile app"
I like the new app. Clean and easy to use!
"Beautiful app, curious about next features.. The revamped QB online is really attractive. Still people coming from the classic QB are missing features.

QB uses a great system to allow  customers to vote for features. 

The success of the online version will depend on how fast QB development will be able to produce the big wishlist of new features."
Perfect for in the go. I've used invoice2go, fresh books and a few other invoicing apps.  Quick books is the real deal and makes your life much easier.  Highly recommend!
Great, not perfect.... If you're looking for snapshots of where your company finances are, this app is great.  It works well for giving me good information on the go.  However, it seems like real, intensive work is best saved for the online version.  I really like it but understand the limitations.  Worth a try, certainly.
Love It!. Quickbooks has changed the way we invoice and track expenses. The ability to provide estimates then convert to invoices is amazing. The mobile app allows me to work on the go.
Great App but. I have been using the desktop 2012 version and have been used to navigating that. The online version would do well to have a more compatible and similar version for experienced users.
Excellent business app. A must have for small businesses. Excellent.
"Great app. Excellent app that Integrates with lots of other apps I use.  It has saved me many hours doing my accounts. (Game changer for sure!) - I just wish I could change the wording ""shipping address"" to ""property address"" but maybe in time"
Great app. Super friendly and sweet app
"Not useful, unnecessary details, WASTE TIME!!. When we want to enter any items on estimate or invoice, all the items pop up... Thousands.... We are trying to write to item name but name isn't pop up from list, I mean you have to write manually all the item name or you have to find on the products list and need to choice..just waste time, it should be fast, useful, easy.. Like google, like i phone.. 
we can manage everything on the mobil device. We can't carry the laptop every time so we need to control and do everything with i pad or i phone.. Not everybody but the owners want to see everything on their i pads. Just give one access for him and the other users. Charge whatever you want just do it what we need pls. 
Not unnecessary details please;
Usually business need estimate, invoice, expenses and inventory.. If we need more we have to buy them and we have to add our app. Not employees, a lots of complicated things.. Pls do it special mobile app easy to use."
Perfect for Small Businesses. I run our homeowners association with a budget of less than 100k. Quickbooks is the perfect app for managing the everyday finances for our small business. It literally takes less than 15 minutes every quarter to send out 24 invoices to homeowners. The previous board spent hours sending out invoices. The account also links perfectly with our bank account so reconciling all income and expenses is simple and quick. Reporting meets our basic needs and allows me to share information with our board members automatically every month. The UI is very intuitive and pleasing as well. Overall, the cost/benefit of the app is perfect for our needs.
"Love the app. The software has ways been my favorite to use for my small business. The app is such a big plus to compliment the web version. Helps me keep up with everything I need while traveling 
Awesome"
Good deal. I appreciate this app. It helps me keep an eye on my business so I'm not always sitting in front of my laptop.
Not like the online version. The app is alright. Missing a lot of feature (if you compare it to the online version) but if they come up with a solution and have them on the app version I would rate it 5 stars.
Beautiful, so simple.. Really great app.
Very Handy Little App. As said in other reviews it is a little different from the computer version but it is such an easy way for me to do my invoices on the go! It's all set to go and it tracks all of my invoices and sends me reminds of unpaid one too! Great little helper!
Quickbooks Online : almost there.... Ideally, any app should be as close as possible to the desktop experience. Whilst still lacking in key features & reports, this app wins easily when compared to its contemporaries. The app is very stable and permit multi file access, which is very useful. Basic tasks such invoicing & reciting can be performed (and emailed) etc, but bank rec nciliations can't be reconciled as yet. So 4/5 from me...
Simple and efficient. This makes invoicing on the go so simple. I love that it syncs with my computer and I can take a photo of receipts and it adds them to my expenses. Very convenient
Handy invoicing tool when out and about. I use this app predominantly to invoice as I travel a lot in my job. It has been a bit of a game changer to be able to produce professional invoices on the go. And amazing to keep track of payments.
Very user friendly. Great app for on the go people
Love it. Amazing I don't know what I would do without this app.
Great app. Quickbooks online allows me to work from home easily. I have only had some minor hiccups but nothing to give it a bad review. Very pleased with the software.
Horrible application with brutal customer service. I am a current customer with this product and it is complete crap. The office is NEVER open, they cancel your service with no follow up, their online instructions are so far out of date that it is impossible to make corrections...it is an absolute waste of money and time. Grow up and fire all of the management staff, they are completely lost in the high tech aspect of life but they have lost the high touch. They are completely out to lunch. Idiots
Works good. Easy to use.. It's really easy to file expenses with this. That's all I really need a mobile accounting app for.
"Love syncing real time data in the cloud. In February of 2014 I implemented QBO for a client. I loved it so much and could see immediately the benefits of working in the cloud with my clients. The greatest benefit is that all key stakeholders (bookkeeper, year-end Accountant and client) are able to work in real time. We can see immediately how profitable yesterday was or even this morning! The payroll module is great. Each client is responsible for some part of their bookkeeping story. For many I have them tabulate and run their own payroll. It really is so simple with this app and saves them tying up my schedule with this repetitive task. I’m just a click away if they have made a mistake or just want me to “check in to see if they did their assigned task OK”. Since 2014 I have converted my entire clientele to Quickbooks Online! Every single one. I believe in the product so much that my entire practice is 100% Quickbooks Online. My practice is able to operate more efficiently by taking the Cloud leap and we are able to connect with our clients better. The bookkeeping family relationship has intensified. Thank you Intuit! You have made my life simpler. I can’t wait to see what you amaze me with next!

"Great app. Great app for busy people! 
This is really useful for trades people and consultants. Highly recommend, super easy to use"
"Just Downloaded the App Today. So I just loaded the app & here is my first impression before you purchase.
Simple way to get invoices to clients ASAP from your mobile device. We are always on the go so needed to see if this would work. First invoice looked great but the business address did not come over on the invoice even though it was entered. It seems after reading a few reviews that addresses don't import over onto the invoices? This is inconvenient to say the least. I'll give it 25 days & see if we like it. Wanted you to know before you bought it."
"Owner. Intuit has lost me with their latest products.  This is completely useless to me.  I wanted to enter checks we write as we go.  Seems simple enough.  The system wants to use the next check number which is unnecessary, especially since it can't find it in my data and won't accept the one I entered.  It gives me an error an tells me to do it through my computer which ""should solve the problem"".   So tell me again what I am gaining by having this piece of crap app?  Useless!"
Love this app. Awesome
Love it. Best app ever
Love quickbooks app. Very easy to use definitely recommend
Great App!!. I love it! This program has totally transformed our family business!!
Best app for my business!. I already have invoicesASAP, now I have it's companion, Quickbooks! Love how they sync and work together to help me understand my finances!
Best APP. Amazing!
Most impressive business app I've used in a long time. I use QB online everyday and usually there is some functionality degradation from desktop to mobile. I have yet to find any crippling loss of functionality with this app. If you love the new QB online this app goes hand in hand with your on-the-go accounting needs. Highly recommended.
Life Saver!. I absolutely love this app. When I first started out and I didn't have that many funds in the bank, this was one expense I didn't even have to overthink. After using QuickBooks Online app for only a week I knew I could never go back to organizing my finances on my own. I use it every single day!
Expenses not current. Somehow my current expenses are not listed under my checking account. The last entry is for 2012. Please update. Thanks
Awesome App. Great app to compliment the web based quickbooks program, made my accounting tracking and  hassles a thing of the past.
"Impressed. I put off upgrading to online version after using Quickbooks pro for five years, struggling to enter online direct debit expenses and payments. Online version makes entering data easy and efficient. Such a time saver for me. Well done intuit! 
Definitely worth the monthly subscription fee."
I love it!. Great app haven't seen anything better.
Good but not great. It NEEDS to have form customization like the desktop version.  Intuit needs to realize existing customers are switching over for its convenience too.  Therefore, they cannot omit features that effect the end look of invoices and estimates.  Especially when the customization options are so limited as to even being able include additional images.
Time saver & ease of access. If you don't have the app for your small business account already, well you better just click download now! It saves me hours of computer time each week and my clients get the necessary paperwork even when I'm on a job site working. Invoicing and inputting receipts has never been easier!
"Getting there. QB online is a great service, but slightly glitchy. 

  The app however just gives me an error message when I tap ""Banking"". That's the most important feature!!!"
Better than Sage. With a properly functioning mobile app, Square integration & receipt/expense management, 10 times easier to use than Sage(Simply Accounting)
Awesome business app. Real  time saver with awesome easy features that makes book keeping a breeze.
Quickbooks Online App. Although I do like Quickbooks Online, the mobile app version is HORRIBLE.  I downloaded and logged in and it did give me my balance sheet, but said I had no expenses, I could not find a way to put in a journal entry and other reports showed zeros as well.  I deleted it from my iPad and will just use the non-app version ( which you need google chrome vs safari to work properly- not a big deal but a bit odd).
Excellent. You can do so much with just this app - absolute game changer. Love it.
Very good. The app works well I would say that it is easier to use and better than Quick Books Online. (I do understand that the online has to do more) It links well with online and being able to photograph receipts and invoices and applying them to the relevant file is great.
Loving it. Been hunting for a simple app for managing the finances of my farm business. This helps me with capturing and analysis of all my expenses and income. The reporting is also amazing. I also love the fact that I can even get more stats and reports via the web. Amazing stuff. Already introduced it to quite a number of industry colleagues. Truly an amazing app
Easy and Convenient. I own a construction business, and have grown very fond of this app. It's really convenient to use the app to maintain our books on the go. My husband and I wear many hats in our business. Our time is precious, but Quickbooks Online helps free up some of that time with its ease of use.
"Helpful for service business. This app is Gooding that it adds some features that the Quickbooks companion for desktop app lacked. Like receiving payments for invoices and doing some basic reports. The down side is that if you have more than one company you are required to pay for each company separately for qbo. Qbo also has less tools than the desktop version. 

I have a service business and use this app I the field. Very helpful for creating and sending estimates, invoices, and sales receipts on the spot."
Excellent. Intuit quick books is an extremely important account program which my business is built around, and the application is the cherry on top, enabling me to complete accounting on the go. Absolutely excellent application.
"Good Functionality; could use a few more of the online features. Very easy app, works very nicely in the field. 

Would be more handy if the iPhone or iPad versions allowed for time tracking or payroll functions."
Contractor couldn't live without it. I use this app every time I bill a client and can provide him with an accurate, complete invoice and receive payment on the spot. Importing customers from my contacts is a great help. A must-have complement to Quickbooks online.
Great app!. I'm in love with this app, too bad that the ProAdvisor app  doesn't work as sharp (doesn't work at all).
Time saver!. This app has decreased the amount of time I used to spend in the office by 75%! It's intuitive and the support is fantastic. A great investment for my small business. Invoicing and quoting should never be a burden.
Nonexistent customer service. I have had some very poor experiences with QuickBooks desktop versions. The product itself is generally fairly good but customer service is ridiculous. So when I was looking for a accounting program to use on the smart phones, I was reluctant to go with QuickBooks after using three different companies and having a good experience with Fresh-books. In the end I only went with QuickBooks because the they were the only ones who had a Canadian payroll system available. So far a horrible mistake. I signed on with my credit card to turn my trial basis into a regular subscription, complete with printed receipt. Now it is still not giving me what I paid for and warning me that my trial period is about to end. That in itself is annoying, but trying to actually contact a real person in their customer service is virtually impossible. In comparison to when they were trying to get me to sign on and were phoning me personally.  So my recommendation is to go with anybody but QuickBooks. Oh, and if there's an actual person who works for QuickBooks, my invoice number is B1–7383544. In case you actually want to fix this disaster.
Must have. This app is an all around life saver for the on the go business minded person! Freedom to work on the go!! Absolutely love it!
"It doesn't synchronize. The app is totally unusable. It doesn't synchronize Customers and Supplier and the transaction with those missing from the list result as incomplete. Tried also to dis install and reinstall: same story. 
On top of this it must also said that the assistance is unresponsive, many days and repeated enquiries to finally  get emails full of irritating smileys and useless answers like ""We are constantly improving the apps to serve our mobile customers""."
Awesome. I've been using Quickbooks for years the online and mobile App is the only way to go
No time tracking. The only reason I use QBO is for time tracking and the app can not add entires to time tracking nor edit them, nor add or edit employees. This is the ultimate functionality I need in order to work remotely or else I have to write it all down on paper then manually enter when I get home. All that extra work defeats the purpose of having a computing system that i pay for do this for me. Works great at home but I am chained to my desk!
Oakes Firewood LLC. Great App! Love it! Easy and fast to use. Good Job!
Nice. Nice app but when you have to select item then you have to type whole item code, before update you just type last 2-3 words and it's there.
Best accounting app. Perfect for any small business. Never had any problem, never crashes. Only need more invoicing templates.
GARY STANTON. This app means I can seem to know what I am doing, it actually works for me.
Amazing improvement in Technology. We operate a wholesale division, a small brick & motor store, and two large e-commerce platforms that we participate in. QuickBooks online and the combination of some of the apps will completely revolutionize how we process our accounting and retail transactions. Saving us countless hours of time and increasing productivity
Outstanding. I love the new QuickBooks app it allows me to invoice and estimate my customers in a snap it also allows me to bring the point of sale in the home credit card processing is very easy also my favorite feature is that I am able to transfer my contacts into my QuickBooks customer list with the press of a button
Very nice.. Very helpful considering that is cloud app. I work with it everywhere a go.
INTUIT IS TOO BIG TO CARE ABOUT QUALITY.. Hi intuit, you are a multi million dollar company. Why is it that importing a contact from my iPad customer list into an invoice cannot pull the address with it?  This is just one of many clunky problems that companies with much less resource would identify and solve. You think you are so large and we need you so much that putting out an app like this will go up noticed. I have been using QB online since it began. Your first iPad app was laughable and this one just makes me angry I have held onto my subscrition for so long. Now that there are competitors it's going to take more than lowering your rate to $19/mo to keep this customer. It's insulting.
No multi currency  = useless. I enabled multicurrency on my Quickbooks account, which you can not revert once applied.  And now i find that when I log into the app, it won’t show transactions or customers that use anything other than my base currency.  USELESS.  Utterly useless.
User friendly.  Works great!. Great app for running a small business.  Easy to use for estimates, invoicing, accounts receivable, etc.  Can't wait to integrate it with our payroll to make billing for labor even easier.  Highly recommend.
Make fit 6 Plus. Can you make this app fit the 6 and the 6 plus? That would be cool!
No Time Tracking. Our organization relies heavily on the time tracking functionality and the app does not support this. When you try to access the site to do the time tracking you are forced to use the mobile version of the site which does not support time tracking either.
Great App. In love with this app but I need more options. Is there a way I can restrict access to estimates only to other users?
Keeps Crashing!. I've been a Quickbooks desktop customer for many years and was forced to make the switch to online when Intuit stopped servicing their mobile desktop app.  Now, with this new platform the app on an iPhone 6 is not functioning.  I've deleted and re-downloaded, have performed hard resets on the phone, and have tried every other trick I know, but it Continually crashes. The app is useless on my iPhone.  Hopefully they will correct this issue soon because it is a real pain attempting to perform any work in the field, and converting over to Online was a big deal, for us anyway.   For those thinking about making the switch who also use payroll, we were forced to manually enter all payroll history for every employee into Online's database.  Took forever.
Great software. I have come to really like quick books online. Quoting, invoicing, reports and my personal favourite... it links with your bank account to automate expense inputs. You set the rules once and the next time a similar transaction appears in your linked bank account it automatically categorises the transaction for you, just hit 'add'. Saves me so much time and effort and to me it's fast becoming a business tool I simply wouldn't be without.
Great app. Great app Quick and easy to make estimates and invoices. would like for there to be more customization such as adding business information to show on them rather than just email address however overall is a great app very happy with it.
Great app. Works very well with the iPad. Allows you to make invoices and notes on the go. Much better being cloud based than PC based. It costs more but it definitely worth it when it comes to the convenience.
Not ready. App keeps crashing, features aren't loading... Ever.  Balance sheet, profit loss... They error every time.  Hasn't worked once.  App is not ready for release.
"Great app! Very easy to understand and use!. Great app! Very easy to understand and use! 

David Lorea Farrington"
"A really great app. Quick books is pretty much all you could ask for when running a small business. It's online so all information and invoices are accessible from any device with Internet. Great customisable options.
Only minor thing is its interface is slightly more complex than other apps/programs but once you know your way around your fine."
Terrible customer support. Customer service for payroll is terrible.  The say my problem is resolved, but my payroll us locked pending me contacting them.  Chat rep. Says they will call, but they don't.  Waited online for two hours on chat and they never answered.  Went fro 18 in line to 3 and nothing beyond that.  This morning I entered chat asking for help and as told he couldn't help me.  Gave me a phone number to call and logged off.  Just finished an hour on hold.  The customer service doesn't even ruse to the level of terrible.  I need a new service.
Functional and Practical. Love the cloud software, love the app.
Awesome. This app is awesome quick efficient and mobile please consider for small business accounting needs
Owner. Terrible , there is no estimates workable , also 85 % of desktop does not show I have been in desktop for years and wanted to use both not any more
So far so good, but.... I just signed up for the subscription.  Still setting everything up and evaluating the features, but the one thing I notice it is lacking right out of the gate is Touch ID support. The use of the passcode is a great shortcut, but adding Touch ID would make a very helpful addition!
Good App. This app is a good. We like it on iPad and iPhone too. Thanks QB!
I like it. Best app for your small business
Don't believe the negative reviews!!. I think the application is a huge time saver. Works great on my iPad Air  2.  I  strongly recommend this app!  It's like getting a full time bookkeeper for only $30 per month!  I like having my business records semi-automated in the cloud. Intuit offers a 30 day trial. Why not just try before you buy? That's what I did and I haven't been disappointed.
Perfect for a small consulting firm. This app is everything I need for my consulting firm. Easy to use and easy to keep track of expenses on the road.  Invoicing is a breeze. Love the data in the cloud.  Take a pic and throw away those receipts!  Works flawlessly between my Mac, iPad and iPhone.  No complaints whatsoever.
Great little app. I do emergency call outs and can log in and keep up with my book keeping on the fly.
Breathtaking!!. Wow this is an incredible app. I have searched for personal finance software for a long time and it has been a major headache. using Quickbooks online  is amazing.  If they continue to add features to the online product to rival their desktop version I recommend they move completely to the cloud!! So good.
Can't match bank transactions reliably. The only reason I use this app is to match bank transactions when I have some 'down' minutes. Lately, they keep getting kicked back to me, so I have to match them on my PC anyway. Also, you don't have access to both memo and description, so your notes don't appear in reports if you add the transaction though a bank connection.
Works well enough. I'm not in love with using apps on my phone, so it was confusing to re-learn the app after the recent update.  I can't seem to find some things on the phone app that I can easily find on a laptop.
Cannot reconcile bank accounts on app. Cannot reconcile on the app. Completely useless to me as the bookkeeper.
"Limited in Ipad. will not allow the entering of purchases on account from suppliers when using the Ipad app.
seems to be more cash based, unlike the version you log on with you pc or imac."
Great accounting package. Love the mobile apps!
Great app. It's quick and easy to learn. Prefect for me.
Great. Great app
Couldn't ask for more!. Everything you need, intuitive and great access with mobile apps!
Love QB Online. Most time saving, user-friendly, awesome, efficient app EVER!!!!
"Keeping my desktop version. I have used quickbooks since 2001. So I love quickbooks. Save a lot of time on accounting side of the business. 
When I was making the move from a Windows based laptop to Apple (ipad) for my mobile business, I found this app to be very low on features. Simple tasks like sorting a list, inventory, and reports were poor and lacking. 
The online monthly subscription is a joke. You have to opt for a more expensive subscription to gain features that still pale to the desktop version. Long term, it's cheaper to buy the real program. Plus all your personal financial and customers info won't be out in the web as much. 
The web version of this app does not inner exact well with a iOS web browser. 
That being said, I bought a windows based tablet and install my desktop quickbooks. I have no monthly fee and I have all my info not floating around on the web."
Jackrabbit. Enjoy using this app. Would like to see more options on bank balances
Good app. No complains
"Headed in the right direction, but needs work.. This is a good app, with many great features. I use it to write quick estimates, or edit estimates written from my computer. 
However, there are a two major drawbacks 
1. Multi user doesn't seem to be an option. Im hanging in for now to see what happens but if this isn't changed soon then I will be looking elsewhere. 
2. They don't seem to understand who the app is made for. Is this for tue small business owner, accounting, felid opps? 
I can write estimates from it so that seems like accounting is out, but not all the banking is available via mobile either. That leads me to say this app for the small, one person, business. I plan on growing...so what do I do then?
Please don't get me wrong this is a good app. I just feel they need to get a focus group on this app, and figure it out. I would like to see multi user support, with areas that each user can be limited to using. Basically management, field, accounting, and even inventory to some degree could be using this system."
Splendid. Excellent to have such an app to complete all needs and it's on mobile too
Bookkeepers or better only! Too much info available to users.. This app would allow a salesman taking orders to view way too much information. It's nice that it integrates with the QBO program, but what am I supposed to do about salesmen that only need to check inventory and write orders? Surely they should be excluded from the company books! Very disappointed in the time I wasted talking to intuit salespeople who materially misrepresent the functionality of the program
Good app. This is a good app, I'm doing the 30 day trial , for me it's just let down slightly by the customisation of the estimate and invoice forms like most apps of this kind it seems  geared more towards the business that charges an hourly rate or sells quantities of items but you can customise them to a certain degree. also, although it's not too clear how but you can add customers from your iPhone contacts and as I discovered you can connect it to your google contacts on the Mac / PC which is good especially if you sync your Mac contacts with googles, it seems pretty straightforward to use and I think monthly cost quite reasonable.
Very helpful. This app is great and so good to use while on the go to do invoices. Would love if i could match up invoices to what's been received in the bank.
Great app!. An awesome compliment to the web version. Addition of Balance Sheet would be beneficial. Cheers!
Quickbooks Online Mobile. Wonderful app to allow access from anywhere, from any device. I especially appreciate the increased usability from mobile devices. I did not have to lug my laptop on vacation, but was still able to stay in touch, and function as needed.
Incredible. This is an incredible application. If you're looking to intuitively streamline your business this is definitely the app for you!
Great so far!. I am really glad we went with QuickBooks Online, as I love this app!  Being able to pull up any and all financial information as well as build and email estimates and invoices on the go is crucial to our business!  Thank you Intuit!
"Great app. Helps make my business more efficient. This is a great tool for small business owners who are on the go. Making invoices, estimates and tracking expenses with my iPhone helps make things much more efficient. 

I wish there was a way to track HST, and generate simple reports within the app. Automatic text recognition would be an awesome feature as well."
Good basic functionality.. This app gives good basic information. Can be improved by bringing more functionality to iPhone app. Like bank transaction matching. Etc
Great app for independent contractors. QB helps me stay on top of my invoices and keeps me organized.
"Intuit. Great App
Will be nice when we can scan bar codes on receipts"
"Nice app that works well!!. Works well, well thought out and presented. 

Helps me day to day for sure!!"
"Need more work. I have made quite a few recommendations over the last 6 months, and unfortunately none have been implemented or responded too. 

1. Second email address option for various company contacts for invoices and estimates. 
Often they are separate departments with different contacts. 

2. Multi company compatible for businesses dba with parent companies. 

3. Input database and previous lists or account options beyond the square app. Omg! 

4. Not Compatible with other programs. With no interface to use any other program like all of their non web based products do... So everything would be double entered if your company uses an internal software for their business. And decided to go web based with quickbooks.."
Crap. This app is a piece of crap my dad got it on our computer.When u scroll it goes the opposite way and there is also a bunch of other crap. I would. It recommend getting this
Great app!. I love this app for the ease of use for my clients and me.
App is lacking. While I really like the online version of quickbooks on the desktop, the online app is definitely lacking.  I can't check my check register.  No reports.  Just not useful without this.
Quick books makes my life easier!. Doing estimates and sending invoices is easier then ever!
"Few fixes. overall great. Great app. Only things I'd like to see are invoice signatures like on the iPad and to be able to search sub products by the parent product name like on the pc version. Ie our product ""pale ale"" sub product ""1/2bbl""doesn't show up in the search for pale ale"
Awesome. This app is great and extremely helpful with my small business. It saves a lot of time and work. Not only do I find it very resourceful but it's easy to use. Customizing my invoices and estimates is probably the best part of the application aside from it allowing me to check my profit and loss. I recommend this app to any user, especially a business owner.
Quickbooks. It's a great app.
App is limited on what your can do. The app would be more helpful if I could categorize transactions while on the go among many other features the desktop version offers.
Need Packing Slip Option. Add the option to send packing slips from the mobile app
Nice App!. Suits my needs...
Un most para las empresas. la mejor app y software para llevar la contabilidad de tu empresa. Sencillo y en línea! te calcula todo limpio y sin problemas
Works well. This app is far better than the desk top program for Mac. As a small business I have many more things I need to do than spending time learning a program.  It allows easy access for my accountant and mobility for me!
How did I run my business without it?. I do half my estimates and invoices on the go with this app. Saves me so much time!
"Elecsmart Electricians London. I have used the online version but now prefer the app as it seems to be more stable.

Worth the money and great for a progressive company!"
AMMMMAZING. This app is great !! Only thing missing is appointment capabilities other than that the app is perfect.Everything I need out of the office.
Excellent. Best app to run your business
Need iPad update. The iPad app should be as capable as the desktop version. When are we going to see this? iPhone app is pretty stout but the iPad app needs update and soon.
"Until the App matches the Web Aplication. I like the idea of QBO especially the mobile app. It is innovative. Helpful for me as a not for profit operative.

The iOS app is nothing however until it matches what you can accomplish on the browser. 

Going forward, the accomplishment of that determines if I will continue to use the service.

I am also put off with the fact that I cannot integrate my banks in Nigeria.

If Quickteller perfects its act with the development of Retail App of late, banking integration might be the reason why I will stop using the service in the future.
 
For now the app frustrates me as I will prefer to do all that I need to in app and not through browser, the mobile idea is also defeated with the limitations of the web app on mobile browser."
Great app but....:.. Good application but we need features that enable generation of reports
Couldn't ask for more. Vary good app with great integration with cloud web service. I have been using this app along with desktop cloud version with my business for little more then a year now and find it vary useful and the app tops it off being on the road with no access to computer as long as they continue to upgrade and offer quickbooks online with app i will subscribe
Owner small massage therapy business. For the small amount of paperwork my business requires, this app is perfect.  I can input info before leaving the office and it prompts me with appropriate questions to categorize items properly.  Very user friendly and convenient.
Excellent App for Small Business!. I have to say that I have ised several versions of Quickbooks however; the Quickbooks Online is the best yet!
Very easy and great!. I'm not a accountant but I found this app and the software great
Good. It works really well, one thing that would be nice in the app is an option to batch email invoices, or make an option to automatically email after you create each invoice
"Working good for me.. The QB online is what I have started with. I use the app and PC to access it. So far so good. I also notice how often QB's is updating and I have watched this version evolve over the last 3 years. 
My bookkeepers and Accountant like it for my needs. 
I do not use payroll.
Every time I have called customer service I have had attentive reps."
Horrible. What a joke. All I want to do is be able to go to my online account. Every time I try to do that it pops up to install this app. I did. Now when I go in nothing looks the same or works the same. You would think I would be able to go online without this horrible app. I would give it zero stars if I could.
Great App!. Wonderful App.
Good app. Good app, lacking functionality but this will improve in time.
"Works Well!. This app does what I need it to do. I'm an electrical  contractor and I'm able to do all the bookkeeping myself with just a little help.
I like the ability to make invoices on the job, enter receipts at stores, and view the status of customers.
I would suggest this for any small business. I use the basic service ($10/mth) and it's well worth it."
Great App. Great App that does all it promises to do. So handy for getting out quotes when away from the office.
"Not as good as I thought, but better. I tried a few apps/softwares, but I stopped here. The downside is that it makes you a little bit lazy and have more free time, so people think you are not doing a big job? Say if I can get all;
1. All expenses with their attachments organised in one place
2. All invoices and their attachments
3. All bank accounts - even personal accounts to allocate transactions relate to business - and without a need to ""data entry""
4. My BAS can be done in a few min
5. My chart of accounts can be amended as I go from everywhere
6. Plenty of reports are ready at any time
7. One look at one graph, I can know what's up.

Plenty of other features and I like this app"
Owner. I bought my basic subscription through the Apple Store and now I want to upgrade to essentials has anyone done or knows how to do this
Love it. But one thing is missing. I have a lot of customers who pre-pay for their dog waking services. Trying to roll over store credit is more difficult than anticipated with this app. That is the one and only negative I have. Not big enough of an issue to make me not want to use this app. I love it overall.
"Great app for accounting on the go!. I don't know why people are disappointed in this app-- it's an app, not an entire accounting software. Plus it's free! 

I love this app. I can create, manage & send invoices on the go. That's all I need to do. It has a simple interface. Kudos to QB."
Okay. I like that I can use this mobile app for entering expenses, but I really need to watch cash flow...please add the ability to view account balances within the app!
Perfect!. Great app with all the functionality I need to take care of business. I can do much of my books on the go and not let things pile up. Love this app!
So so.. While intuit has made many improvements in the last few years the iPhone app is virtually useless. The iPad version is a slight improvement but neither app allow access to the most commonly accessed information. Oh well.
I love this app. I love been able to do my work on the go, and quick book helps me do that
Owner. Its great doing my acct on the go, staying current.    Great mobile app adding more features all the the time!
President. This is a great app to use wherever you are. It actually works better on my iPad better than my computer in my office. I completely recommend this app and quick books for any small business owner. Love it!!!
Works great. Business on the go! I wish there where a few more options, but all in all great app.
Joke. Quickbooks online is almost like a bad joke compared to QuickBooks desktop. The app is even worse and does not even work properly so that it is reliable and can be used. So QuickBooks online has many features missing from QuickBooks desktop and the QuickBooks mobile app is missing even more features from QuickBooks online. So if you are a previous QuickBooks user prepared to be seriously disappointed. You would think that if Intuit does not want bad reviews for QuickBooks online, they would warn everyone that it is not even close to being a desktop version, but they don't warn you. So okay tension to all these bad reviews, because they're all true.
I Love it!!!!. I've been a real estate agent for over ten years & keep my expenses & income on spreadsheets, what a pain. This is awesome! I do wish however I could keep my mileage in this app also, do that & I'll give you six stars.
Great App. This app has been a big help. Flawless!!!!
Not so good. I use the web based app and love it. The iPad & iPhone app is not all that. I think QB should include a dashboard for the iPhone & iPad.
Awesome. Love this app!! So easy and quick to use
Great app. Great app links well details on the laptop. Can create  invoices on as soon as the job is finished.
Great app. I use this everyday! Wouldn't want any other invoicing company
Lacks Important Functionality. This app doesn’t let you see current bank balances for any account, which is a major oversight. Intuit: Please add this feature.
Very easy and convenient!. I love having the mobile app. It makes it easy to enter transactions on the spot without having to stop and open up my computer to login.
"Ridiculous!. I can't believe that I pay $20 a month for an app that won't even let me ""break out"" deposits!!! I am treasurer for a non profit organization and this is crazy! My $ could, and will be spent elsewhere."
Billable expenses. New website and app are nice, except on IOS cannot specify expense as billable....why? No clue.
Very useful!. This app allows me to send clients a sales receipt as soon as they hand me the cash, invaluable when visiting clients.
NOT GOOD!. I would expect that a company like QB will hire a high end software company to design their online website & mobile app. Whoever did this is absolutly no good!
Very Intuitive. Incredible app. I find it easier to use than the desk top version.
"Not all data available on all platforms.. The product is pretty good but there’s an issue with the latest iPhone version.  One is able to enter expenses as either expenses or bills.  On the iPhone, you cannot see any of the bills - this means for some of my suppliers, on the iPhone it shows I have zero purchases.  On the online version, everything displays correctly.

Show us that you’re serious about your product by ensuring better quality control - how could such a glaring omission pass through QA?!?"
Excellent program. I am so impressed with this new app, it is very easy to use and very helpful for my construction business. I don't even have to go to the office to make an invoice I can do it right in my truck on my phone and send it. I can check on expenses... It's a breeze and worth the time to get to know this app and online program.
Awesome. This app is so good I'm so glad I have it I would be lost with out it
Good app It works. only early days, Moved from Reckon Hosted, so far seems to be the best move.  wish I did it earlier.
Fantastic. I love this app! It's very useful
"Still have to use the old app. Had to reinstall the old app cause I couldn't create new clients from my contacts with the ""new"" one. Even deleted, reinstalled thinking I may have over look a pop up window.  The old version still accesses my contact list so I'll use that one till the bitter end."
Awesome. This app is perfect for all users. I haven't found an instance where this app can not be used. It lets the boss and employee work together from anywhere. It can only get better with time. If u need an invoice or quote program. This is your app. (+more). A lot less paper work that's for sure. 😉
Simply, Beautifully... Brilliant. I've no need to log in via the laptop until the end of the month... The fact that I can capture, create but also review my expenses, my P&L and notes is simply brilliant.
Can't attach images or accept signatures. Really!!?? So many features I would have expected. Track expenses, milage, accept signatures.
"Promised so much, delivered so little. As a non-accountant I was excited to use an app that made accounting simple.  Unfortunately it bogged down from the beginning.  Two major problems:
 
First, Apple does not play well with Intuit.  The web app (Intuit's quickbooks online) and mobile app (from Apple) are not really compatible.  The advertising is misleading.

Second, this app is only in Beta and missing basic functionality.  I could not enter invoices from vendors to get an Accounts Payable register.  You can only enter invoices after they are paid by cash or credit card.  There is no facilitation for credit purchases.

After wasting two days on this disappointing app, I gave up.  My 50 years of experience running several corporations tells me this was a ""nice try but no cigar"" for Intuit!"
Quickbooks App. Great app. Really useful.
Great job. Great app! Great for my graphic design business!
Best app I use. I have been using this app for about 30 days now and it dose everything I need it to do on the go. The only thing I would add is the ability to make a deposit in quickbooks via the app. If you use quickbooks you should have this app
Disappointed.. We have been quickbooks users since its inception. It's seems through the years they continually try to find a way to get more money out of your business. We have been content using enterprise as a desktop version and my field techs were using quickbooks mobile. Luckily there was an integration or sync capability between the two. Low and behold quickbooks decides to delete the mobile app and I am left with no way to do field transactions. We were told about qbo and thought we would give it a try. I think it's great for mobile users, but for accounting, especially after using enterprise, it's a joke. Not only do you have to have a separate merchant account, and a separate payroll app there is no integration to any desktop version. Truly a sad move for intuit. If integration or sync was available this would be great. So now I'm left doing double entry from what my field techs do during the day on qbo to entry in enterprise.
Great app!!. Great app
Love it. Huge time saver to photo and input expenses.  I can't imagine my life without it.
Great App. It sure is nice to be able to do things anytime anywhere.
Flawed. I am going to reinstall the old app. The new app will not allow me to add a customer from my phone's contact list.
"Just fine for a small business. If you are looking to get up and running quickly, then this will do just fine.

The subscription is a little on the high side compared to Sage's offering, but Sage is a lot more difficult to use."
Great App. Great App
"Quickbooks app. Great app makes my pool service business invoicing a breeze. I'm able to invoice on the job rather than back at the office. The time I save pays for the app every month. The only thing I'd like to see is either automatic statements or be able to send statements from my phone.
Thanks intuit"
"QUICK BOOKS. The best app ever, easy to use, never had an issue that could not be easily resolved. 
I run 2 NYC businesses and mostly on the run."
Does the job. Very effective app to make small business owners productive.
Highly functional for an app. Unlike other folks I find that I can get the majority of what I need to accomplish for day-to-day business done on this app. Very user friendly.
A very useful application. I find it quite convenient to be able to enter expenses from my phone and include photographs receipts when I am on the go. I use QuickBooks online and although the app is limited in some respects as far as functionality goes the limits that other reviewers have discussed has not affected my business at all. I like it a lot :-)
Awesome. I'm a carpenter. This app changed my life, and actually gave me back a lot of my life. Estimates done before you leave your customers house? How cool is that.
Great App. We use everyday for our company
"Game Changer For Our Business!!!!!. We had been using Excel go all of our estimates and invoicing, which as many people know can be a real pain when managing multiple clients at a time.. I saw the software version at Costco and read through the features and benefits and thought ""hmmm, this might be something we need.."" From the moment I signed up I was blown away by the ease of use and the simplicity of its management capabilities!!! I LOVE QUICK BOOKS and I don't know where'd we'd be without it!!!"
Decent but need more work. When using the Online version, this iOS version looks incomplete. It is useful to see some general information, but for analysis you need more details and this app does not show them.
Great. Helps me track all of my business needs from estimates and invoicing to financing. Great app!
Great app. Great app and great accounting platform.. I switched from using invoice2go and MYOB on PC. It's so much easier not having to re enter invoices twice. I love the bank syncing which is accessible from the iPad app. It lets you sign invoices and estimates. It was a little leggy but now it's upgraded it downloads the data to the app so it's much faster now. Quickbooks are making lots of changes and keep developing the platform for the better. It's very intuitive and a joy to use. It's obviously not as comprehensive as the full install version but it's enough for small / medium business. It has a separate add on for payroll which I have not used yet but I assume it will work well.
"Great App. I've been a QB user since the early 90's.  The app keeps getting better with greater functionally. I'm confident that all functions will be available on the app in future release. 
I use this app all day to create estimates and bill customers. It's great."
Good app. Overall this is a good app, would be nice to have more features such as gp% per job or integration with credit card payment
I Spoke, They Listnened. I have had my fair share of frustrations with Intuit and when they send out questionnaires I answer them and my biggest complaint was no access to a P&L which is now apart of the app. It's perfect for what I use it for and there's nothing like creating invoices and getting paid on the go. Great update and thanks for listening.
A great experience. This new update has just all the features required from this app and more. Not just do you guys listen but act as well. Kudos. The best cloud service, that can be.
Business changer. Changing the way I do business. My first sale paid for the app.
"Latest upgrade is a disgrace. I have never written a negative review of an upgrade, but the latest version of this app made a great app totally useless. You can no longer receive invoices or reconcile bank balances. 

Do yourself a favor and delete the Quickbooks app rather than ""upgrade."" The mobile website is more useful than the app."
Owner. I actually have never written a review for an app, and I've had an every iphone since the 3GS, I read the first review for this app and was so disgusted at the panning I just had to write one in support. I have a small business and use this EVERY DAY! It's great, well designed and very user friendly. I run a carpet cleaning company and run basically every part of my business with this app.
"Easy. I have found this app very easy to use. 

Being able to tap into your invoicing system when out on a job.

It enables me to issue an invoice same moment the job is finished and emailed to my customer stood in front of me, that way my customer has a paperless invoice and can pay you right away. 

Saves time!"
What a joke. Downloaded this app so I could pay employees and taxes on time without having to be at my computer and I can't do either, I have to be in front of my computer to do both. I don't understand why it's not allowed on mobile app.
Where the banking. I want to accept transactions while I sit in bed, this app is far from useful without that capability, come on intuit, make the app complete.  As is, a total let down!
Discontinued...... Of course vie been using this app for over a year now and has been super handy. Lately been having issues so I called QB only to be told it's discontinued now. Wonderful.
QB online. Absolutely perfect I've been using the qb app and this is exactly what I've been looking for I'm a painting contractor and this app is going to make it easy for me. If you are a qb user it's a must get
Don't believe the hype. This app is practically worthless. All important actions require you to be on the website. I need to be able to invoice, payroll, and do taxes from the app as I am hardly with my computer.
Fix Crash. My QuickBooks app was crashing on my iPad 3, after I did the upgrade. Press and hold the app icon and uninstall it. Then, download it again. It now works.
Quickbooks Mobile app. Awesome app that let's me quickly and easily access and review what is happening at my business especially when I am away!
Fix the problem. GOOD APP, but fix Unicode problem!!! If you are using Russian language in the app, making an invoice after you send it to the client or just previewing it - if your invoice in Russian than all you can see is ?????? ??? ????? It's definitely UNICODE  problem!!!
Minor flaws happy with product. When adding a note to a customer file ie invoice or estimate the app seems to struggle to keep up...  Typing is really slow and sluggish   iPad retina third-generation
App crashes ughhh. App crashes after you sign in. Please fix!
Great app for any small business. This is a well polished app with regular updates and new features being added everyday. *Credit card transactions are incredibly simple with the intuit gopayment integration. Great job on the app guys keep up the good work!
Awesome. This is a great App it's really easy to use with seamless integration with my desktop version. The response has been consistently fast when you process transactions, highly recommend !
"Finally!!!. Finally, Quickbooks has catered for the truly 'on the go'...and the app is really good too!

Well done Intuit!

Just need to make this drive down the cost now and then we would really be goo :)"
Love it. We love Quickbooks online, we would be lost without this app and online access. Thanks Quickbooks :)
"A small business gem. For a small business with a limited budget, this is the best.  
I needed to prepare estimates/quotations to sell products.  I already have 450 items in the system and will be adding 2,500 more, for a total of 3,000 possible configurations of our products.  I can estimate using my computer, iPad or phone.  I know it will be accurate and professional.  (I'd like to print estimates with no itemized pricing for some customers, and also print with line item discounted prices shown, but maybe that will come with time).
With time I will upgrade to the next level so that I can hand the estimating over to staff.  
I believe that because Intuit made QuickBooks Online available to me and my small business that our company will migrate our whole business over to QBO over time. 
Thank you Intuit."
A waste of time. No payroll functions. A big area to not include. I still need my computer to pay staff. Missing other features. Should be a full functioning app.
"On line program is great, but the App is limited.. Intuit is great and well worth the money.  But the App is worthless.  There is little you can do.  

You should be able to do everything you can do on a desktop, otherwise what is the point?  

Sad, but I would still recommend the on line program, just know you won't be using the App for any real accounting."
Love this app. Such a clean and well developed app for Quickbooks! Love it!
"A great start 5 stars once more features released. I remember when I used to hate Quickbooks and especially their phone support.

Things very different now. I think Freshbooks has set a standard in customer service that Quickbooks is trying to match.

The result?  Both firms offer first class tech support with Freshbooks having the edge in ease of use but Quickbooks offering more features.

Well done Quickbooks huge improvement."
Love it. Well  I love this app.  I never thought bookkeeping could be this fun and easy. Thanks for making the program
Great App. Great App.  Can grab my IPad anywhere and do what I need to do.
Needs Work & Capability. For those of us that work on the road and try to reconcile books daily, DO NOT DEPEND ON THIS APP because it is non-existent.  No reconcile function whatsoever.  I hope their team listens to our feedback because we can jump ship on any given day.
Why bother?. Don't understand why they bothered developing this app? Much more functionality available using safari and logging into quickbooks!
"Report must show sales receipts as well. Reports must show sales receipts as well and not only invoices. QB allows you to generate sales receipts for customers who paid at the point of sale, hence the report functionality in the app must show these receipts as sales otherwise, the whole report is meaningless. 

Also, more basic reports are needed such as p&l, balance sheet, suppliers, transactions....etc. 

Thx anyway."
I rely on online sync with my external banks. I'm disappointed the subscription I pay for is not mobile. I imagine it would take a lot of programming to include sync on mobile tablets but if it's already hosted on the server, why No access? I'm not a architect but I imagine outsourcing the sync hardware off the tablet you could get your current transactions on mobile . Maybe I'm crazy
"Mr. Trying to type this review the second time.
First time have typed up a review, I was told my chosen nickname is taken and the whole text disappeared!
Basically app is waste of time!
Not all of my set suppliers are displaying. 
For an accounting program it should be spot on before publishing.
I would not trust this app.
Beware!"
Great App. This app is great and easy to use
needs more. Needs way more functionality. Too few procedures allowed on mobile app.  Would have expected more from quickbooks
"Works great!. I am a new business owner and I have QB online on my PC, iPad and iPhone. It is great to be able to record expenses and take photos of the receipts right when it happens rather than waiting until later and possibly forgetting.
No issues found so far!"
"Needs work. I want to be mobile but this app won't let me select different dates for items on invoices or employee hours.
Please make it more functional."
A good idea but not very useful yet. There is not access to the important online reports.  There is no access to fx transactions or accounts in a foreign currency.  I live overseas and bill my clients in us dollars and as such have no access to client information or us dollars sales and accounts. If the app mirrored the online program it would be great but it doesnt!!
Needs work. Purchased the monthly subscription today and loved the ease of setup. But......quickly there after we realized it's not really all that mobile. You must use a desktop to enter inventory, and then you can't check inventory levels from a mobile device. As far as using it as a desktop only, that cannot be done either because you can only make invoices if you know all of your part numbers, there is no filtered look-up. Bottom line great program that can't really be used entirely from a desktop or iPad/iPhone.
Useless. This app is useless because if you have an online account with Mac or PC you cannot use this app on your iPad! Save your time, don't download it.
Please add more search options. This is a great app to accompany a great service. My only request is that i be able to search for content within invoices themselves. For faster lookup!
"Not what i expected from their description.. As a construction contractor I need to easily account for expenses that are reimbursable by the customer and seamlessly bill the customer for them.  I have to manually re-enter that information into their generic invoice.  It is not yet a mature integrated solution for this simple accounting need.  Alas I am a paying subscriber to Quickbooks Online and have moved my books over to this service.  Hopefully they are responsive to this need.

Additionally I have to bounce between the iPad app, iPhone app, web browser on the iPad, and a browser on a separate browser on a PC or Mac to be able to use all the functionality of Quickbooks Online.  It seems that all of the features should be app accessible.

It is good but not great nor complete for simple contractor/freelancer needs."
"Not all of the features of quickbooks online. It would be great if this app offered all of the features of quickbooks online but it doesn't.  What it does do is give a one way look into your quickbooks file.
I'll just login from a browser."
Excellent!!!. I just love this app. I has allow me to invoice and collect payment at the point of sale without the paper work fuzz. It has allow me to improve my cash flow while increasing my efficiency while I am in the field. My only regret, I should have implemented much sooner into my mobile service.
Amazing. Great app. Changed my life and vastly helped with my business. Very smart and useful program. Highly recommend!
Like. Nice app , liked
Best app for any business. I'm a musician and this app helps keep track of all my gigs and insures proper payment!
"Owner. App is very good and QBO is exceptional...except for a flaw which is critical to any business that attaches notes or comments to an estimate or invoice. This app only allows text notes to be attached to estimates/invoices on a mobile device. They cannot be viewed on a PC or Mac which has to use the web browser. It is so frustrating because our office staff can only view the notes if they have a mobile device.There is no syncing between web and app You can't even create a note on a PC or Mac.   
So much for cloud based."
"Data missing!. There are vendors in our system that do not show up on the ipad. For example CompanyA. When I go to make an expense entry on the ipad app it says that vendor is not in the system. When I try to create a new vendor named CompanyA it says that vendor already exists and won't let me create the duplicate vendor. So there is no way for me to enter that expense on the ipad. When I enter it online on my mac, there is no problem. Go back and try looking at the same expense on the ipad and it shows the expense but no vendor linked to it, like CompanyA doesn't exist! So frustrating!

This makes it useless for me! Customer service offered no fixes either."
"Hilfreiche Ergänzung. Obwohl die App nur auf Englisch vorliegt und damit die Bedienung manchmal ""erraten"" werden muss, ist sie eine gute Ergänzung zur PC-Anwendung Quickbooks online. 
Es gibt zwar einige Einschränkungen insbesondere bei den Einstellungen, die teilweise nur am PC geändert werden können, aber für Auswertungen oder schnelle Eingaben unterwegs durchaus nützlich."
Like it but needs more features. I can do everything I need to from this app. I would like to see the ability to create purchase orders and pay bills & I just wish they had more integration with Paypal.
Makes business happen!. This powerful app makes my business happen! Very easy to make sales on the go and keep track of all my ins and outs. Thank you!
Doesn't work. App doesn't sync all data with quickbooks online. I see only my company name and customer list. No invoices, expenses etc. Intuit support we're not able to help.
BMB. Have been using app for several months now.  It is both good and bad.  I love that I can take my work with me to record with my IPad, but would like to be able to transfer transactions from QuickBooks Online to QuickBooks Pro 2014.
Daily user of this app. Getting better and better keep up the development I appreciate it.
Easy to use, no enough control. The app looks great and is easy to use. It does not however, give me basic options. One example is that I can't seem to add the cost of materials and labor for an item that I sell. Only the price of the sale. I have to manually add in expenses for each item. It's tedious and doesn't give me a good reading of how my business is doing.
Great app. Best app ever for a mobile business.
Superb!. I've been a small business owner for about 8 years and a true fan and user of the QB desktop version, but this app covers all the bases I need covered and makes invoicing customers so much easier.   While it may lack some of the features and polish that are on the desktop version, for a one man band like myself, this is perfect and works brilliantly.  Only issue I've come across is a couple of times when I've emailed invoices they did not go out.  So now I cc one to myself so I know it went.  Otherwise, this app is nothing but first class!
Excellent!!. Never a fan of having to purchase QB every year or so to stay up to date.  Appreciate the monthly fee even though it is more expensive than buying the program version.  The way QBs ties in to my bank account and does most all of the check register work is very helpful for me and allows more time for other things.
Need to be able to access full site. Maybe I haven't had enough coffee but most mobile apps allow one to bypass the app and go straight to the web based version.  This is frustrating - trying to quickly locate a reconcile issue in the register and can't see the data I need to effectively do so...
QBO user. Can't say I'm impressed. Sure, it has your company info in it. But the most important functionality for a mobile user is time tracking. But there is no way to enter time on the run, in this app, that I can see.
App. Very god
"Finally. Finally Intuit listened and added access to account registers to this App. Now my accounting program tells me how much money I have, owe and are owed. Thanks!!
Once the new online interface harmony is 100% compatible on mobile devices this App can finally go away for good."
"Needs features. App seems to get bug fixes but vary rarely does it get new features. As a mobile professional I would like to have the same features in the app as on the computer. Currently investigating other more powerful mobile options vs quick books

Update: can't even enter expenses with the app only a pc! In the USA they can enter expenses with the app.... Wish I could deduct an extra star just for that."
Ouickbooks. Setting up this Quickbooks app is a joke , the system does not work and customer support has an attitude that is not willing to help!
No longer loads. After upgrading quickbooks online, this app no longer loads on iPad or iPhone. Please fix.
Mobile app for online QBB has problems. Today has been particularly difficult when an invoice won't save. QuickBooks tells me it is safe in the cloud, but it never is. Now I keep getting a message on my iPad that my log in has expired, even though I just logged in. Please fix this stuff. QuickBooks is great when it works,
"Missing the ability to record bills in app. Really can't believe they missed the opportunity to take photos of invoices we receive using the iPad.

Apart from that it's a excellent app"
"Pretty useless. Can't mark an expense as billable
Therefore can't create invoices by automatically including up billed expenses

Can't record deposits

Can't view downloaded trans action

Useless"
Junk. This app is an embarrassment to use. Doesn't attach correct to emails, rude default email tags, and prints too light to fax. I used QB contractor for 10 years before being talked into ipad by apple as the way to go mobile. Save your money do things right. This freezes up a lot too which if you have time to wait May be for you.
Horrible. This app is horrible. It's a complete waste of space. It has no real functionality worth talking about. It is no better than the mobile site which is also useless.
Lame. I don't understand how anyone can make an app that isn't fully functional on an iPad.
No link. Why is there no simple way to link it to computer to send information. Who made this useless app
Great app. One of the best app on my iPad. Great for auto repair invoicing. +++++
"Is anyone home?. I give this app one star because it doesn't let you select zero stars! All I've gotten for three days is an endless loop telling me that""to use this app you need quickbooks online"". No kidding? I'd love to find some of the application problems some of you are complaining about. At least you can turn yours on!"
Not there yet. I run multiple entities through QBO, and have a very large volume of transactions that need to be classified/matched through the online bank transactions screen.  The app does not allow for classification or matching of transactions, which is all I really want to be able to do while I'm on the go.  Until this functionality is added the app is useless to me.
Lots of Bugs. Been using this app for over a month now for all of my employees, we are constantly running into issues of the credit card payment built into the app not working, unless you set up your employee as an administrator they are unable to edit estimates and invoices, lots of issues, this could be a great app if everything was fixed but there is so many problems not sure if its going to be a good fit for my company, please update your app and fix these issues Intuit!
Won't work on Ipad. I purchased QB Mobile.  I downloaded the app on both my Iphone and my Ipad.  Signing into my iphone works just fine.  When I try to sign in on my Ipad I get an error message saying I need to purchase QB Mobile to be able to use the app, which I already have done.  If anyone has any ideas please let me know.  I'd be happy to add stars to my review if I could actually use the app on my Ipad, which is the main device I wanted to use.
Discussed. App would not download after several tries.
"Disappointing. If you also make ""mint"", why make your subscription service app so much worse?
Mint is great.
This app is not."
Good start. QBO app is a good start, great for on the go invoicing, estimates and receipts.  Paperless ... I use to have customers sign a paper copy invoice on delivery of products, now I can have them sign on my iPad or phone.  Negative reviews saying it is too basic and simple. I don't believe any app is made to be full functioning of its base online application.
"Waste of time!. Total waste of time. I like the Cd version than the online version. I hope Intuit will try to combine the App to include all the features that are on the software version. I am a landscaper and My office needs to be with me outside, not stuck in an office. I need a program where I can take my work with me to my job site. So, when I meet my customers I can give them an an estimate right away on the spot and be able to email to them write away or be able have my customers sign the estimate right away. I would also like do the same with my invoices. It would make it so much easier to count all the footage and labour at the work site - that I don't forget anything and the homeowners can count with me too. On top, I can complete my invoice on the job site and be able to send it to my customers right away. The iPad is much lighter to carry then carrying a laptop.  More people are choosing the laptop over the desktop for convenience, in the same way, one day people are going to choose the iPad over the laptop. I hope Quickbooks can bring that future now. 

I just would like to be able to make my invoices and estimates at a job site, where ever that is, and basically be able to edit it and send it to my customers and have my customers sign my estimates on the job site and fix the deal. Also I would like to be able to enter in my customers payment right away so I don't have to wait tell I get into the office and then enter that in. As well as, have that information on my app be able to easily transfer to my computer when I am able to get into the office. 

Thanks, but Quickbooks should be thanking me because I just showed your companies future -should be headed this way if it is not already thinking of this idea!"
"Useless. I use Quickbooks online extensively at my corporate office.  This app, and what is available through the ""mobile"" website version of QB Online, is useless for getting any work done outside of the office."
How bad????. I would love to write a review, but as I've been trying to get this app to log in to my online account for 5 months now it's going to be a little difficult. But not as difficult as trying to get any customer support for this app. I could write a whole book on how impossible that is. So so disappointed. No help with this problem what so ever. FRUSTRATED!!!!!
Very limited functionality. This might be worthwhile if you need to issue invoices on the go, but that's about it.  You can't manage expenses, checks, etc.  no reports.  Very limited functionality.  It's good if I need to look up a payment I made and already imported through my PC version.
Great and helpful App!. Very easy and lots of good components for business transactions. Good job!
"Terrible!!!. Limited use.  Functionality almost nil.  Editing virtually non-existent.  Appears to emphasize using invoices, I don't use invoices, don't know if that works.  Sync always contains errors in the data....useless and inaccurate.  So, that leaves the rest of us with a QB's app that basically just takes up space. I don't know what hacks are writing this software, but Quickbooks should hire some new blood with talent.

And who is giving this app 3 and 5 stars....REALLY? You must be being paid by the app authors.  No way this app is more than 1 star!!"
Just Awful!!!. Is this seriously how you're going to roll out your app by pissing off customers. Can't even sign in half the time due to 'connection errors'. Your company is an ultra fail.
Terrible product and now doesn't even connect. Previous reviews are on the money, this app is terribly crippled on iPad and mobile. To make it worse some days, like today I can't even connect to do these limited tasks. Intuit please wake up before you get rolled over like blackberry!!!
"Not enough!. This app does not have the functionality that QBO has. Therefore, useless. If we can't use the iPads in the store, what use is the app? 
1. Can't enter an invoice with the details
2. Can't enter a Vendor bill and do splits.
3. Can't put payments in undeposited funds.
 4. Yep, useless."
Don't Bother!. Except for the cost, I really like quickbooks online.  This ipad app is nothing even close and is basically useless.
Complement to QuickBooks online. This app is a complement to QuickBooks online. This Apple really work good for making estimates sending invoices and much more. I wish GoPayment and QuickBooks online were integrated or as one. Other than that, great app.
"This has never worked. I have had this app installed for over four months now and I have never been able to login. It keeps returning server busy try again. The servers been busy for over four months! I can login in the PC and via safari without any issues so I know my details are correct.

My colleague has had the same issue with her ipad and iPhone, for even longer than I have.

It would of been a really useful app, if it ever works!"
Great app but limited. Love the app and how easy it is to use. Would love to be able to input expenses, would make it a 5 star app for me then!
Could be much better.. This app needs lots of work. Is not possible to assign an expense as billable. Is also not possible to add markup from this app. Lame.
A poor mobile companion to QBO. There are so many things wrong with this app. For example, expenses have a note field that doesn't show notes entered in QBO (web). The length of the expense category field is so short that I can't distinguish among categories, especially nested ones. The app generally lacks the functionality it would need to make it a truly useful companion to QBO.
Almost useless. The app is good for sending invoices only. Don't expect to be able to do any other business on the app. The mobile site is about as good as healthcare.gov. You can look at some things but forget everything else. Again good for sending invoices only. I expected more from a established company.
Really Bad App. This app is really bad, lacks everything you would want from a app that is suppose to work with you online quick books. No registry access!
It's about time!. Quickbooks online and the cloud sync apps for iPhone and iPad is nothing short of amazing...it's about time and wow they did such an amazing job with the whole experience.   I love that I can make a receipt for a customer on the spot on my iohone or iPad.
Terrible, embarrassing. After purchasing and downloading the app, It worked fine on day 1.  Tried to open it and show it off...it would not open.  The next day, I gave it another chance.  I successfully created an invoice template and then tried to edit a service.  The app then froze. I will obtain a full refund and never give this another look.
Limited. As far as I can see it's not possible to enter expenses.  Given in many cases businesses have more outgoing transactions that incoming this is a critical weakness.
"Good start but not able to use. In note hand.  
I use other intuit products and like.  I need an App to feed expenses & income to turbo tax foe a small landscape business.
I invoice my customer every 2 weeks for all work & materials used every day during that period.  So I need :
Daily date entry on each line. Not available
Ability to have multiple entry lines on same date, like  labor,  materials, hauling on   dec 10
Then again on dec 11th

Ability to go back & insert lines in order that items occurred. No insertions here

I do not wish for hourly rate to show for labor as it varies per machine & person type. Can not change invoice appearance.

It takes 2 lines plus line spacing too enter each item, making a two week invoice cover 3 + pages that I now get onto 1 page
I can not see how items are going to feed properly into Turbo Tax for Business for proper tax payment.. Ie labor, taxes on labor, fuel charges per machine as purchases r entered, then what about things like mulch or plants I purchase and bill the customer for???

Lots of unanswered questions here.

Thanks"
No good. This app only works if you have the online account version
HOW can I subscribe!!!!!. Love the app, but when I try to subscribe it is impossible to accomplish! What the heck! Can't you make it as simple as a push of a button?
Great upgrade. Great apps. It would be the best, if I was able to enter a bill.
Waste of time. Glad I haven't gotten past the trial offer because NOTHING SYNCS with my Quickbooks online. So the obvious question is WHAT'S THE FREAKING POINT of this app? Completely unimpressed. Someone's making money off of doing nothing. Wow. I want that job!
Disappointed. Just dont think its up to the invoicing apps others are. Need to be able to add pdf attachments from the app. Others can.
Omg. If you don't have it you are missing out. This is the easiest and most helpful app ever.
Useless!. Who is writing these positive reviews? This app is completely useless. It has none of the functionality of QB online, and neither does the mobile version accessible from a browser. With all of the money we spend monthly on QB products, the lack of useable features on mobile devices is extremely disappointing. Can't even get a register balance? Ridiculous!
Disappointing update. Was able to do deposit on the go with earlier version.  Please fix.
Great app!. Works great with my Quickbooks online, fast and easy for taking credit card payments. Everything syncs back to my online account and is very easy and efficient, huge time saver!
Worthless!. Until this app can sync with the desktop version of Quickbooks, It is worthless to my business. I'm sorry I downloaded it. But I have already deleted it.
Great App -- Easy to Use. Enough said. It helps me keep track of my invoicing as well as my expenses. Great for small businesses.
Looks Great!!!. Keep the updates coming!  Great job of being quick to update the app and user interface and continuing to add great features!
Awesome. One of the best Apps I have used for tracking and creating invoices, keeps me on track and easy to use.
Great App. I use this App every day.
"Passwords incompatible with Quickbooks Online www site. We live in an era where passwords from LinkedIn are stolen by hackers and used to commit identity theft by accessing victims accounts who used that same passord twice. Intuit is certainly one of the companies targeted by cyber-criminals.  It is, therefore, incumbent on software designers to urge users towards secure login practices. End users should use cryptographically complex passwords that are unique to each website they visit. This is especially true for financial institutions. Quickbooks seems to do everything wrong in this respect. One such case in point:

Quckbooks iPad app does not allow long, cryptographically strong, passwords.

Detail: the iPad app will not allow users to paste in a password at the login screen that is in excess of 31 characters. Passwords of 32 characters or more ARE, in fact, allowed at the Quickbooks Online site.  This forces users to change their passwords to something shorter potentially reducing the entropy. Changing the password on the QBO site is not easy and seems to require a call to their support number to complete.

It's not just inconvenient but seems a bit insecure for Intuit to force use of short passwords. It's downright irresponsible of them to not list what the password length on the login screen. This sends their clients into potentially hours of troubleshooting when a short line like ""passwords up to 31 characters in length"" would have solved the problem. 

Please urge Intuit to fix this issue and allow the same length passwords at the QB Online site as on the iPad.

--Athonia"
"App does not allow long passwords. I use long, cryptographically complex passwords that are unique to each website I visit. This is especially true for financial institutions. Quickbooks has done something in their iOS app to disallow pasting of lengthy passwords.

Detail: the iPad app will not allow users to paste in a password at the login screen that is in excess of 31 characters. Passwords of 32 characters or more ARE, in fact, allowed at the Quickbooks Online site.  

It seems insecure for Intuit to be promoting a culture of using short, non unique passwords for login to something like quickbooks that holds the keys to the castle for all of it's customer's financial institutions. Please urge Intuit to fix this issue and allow the same length passwords at the QB Online site as on the iPad.

QBO saves us time and unnecessary work.. We love using the app at our company.  Integrating the payments and signing contracts on iPads has helped make a huge difference.
Awesome product. General contractor have tried a lot of different apps and have spent a few hundred bucks...this one by far is the best for invoicing and providing estimates. Very streamlined and quick to learn..
Curious???. I own a paint contracting business and we work all over NJ and NY. I need to be mobile with the ability to run all positions of my business to keep that professional image along with being prompt on sending estimates and invoices. QBO gives me that full range on the go!! I'm just curious why make an iPad App that seems to have limited features when you can NOW simply logon through Safari on your iPad have FULL features as if in your office behind computer?? Any, amazing job on QBO all together. Give the iPhone App full features and i'll award 5 stars ;)
"Awesome. I have an HVAC business and everything in this app is awesome. The invoicing,estimates,collecting payments, emailing invoices or estimates, 
the whole thing. My wife does the books and she loves this version of quickbooks better than the pro version. I can access it from my iPad or iPhone and my wife can access it from her samsung phone. All around great app. You do have to have the quickbooks online version on a computer and it has a monthly fee, but well worth it."
Love this app. Great app would recommend to everyone.
QB APP. Not useful as it could be as  you can't enter a Bill! Not being able to enter a bill makes it useless to work from an iPad or tablet device.
"Roy. Great for on the go work.
Would be even better if you could request payment from the app.
(IPN) then you get a 10 STAR."
Poor functionality. For a mobile accounting app this is next to useless for me. Surely the whole point of a mobile app is to not have to be tied to a computer. You can't even enter bills on the app which I would have thought would be one of the things that most users would want to do in Quickbooks on a daily basis - at least I do. There's also no way to run VAT reports so again I would be tied to my computer. Not yet good enough.
Love it!!!. I am a tile contractor and use this app everyday. I love the latest update where the customer can sign the estimate.
"I love how this app Crashes every time.. Can't even test the app as it crashes on the login screen.

Finally got past the login screen but it crashes as soon as I try to get into settings. 

I'm sorry Quickbooks but my company can't operate properly and efficiently with such a buggy program. We need to be mobile and can't have apps that crash in the field. 

I've been using QBO since the beginning and we will have to move on to another program that's stable, has more feature, and will also allow us to do service schedule out in the field m

It's been fun but so long QBO. Hope some day you'll figure it out."
Great App. If the sales history chart can show more than one year will be perfect ( at least 2 yrs )
Great. Great app. Love all the online offerings!
clean and wonderful app. we love qb for i pad.
"Thanks for adding Sales receipt. And specially when integrate the go payment charge option into this app.

It will be nice to include the sales recite transaction in the reports and not only invoices.

Also in the notes section to add integration with Dropbox and  G drive, now only have photo option"
Fantastic!. I love this app.  It works really well, and makes it easy for me to stay on-top of invoicing my customers.
Only basics. The app appears to make available only the very basic functions. I don't see Reports, and I signed on to complete some Company Preferences, add Classes, and set opening chart of accounts. None of these are functional.
Useless app. Hard and bad wrote app. can't use many of the functions of regular online version.
Good app. I've come to like the app as I've explored it. It allows you more options in one device instead of having multiple devices to complete your work. Plus it's portable and can be used at home or on the road
Great app. After a little getting used to, this app works well.  We're a small construction company that works two to three jobs all over the southeast.  We've used Quickbooks desktop for years, but as we've grown, jobs have taken my partners and I to different regions at the same time.  QB online app allows us to ensure that all bids are taken care of, and allows us to see who's doing what.
Does not support accounting functions. Quickooks is first and foremost an accounting application.  This app does not provide for reviewing financial statements, reviewing expense categories (ie cost of goods sold, office expense, etc) and does not allow correction of mis- applied expense items.  From an accounting and control viewpoint, I think it is almost useless
Great. This app makes doing business efficiently even easier!  I love it
This is what the iPhone app should have been. So much more functionality than the phone app.   Yeah, it doesn't have reports, but it does have invoicing and transactions, which is great to have access to on the fly.   Hope they keep improving, but this is a great start for me.
Amazing app. So great to use! Still missing few features but gets the job done
Won't connect to QB Online since update.. I've been using QB for iPad with few issues to date, until the latest update. Now, I'm on a job, trying to invoice a customer and can not since the app will not connect to QB Online.
Needs work. I am a long time QB user.  The desktop being the best version of this software.  The online version coming in a distant second.  However, this app, while it is a great idea, needs to come a LONG way.  Most of the basic features I use daily, like a quick Balance Sheet or P&L report don't appear available.  I cannot even find a list of accounts to view.  If I am going to be using an iPad for QB it is going to be to look stuff up or run reports.  Neither of these seem to be available at the moment.  Entering expenses and invoices, which do appear,  I am generally going to do at a desk when I am paying bills.  Quickbooks itself is a great software.  Hopefully, they can get this app to be a bit more useful.
Great app. It's great to manage a small business.
Great app for the IPAD. Great app for the IPad and small buisness
Awesome. Great app for the iPad. I hate complicated software a to tract my work. This ones the most user friendly app I've come across. Great recommendation. 5*****'s
"Be careful  you will be charged $12,99 a month. Did not know this app was going to cost me $12.99 a month. They make it hard to cancel. No unsubscribe or any other function
If you don't want a monthly cost...don't download"
Way too limited. The app for the iPad is too basic. I can create an invoice and email or print but if I need to print an existing invoice there is no option to do this. After receiving payments there is no way to deposit them to my bank. I can't believe that QB would release an app before testing it. I am hoping that there will be an upgrade soon to make it functional.  Disappointed!
"What it does, it does well.. With the caveat that it does so very little. Want to set up bank accounts? Tax codes? Absolutely anything besides adding customers and basic invoices? Gotta use a browser. But WAIT! Don't bother trying to do it from your iPad, or you'll get redirected to an even more useless, hard to navigate site where you STILL can't do much useful. In order to do anything involved in setting up a company profile beyond name and address, you have to log in from a desktop computer. 

This app has the potential to be very good, but it is so completely lacking in features that it makes using it impossible for any serious business. In order for this to be worthwhile, it needs to access every setting and field available from a desktop browser. Until then, you're seriously better off with a pencil and slide-rule than trying to work with this. I was considering using this when my desktop version of QB is no longer supported in a year, but until I can actually use it to, you-know, run a business, I'll gladly pass on this ""upgrade."""
Not Available?. I need this app to work with my UK Quickbooks account that handles multiple currencies. The iPhone App is at least functional but lacking many features.
I need to actually work!. This would be an awesome app if I could do more than just send estimates and invoices.  There are other tasks that need to be done and it would be really helpful if you could do everything that you can do online.
"Great tool for the field!. We use this on iphone (as old as 3gs) and ipad (2nd gen), haven't installed the most recent update, but so far haven't encountered the bugs some are reporting. 
It is a very useful tool in the field for many purposes although it isn't the complete desktop experience. If you need to create estimates, invoices, input new clients or update data it's excellent. Create an invoice and email it on site of the job or sale. 
You can review expenses, but it's not really for paying bills or managing bank accounts at this point.
What it does, it does well and functionality is steadily improving. 

Definitely worth having if you are QB online user. 
FYI: It's strictly aimed at those who do their bookkeeping online; it isn't meant to interface with desktop only versions of QB."
"Nothing syncs. I manage 7 companies with QB Online. I recommend QB Online to anyone managing a company's finances. This app, however is NOT GOOD. If you have jobs or sub customers or sub items, they don't sync. Invoices paid show as overdue if that customer is a sub customer or is an inactive or deleted customer. Void an invoice online, not so fast. It's still there in the app. I tested this app briefly and bought an iPad to be able to manage companies with a quick app interface, not so smart. Bottom line, the app needs updates. Beware, the data it portrays is not accurate. Your customers are not past due so don't call them, they already paid!

The app is worthless UNLESS you want to manage a company in its simplest form ONLY USING THIS APP. I think an artist at an art fair, a lawn mowing company, a small simple company could use this app and an iPad and be completely mobile."
Trouble with Pin log in. Love the app, however latest upgrade requires that I type in my password every time I turn on the app, even though pin in set to ON. Tried turning setting off and on, doesn't help. Hopefully you will fix this on next upgrade. Pin log does not work.
QBooks Online. The windows version is pretty decent but the mobile app is horrible. The invoicing option is not that great. I give it 2 star just because it is accessible from every where.
"A good start but missing features. As a neglected Mac user, Quickbooks has been a source of frustration and disappointment for years. I hate being treated as a second class citizen by Intuit. 

When I was forced to upgrade my desktop version of Quickbooks 2010 for Mac, I decided to look for another solution. It's too bad that none of the accounting apps for Mac don't have all the features that I need to make small business accounting easy like integrated payroll, vendor and contractor payments.

After reading an article on Macworld's site by Joe Kissell, I took a look at Quickbooks Online. It was the best solution for me. After I added up all the monthly fees for payroll, paying vendors electronically and the cost of the desktop app, QBO was within a few bucks I was already paying and everything is integrated which meant no going back and forth importing from different apps and services. Finally a one stop and very easy and convenient solution! And being a Costco member gives me an even better price so I end up paying less than I was paying before. 

On to the iOS QBO app... It's a great start, but I'd really like to be able to download and reconcile my bank account, run payroll and pay vendors inside the app. If I could do that, it'd be an easy 5 stars."
Not detailed enough. If they're going to let you invoice from the iPad, you should be able to enter/change and see all the fields that you can from a desktop the way you have set up your invoice format.  I travel often and need to invoice from the road but can't send invoices the way they need to look - can't change ship to, can't use personalized fields.  Very disappointed in this app.
Very Limited, Worthless. When I'm on the road, I need to enter deposits my office makes into various accounts, I need to enter receipts into registers, and I need to reconcile bank accounts.  Not only does this app prevent these very basic functions, if I attempt to access their web site through a browser on my iPad, QB Online has chosen to prevent me to do this by routing me to a separate site that is designed to significantly limit my ability to do anything worthwhile.
"disappointing. I've been a long-time user of the desktop version of Quickbooks for the past 20 years and just recently switched to Quickbooks Online. I was really looking forward to managing my company's expenses, print checks, and enter bills from my new iPad. 

I am terribly disappointed in the complete lack of features available in this app. It's actually completely useless and a waste of memory. How could Intuit release such a piece of garbage such as this?"
Do not update!!! Horrible!!. If you use this app for everyday business like I do do not update it. I have been using it fine for weeks ,then I updated thinking it would be less buggy, Wrong !! The app doesn't even work now ,boy did I look like i didn't know what I was doing in front of my customer. What a horrible experience and canceling quick books right away and going back to paper invoices until these non brained developers actually test the software first.
"Great but. I think this app looks great.  It is not supposed to be a stand alone accounting app at this time.  It is supposed to be a companion to the online version.

So far it seems to flow better then the iPhone version and it fixed some of the bugs.  

Main problem so far is you can not open up items boxes when filling out a estimate or invoice.  You can scroll but if you have a long description this is just impractical.  You can do this with the iPhone app so I see no reason why we should not be able to on the bigger format.   Without this feature it forces us to still use the iPhone app.

I believe QB Online is moving in the right direction.  The are adding and updating all the time.  

That being said I hate to do it but will have to give it just two stars for now.  I believe one other review was right in that they really do need to get some heavy users like myself and others that use QB Online and adapt it a lot to make it work over other software like Wintac etc...."
Needs more. I don't mind the app for our company. We hand write all of our invoices for the customer so the one thing I really wish you could do is put your own invoice number in.
No sales receipts. This app is pretty decent, but lacks the essential functionality of sales receipts. GoPayment isn't a solution either because it doesn't link to customers. When can we expect sales receipt functionality?
Awesome. A great app that I use frequently to help organize my buisness
Great app. I love this App
Great. Great App!!
"Login will not allow me to paste my password. I use Quickbooks online, so I use a very strong password that is stored in an app (1password). It would be extremely annoying to hand type a 25 character random password into this app. And I'm unwilling to compromise my security for my online financial data. 

Therefore this app is totally useless to me."
Great App!. I have used Quickbooks for years and love their software. This application takes their wonderful software to a whole new level. The mobility and ease of use are excellent! The App is well built and very easy to use. It integrates well with your main Quickbooks program and syncs all your data in real time. A+++
Perfect. This is a great app and works perfect for my business
"Negative stars - if possible. I find it amazing intuit promotes such an obvious clunker.  Why don't they just buy square and tie that in - or at least imitate it.  Intuit is lost when it comes to transactional businesses. 

At any rate - as almost all users point out here - this app is useless and should be an embarrassment to intuits development team."
"Excellent for really small businesses. I'm a sole prop and this app is perfect for me. With a business that is mostly services-based (and no payroll), this app gives me exactly what I need in terms of creating and editing invoices and quick reports. A lot of people are complaining about the lack of reports, and maybe that's true for larger businesses, but being able to quickly see income and expenses is all I need ""on the go."" It's supposed to be a helpful app - not the entire quickbooks system. If I want in depth reports I go to the actual computer. Not a problem."
Terrible app. This app is not even close to what you expect it does not do what your quick books does. There is no way to change product descriptions without having to rewrite the whole item. It does not link to quick books in trial mode and not sure if I want to pay for this service. Bottom line this is not what you would expect I think they are still working the bugs out buy some other app.
Love this app!! Definitely recommend!!. I am a freelancer and have found this app VERY useful as a companion to my QB online! I dare say I might like to use the app more than the OL version (except that the app doesn't do all that the full version does online) but for about $12/month for QB online and the ability to use this app.. I love it!! The app is SO user friendly and visually appealing.. Easy to use! Makes invoicing my clients and getting paid a BREEZE! I can even attach a photo copy of the work I did to their invoice. So helpful!
Sales Receipts Please. Can you add the option to add sales receipts please? Great app, thank you.
Fixed, Really?. I waited and waited for this app to come. The app itself works wonderful, with the exception that the invoice created can only be sent from the iPad. Because of this if my customer uses anything other than WebMail they do not get the attached PDF since the App encloses the PDF onto the body of the email as opposed to it being attached. When I submitted a ticket for this issue I was told this is a known problem and the ticket was closed. Really, instead of creating a means of getting the invoice to the customer the ticket just got closed? I guess it is back to opening the laptop and logging in to the full site since trying to go to the full site via the iPad is severely limited.
Good app with room for Improvement. The features they have work well, but many of the features on the website are not included.  It has many of the customer options, but not much else. If they ever make this a fully functional app, I'll give it 5 stars.
Worthless App. I was excited to find this app and, unfortunately, downloaded it. I really cannot figure out what is good for other than creating invoices. Confusing when you open the app, it does not get better as you get into it, not that there is anything to get into. I run a small non profit & just found this app useless, except for taking up space. What a pity as I have been a QB user for years.
Love it. I love this app, just doing what I want
"Embarrassingly Bad!. I am not sure wether I am more stunned by how bad this app is or how it managed to get 3 1/2 stars. Reading some of the 5 star reviews though (""good enough to get rid of my desktop version"") I can only assume that they have been left by ""friends"" of Intuit. There isn't a single CPA or business women/men who would give this App more then 1 star or actually use this App for anything. Most shockingly this App won't give you access to your list of accounts. Yup - thats right you won't see your checking, saving, AP or AR accounts in this app or even their balances. Come again?

Now how can a business accounting App be close to replacing its big brother desktop version when it actually won't give you even the tiniest idea of your financial situation, account balances, account receivables or payables, nor let you make any registry entries? Good question. Of course it isn't anywhere near that and comments like that are quiet frankly offensively dumb as they have clearly not been left by anyone who actually does small business accounting.

This App does absolutely nothing and I can only assume that Intuit (like most corporations) has either outsourced this to a developer with no accounting knowledge or has (like most corporations) gotten rid of all their senior staff members with actual small business accounting workflow background and is now run by a bunch of thirty somethings with a shiny MBA but no actual life experience or first hand knowledge of accounting work flows.

Still even under those circumstances this App is embarrassingly Bad!"
"Lame First Attempt - Try Again Please. This app leaves so much to be desired.  I would expect maybe 50-80% of the functionality of the online version of quickbooks.

But, this only provides a few very basic things.  And, things that are already handled by the iphone version of the app.

It seems like whoever is designing these apps doesn't actually use QuickBooks and doesn't understand what is really needed.

using QuickBooks for iPad, I should be able to: run reports (as I do online), create invoices from employee time, enter time, match downloaded transactions.

This app just doesn't make sense.  Who cares about a list of activities, I want to see my information organized the way it is online."
Good start. This app is a long way off from being useful in the field. Don't get me wrong, the pie charts and colorful graphs look really cool and may even convey a lot of info quickly, but as far as practical use this app needs work. I'm sure in a few months as features come online this app will be great in the field. But until then stick with Intuit's quickbooks mobile app, (designed for iPhone) they've finally got that one to the point where it actually works and saves time.  It works on the iPad too.
"Pretty much useless. Have been a QB online user for years and my account is setup for a non-profit foundation, i.e. we don't have customers, but have a lot of transactions.

This app is totally focused on users who have customers, but for my use, I can't see my bank register, can't run reports, can't look back at transactions more than a year ago (essential when doing multi-year grants), can't manage payroll, pay taxes, see my to-do list, and can't reconcile.

Presentation and formatting is primitive (Hello - 1993 called... they want their user interface back!)

The Help system is pretty funny. Not really a true ""help"" system, but more of a FAQ. Virtually all of the answers to the FAQ questions start with: ""Go to your Web based QB Online and do the operation there."" How about some functionality and help regarding this app, not excuses for the lack of features.

For anybody who plans to download this app, sign up for QB Online, and plans to run their business using this app, don't even think about it. There's so much missing that you could never run your business accounting with an iPad and this app.

Thumbs down on this one!"
Great ap. Great easy to use app really close to getting rid of my laptop entirely
Awesome!. Absolutely love this app. I am able manage all of my clients on the go, create invoices and receive payments. The only issue I have is that it won't allow me to email invoices or provide the pay online option.
Awesome job on the IPad app!. Really needed this app for quickbooks to keep me mobile. I needed to use quickbooks online but was unable to use my iPad for quickbooks now I can! Keep up with the tweaks but I love it!
Great app. The only thing this app is missing is being able to generate reports. Give me that and i'd gladly pay a few bucks for this wonderful tool. Saves me a lot of time
Great!. The iPad QB app works great! As a plus the support and development people are very respectful and helpful when it comes to suggestions to make the app even better. To be able to be completely mobile for a small business means you can be more efficient and get paid faster. The only thing the app is lacking is signature capture and then it will be everything you need and there will be no need for apps like InvoiceASAP.
"Phenomenal product. QuickBook's has really made a great product! We used the free trial version for about 10 days then we purchased the full version. The iPad app is incredible. Usually I'm having a cup of coffee in the morning when it alerts me how many invoices are overdue. These alerts appear at the top part of the screen, the same way text messages appear, as a notification. Then when you can go in and take a look at everything that's happening with your accounts. Really, it gives you a Bird-Eye View of your business operations.

I'm a guy who failed accounting TWICE in college. If this app makes accounting fun for me, that's an enormous achievement. 

Competing products in the same price range do not even come close, such as sageOne. I know because we tried it also before we purchased QuickBooks. Competitors have nowhere near the features of QuickBooks. 

With QuickBooks your data is backed up in the cloud each time you save, and on multiple drives for added protection (read their literature). You can even access the iPad app offline, although you won't be able to create new invoices or make changes - but it's great in a pinch to be able to see whats going on even if you don't have Internet connectivity.

Overall, ""A+"" for QuickBooks Online. Very happy with it."
"Awesome!. Great job! Better late then never! 

We are an iPad company and we have to keep a bunch of PCs around just to enter our QB data. Now we can finally ditch a couple of the PCs. Looking forward to more updates on this app! Us small business owners need full functionality plus more from our QB app. The features I would like to see on future updates:

- Customer can sign invoice in the field
- Can print invoices and reports via Airprint
- Access to our Balance Sheet
- Custom date options on P&L and other reports
- Build in payroll into this one app"
Using new app for a week- more problems longer I use it. Really unhappy - I am missing data and receiving error messages and my only option for assistance is to use a form. Am completely disappointed in Quickbooks. Limited functionality! Come on Intuit can't do any better than this and keep up with the times- I have to use a computer or laptop to get full functionality?!
Finally!. This app does all that I've wanted - expenses and all. Good to se QBO is working at this. Love the mobile experience.
Useless. This app is useless. You can't even see your check register.  Pathetic.
Not even good for a beta from a garage based business. Like others, it's surprising that Intuit released this to the App Store with very little functional difference. Without a Chart of Accounts, product/service list, sales receipts (my primary need to use this as an overflow checkout option for clients paying for services on the spot) and some limited reports - this app is useless! I thought the other reviewers were being harsh, but I think they were being nice! This app single-handedly makes my iPad a paperweight.
Overdue but great! Gorgeous!. This app is way, way overdue, but at least they got it right the first time around. No it doesn't do everything the website does, but nailed, adding buttons (functionality) is the easy part. It's definitely one of the best looking apps on my iPad.
"Waste of Space. All we want to do is access quick books online via our iPads. This app is worthless. 

As my business continues to grow we will obviously be looking for a software provider that listens to clients instead of putting out disappointments like this.

Save the space on your iPad and don't bother."
"Worthless for these reasons. What we have come to expect from the monopoly of accounting software. 

It lacks a ton of features that make it unusable, while adding such worthless features as importing people's Facebook profile pictures and posting to Yelp! - really?!

1. You can't specify a sales rep on an invoice.
2. You can't enter a custom invoice number.
3. You can't specify whether or not to allow the recipient to pay online.
4. You can't specify a reference or PO or custom field notation on an invoice. 
5. The display for the recent invoices list, well, you have to see it to believe it - it looks like the Periodic Table spilled on your screen.
6. I could go on and on and on...

Why can't we just access the website through our iPad web browser? We wait years for this - how disappointing, but what do long-time users of Intuit really expect? This is what happens when there is no competition."
Beyond useless. I have long been frustrated by Intuit's decision to bar users on iPads from accessing any real functionality in Quickbooks. I thought this app might address that problem, but it does not.  It does not offer anything useful to me.
All GUI no substance. As a business owner, I want native apps that allow me to do all major functions that are available on the desktop/web version.  I want to see everything and do anything from anywhere in a simple clean interface.  This app just fails to meet my expectations...I see no reason to use it.
Crashing all the time. I know it's version 1.0, but still. It's crashing left, right and center all the time. You may want to wait 6-8 months before this app is stable.
"Scalled Back but reliable. This app seems to work as intended, flawlessly. I like the sign features. Seems secure.

It is definitely scaled back. If you want access to your chart of accounts, particularly your bank registers it is not available. Hopefully that will be an update in the near future.

Good access to customers and vendors.

Great for creating a quick invoice on the go. Needs more options for sending invoices and sales receipts ETC.  

Overall the app works as described. Read carefully for functions available. It might not work for some people.

I use Google Chrome to access the full website on my ipad3. Doesn't work perfect however it does offer a few more options then this app."
Pathetic. When will Intuit wake up and get a real program for the Ipad?  Very limited unless all you want is invoicing....disappointed....was hopeful at one point but have had it with Intuit
"Not Bad. This is a huge improvement over the standard quickbooks mobile apps.

Unfortunately, the deal breaker for me is that it still does not seem to include a way to capture a signature on invoices.  Many of my clients require a signature on each invoice that I forward to them, so I must continute to use my existing solution.

I have hopes that this will be addresed in the future, as it otherwise seems to be an excellent product."
Have been waiting to get this app. Awesome!. Great app! Easy to use. Wish I can take payments from this app.
